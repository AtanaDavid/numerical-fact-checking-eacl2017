66 min: A lovely little bit of skill from Hoolahan, rolling the ball one way then the other, gives him half a yard, and he passes to McClean down the left wing. The substitute slightly over-runs it though and the ball goes out for a goal kick.
“I’ve been dreading this moment. McClean makes me nervous as hell. 26 minutes is plenty of time to do a lot of rash, silly, and dangerous things,” writes J.R. in Illinois.
