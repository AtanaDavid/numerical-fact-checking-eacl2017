Middlesbrough’s players and fans will be disappointed. It might seem like I’m stating the obvious, but they’ll be gutted with their team’s overall performance as well as the result. Boro never really seemed to get going and were thoroughly outclassed in a first half in which Norwich just blew them out of the water.
Later, in the second half when you’d expect them to put NOrwich’s goal under siege, it never really happened for them. Norwich never looked flustered or in any difficulty, Aitor Karanka’s decision to play Patrick Bamford, who was clearly unfit, for the entire 90 minutes was bewildering, but even with the Chelsea loanee firing on all cylinders, Norwich would have taken some beating today.
