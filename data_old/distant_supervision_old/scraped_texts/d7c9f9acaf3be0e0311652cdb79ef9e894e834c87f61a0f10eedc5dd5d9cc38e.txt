As if to give the galleries’s larynxes a rest they “only” parred the fifth but were back amongst them again with a pair of fours on the par-five fifth. Birdies had suddenly become par for this magical duo. Except on the Postage Stamp, Mickelson cracked.
He spun it into five feet on the classic 125-yarder, but missed after Stenson had converted his 12-footer. If any proof was needed that this was now a matchplay spectacle then here it was.
And so they went on, both birdieing the 10th. Surely Troon’s notorious back nine would sort them out? Would it hell. Stenson did bogey the 11  th   but moved ahead again with a 20-footer on the par-three 14th  . It was the 15th   when the drama boiled over. Stenson holed from 50-feet, punched the air and Mickelson looked shellshocked.
