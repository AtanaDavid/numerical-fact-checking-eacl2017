With parents pinching pennies and college costs rising, more teens are expected to search for part-time and summer jobs this year.
"They may not have the allowance they are used to. They're going to be looking for ways to replace what was taken from them," said Karen S. Hinds, author of "A Teenager's Guide to the Workplace." ''For some students, it might well be replacing an income in the family."
That would reverse a decades-long downward trend in teen employment since the 1980s. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2008, 32.6 percent of teens ages 16-19 were employed, a historic low, down from 45.2 percent in 2000.
Fewer teens have part-time jobs today because they stay in school longer, spend more time studying and have less free time, according to a report from market research firm Mintel. Baby boomer parents have told children their job is getting into college, so many teens haven't felt compelled to work, said Susan Beacham, founder and CEO of Money Savvy Generation.
"We have given our children the No. 1 job of school because we have always been able to take care of college," she said. She thinks kids will be better off with work experience, but in today's economy, there's no guarantee they'll find a job if they want it.
