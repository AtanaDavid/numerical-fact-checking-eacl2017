Thomas Bjorn admits returning to defend his European Masters title at the stunning Crans-sur-Sierre this week brings back memories of joint tournament record-holder Seve Ballesteros.
The 41-year-old Dane, who was recently named one of José María Olazábal’s four vice-captains for next month’s Ryder Cup, stormed to a four-shot victory over Martin Kaymer for back-to-back European Tour wins 12 months ago.
Steeped in history since the tournament moved to the Swiss Alps in 1939, with breathtaking views from every tee box, Bjorn believes Crans Montana is a place where the Tour can reminisce the career of the late Ballesteros, who won the European Masters on three occasions between 1977 and 1989.
“It’s a great place in the players’ hearts,” said the 13-time European Tour champion, who is bidding to become the first player to defend the European Masters since the Spaniard in 1978.
“It comes at a great time where it’s been a long season and you go to Switzerland and there’s good food and good fun and you maybe don’t work as hard as you do normally.
“It’s still growing as a tournament and you have all the memories of Seve and so many other great wins and it just sits well at the venue. It’s a great place.”
Bjorn is also relishing the prospect of returning to the scene that saw him regain his self belief after flying home with a final-round 62.
“It was some Sunday last year, it was just amazing,” he added. “To shoot 62 on the last day was just remarkable.
“Coming off a win at the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles, to go into the final day with that leaderboard – with Rory McIlroy, Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer all up there – and then to go on and win was just special.
“It’s up there with my win in Dubai in 2001, where I played the last round with Tiger Woods. The finish was unbelievable in Crans and you almost feel like you’re losing your chance and then all of a sudden you go bang, bang, bang – birdie, birdie, birdie.
“It was close to a perfect day, it was one of those days where you just sit back afterwards and it’s just an amazing feeling. Even though I won the previous week I still felt I needed that win to prove something and I went and did it.
“I didn’t have the belief on the golf course and I needed that last year, I needed to trust and believe that when it gets tough, I can stand up and hit the golf shots.”
Paul Lawrie, who will make his second Ryder Cup appearance next month, will be hoping to repeat the feat of his Danish counter-part as he goes in search of a second successive victory following his impressive four-shot triumph at the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles last week.
Fellow European Ryder Cup star Peter Hanson and European captain Olazábal have also made the trip, as too in-form trio David Lynn, Jamie Donaldson and 2007 European Masters champion Brett Rumford, who finished second behind Lawrie last week.
