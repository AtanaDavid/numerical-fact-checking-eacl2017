Microsoft officially became a tablet manufacturer in October 2012 when it launched the Surface RT, and at that time, many criticized the company for becoming a rival for its very own partners, competing for the same buyers with devices that were supposed to be designed by other OEMs.
It’s no secret that the Surface RT proved to be a flop, mostly because of Windows RT, but as more time passed by, the company improved its offering and is now at the third-generation Surface lineup made entirely of devices powered by the full version of Windows 8.1.
And according to its chief operating officer, Kevin Turner, the Surface Pro 3 is a winner, as sales since its May 2014 launch have been impressive to say the least. Despite the fact that it’s quite an expensive device, that is.
The Surface Pro 3 comes with very powerful hardware, including a choice of three different processors - Intel i3, i5, or i7, up to 8 GB of RAM, and a maximum of 512 GB of storage space, which makes it quite a rival for many laptops out there. In fact, Microsoft has even promoted the Surface Pro 3 as “a device that can replace your laptop” ever since its launch.
The top model, however, is priced at $1,950 in the United States, so it’s quite pricey, but the Surface Pro 3 is still selling very well, so Turner’s statements at WPC 2015 could be a little surprising for some.
Obviously, everyone’s now waiting for the Surface Pro 4, which according to some sources could debut later this year, but Microsoft is still keeping all details secret for the time being. The Pro 4 will most likely adopt the same strategy as its predecessor and hit the market as a laptop replacement with a premium price.
Undoubtedly, it will be powered by Windows 10 and will come with a removable keyboard and a digital pen.
