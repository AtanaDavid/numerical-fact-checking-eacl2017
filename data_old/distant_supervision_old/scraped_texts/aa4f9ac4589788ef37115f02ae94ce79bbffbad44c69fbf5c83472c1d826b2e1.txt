For the 401st year, the brutal shin kicking championships returned to the Cotswold Olympics at Dover's Hill in England.
Believe it or not, shin kicking is considered a sport, at least in this rural English town.
For over four centuries local contestants have been partaking in the shin kicking championships in Dover's Hill.
In fact, it's one of the area's most popular events, but the brutality means that very few are brave enough to return for a second year.
Last year's champion 24-year-old Zak Warren decided to defend his crown, despite the pain.
[Zak Warren, Defending Shin Kicking Champion]:"This year I'm not going to stand about like I did so much last year taking blows because I was worried about coming anyway due to my knee so I'm literally going to go straight out this year and try wipe them straight to the floor before they get the chance to hit me, but we'll see, we'll see."
The origins of the sport seem fairly lost in time, but one thing is sure -- this variation of wresting can be excruciating.
Warren's opponent in the final was first-time contestant Jeremy Soper who left his footprint on the crowd after turning up in shorts ... That meant he had to improvise when it came to the traditional method of stuffing your pants with hay to limit the damage of the blows.
By the time the final came around, Soper had found a pair of long pants.
[Jeremy Soper, Runner Up]:"Thanks goes to the guy how lent me these trousers, I couldn't have done it without him."
In the end, Warren took the crown again - becoming a rare second year shin-kicking champion.
