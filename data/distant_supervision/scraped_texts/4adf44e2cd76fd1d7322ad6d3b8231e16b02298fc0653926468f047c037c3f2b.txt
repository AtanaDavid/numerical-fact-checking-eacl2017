Thermal electrical generation � which burns domestically produced oil and natural gas � has replaced hydroelectric generation in Mexico. The country is hampered by an inefficient state owned energy sector that suffers from corruption and strangling regulations. The administration of Vincente Fox attempted a reform of the energy sector, which would have required constitutional changes, but was prevented by political opposition. Nevertheless, electricity production in 2003 exceeded domestic consumption. Out of 209.2 kilowatt hours produced, Mexico consumed 193.9 kwh, allowing for the export of 1.07 kwh. The Federal Commission of Electricity operates the electrical power grid.
Mexican homes receive electrical bills every two months, which may be paid at most banks, supermarkets, and even some convenience stores, as well as directly at the electric company. The cost of electricity for a Mexican home can vary widely, depending upon the city and particular neighborhood in which the home is located. In lower middle class homes in the average city, electrical costs can run between $10-50 U.S. dollars per bill, while more affluent homes may spend upwards of $200.
Water bills can vary as widely as electrical bills, running from as little as $5 every two months to as much as $50, depending not only on the local but also on whether the home is metered or pays for service at a fixed rate. There is also a common belief that water is not a service for which one ought to pay, but is a legal �right� that ought to be provided free of charge. This belief has led to a culture of non-payment of water bills in some areas. The issue of water becomes further charged by the fact that water reserves are concentrated in the southern part of the country, while most water consumption occurs in the arid central and northern parts. Thus water sometimes becomes a political issue, often preventing the expansion of services to communities without access to clean water.
State owned water services (which include 2,400 municipal providers and various larger ones that serve 40-50 big cities) control about three quarters of the market, while private companies provide the rest. There are two regulators overseeing water utilities, the Comision Nacional del Agua (CNA) regulating water at the national level and the Sistema de Aguas regulating water in the nation�s capital, Mexico City.
Not only is water availability a major issue in Mexico, but so is water quality. Water pollution from a variety of sources � from mining, industry, sewage, agricultural waste, among many others � has created numerous health problems, such as fatal cases of diarrhea. The problem has not been alleviated by receiving water from the U.S. Mexico has an agreement with the United States whereby Mexico gives the U.S. 350,000 acre feet of water from Rio Grande tributaries while the U.S. gives Mexico 1.5 million acre feet from the Colorado River. However,
the water reaching Mexico is polluted by U.S. agricultural run off: fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste. Water consequently has become a political issue with both foreign and domestic implications. In fact, the Mexican government has declared water quality a national security issue, and its desire to be seen as trying to address the problem has led it to host the 2006 World Water Summit, the first time the Summit has been held in the America continent.
Natural gas is not piped directly into homes, but is delivered by trucks that regularly tour neighborhoods, often daily, ringing �gas bells� (or using a loudspeaker) to notify residents of their arrival. The price of gas is set by the federal government, and has increased substantially over the last few years. The reason for this is that gas production has failed to keep up with domestic consumption. In 2004, natural gas production was 47.3 billion cubic meters, while consumption was 55.1 billion cubic meters, resulting in the importation of 7.85 billion cubic meters.
