This season the youth department at the Coral Windows Stadium will once again be running a special raffle during league home matches to help raise funds for Bantams youngsters.
After commissions are paid, 50% of the remaining prize fund will be allocated to the club's youth development.
The second half of the fund will be paid out as prize money.
This season there will also be two winners each match now instead of just one. There will be set second prize of £50, the balance being the first prize.
The 50/50 raffle is sponsored by SMF Print - http://www.smfprint.com/.
The second draw of the season took place during the half time interval of the Sheffield United fixture this Saturday (24 August 2013).
To claim one of the above prizes supporters are asked to please ring the football club on 0871 978 1911 for more information.
