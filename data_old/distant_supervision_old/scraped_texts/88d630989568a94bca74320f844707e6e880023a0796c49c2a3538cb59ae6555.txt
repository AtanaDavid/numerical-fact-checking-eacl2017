Starting in March of 2013, the National Collegiate Wrestling Championships and Convention will be held in Allen, Texas at Allen Event Center.  The National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) will hold both the 2013 and the 2014 Convention and Wrestling Championships in Allen.
“We are excited that the National Collegiate Wrestling Association has chosen Allen to hold their upcoming convention and championship competition,” said Karen Cromwell, Allen Convention and Visitors Bureau tourism manager. “The state-of-the-art Allen Event Center is the perfect venue for this event and its convenient location in the Village at Allen creates a perfect destination for visiting athletes and their families.”
The National Collegiate Wrestling Championships and Convention attracts some of the best college athletes in the country from over 160 major universities like Iowa State, Harvard and the University of Georgia to smaller colleges like Marion Military, William & Mary and Vanderbilt. In February, 462 male and 108 female athletes will qualify to make the trip to nationals culled from seven conference championships held in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida, Texas, Michigan, California and Washington in February.
