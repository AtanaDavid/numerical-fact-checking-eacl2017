"Located in Southeastern Arizona, Cross Spear Marble, Inc. (CSM)
is located near the Chiricaua National Monument and the Fort Bowie
National  Historic Site on privately owned ranch. The working cattle
ranch has been  in operation since the 1880's. The quarry spans over
50 acres and contains  five distinct veins of various colored marble
and limestone. Once the  marble and limestone are extracted from the
quarry, CSM is capable of  producing various sizes of rock for multiple
customer needs.
"The Cross Spear Mine is an excellent deposit of marble and marbleized
limestone along the western foothills of the historic Chiricahua mountains
of southeastern Arizona.
"The deposit is extensive and contains several colors. It is
on  land owned by the Riggs family, long time ranchers in Willcox,
Arizona.
"In the days when Apache Indians roamed the area, it is said
that  the famed Apache Chief, Cochise, stood on a mountain just above
where  the mine is located, noted the two canyons below crossed and
he said they  resembled a "cross spear." The mining venture
took its name  from this and became Cross Spear Marble, Inc.
"The deposit is mined by simple open pit methods. The marble
is  crushed and then sized with screens. Sizes range from boulders
to nearly  sand, depending upon what the customer wants. Several colors
are available:  white, natural red, gray, green, and black.
"A principle application of Cross Spear Marble products is stone
for decorative landscaping. Another application is for compacted road
surfacing. Future products include marble slabs, tile, terrazzo, and
other  high-end marble applications."
