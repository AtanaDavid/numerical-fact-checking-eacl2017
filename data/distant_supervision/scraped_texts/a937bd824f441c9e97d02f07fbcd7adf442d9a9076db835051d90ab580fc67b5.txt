After hitting a record low number of just 37 cases of measles in 2004, we seemed to be on a path to hit new record highs for measles every few years. That was especially true in 2014, when there were at least 667 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. - the most since 1994.
With a large outbreak in California, 2015 got off to a very strong start.
Most concerning, more and more, cases don't seem to have an source that is easy to find, which could mean that the endemic spread of measles has returned in the United States.
So instead of having to travel out of the country or be exposed to someone who got measles with a link to international travel, you could get measles just by going to a ball game, a movie theater, or to Disneyland. That makes it more important than ever to learn how to avoid measles.
Among the 189 measles cases and outbreaks in 2015 were:
In addition to these large outbreaks, 2015 also saw a number of quarantines for unvaccinated students, closing of daycare centers, and a recommendation from a California Department of Health state epidemiologist that people who are not vaccinated against measles "avoid visiting Disney" and "crowded places with a high concentration of international travelers, such as airports."
Other measles cases in 2015 include:
All together, 189 people from 24 states and the District of Columbia ended up with measles in 2015.
And there was one death, an immunocompromised women who got caught up in the Clallam County outbreak.
