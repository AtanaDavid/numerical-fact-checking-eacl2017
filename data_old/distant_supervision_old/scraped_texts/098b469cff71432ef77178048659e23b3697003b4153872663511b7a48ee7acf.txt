Tip From Seve 
Mark Carey
Seve Ballesteros has always been a hero of mine, and I can remember watching him give a short-game clinic in which he talked about a feel that he liked to cultivate in his right hand.
Seve said that he imagined the palm of his right hand was the clubface, and he used that visualisation to help him conjure every shot imaginable around the green.
When you next practise, try this for yourself.
Hit a few shots with your right hand only on the club, and feel the way the clubface works through impact.
