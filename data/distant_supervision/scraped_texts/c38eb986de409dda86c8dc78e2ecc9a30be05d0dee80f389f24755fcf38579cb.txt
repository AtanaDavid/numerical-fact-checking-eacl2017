The education secretary also defended the accusation that May and the government had no mandate for the reforms as they did not form part of the Conservative manifesto at the last election.
On Sunday, May said there was no need for her to call a general election after replacing David Cameron as prime minister as she would be “continuing the manifesto on which the Conservative government was elected”.
Shadow cabinet minister John Ashworth this morning said the Conservative government had “no mandate for writing off children’s as failures with grammars”.
Labour has attacked the new plans. But there is also opposition to the shake-up of education, which includes a relaxation of the rules on how faith schools can select their pupils, on the Tory benches.
Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the Commons Health Committee, said she would vote against the proposals as it was “completely wrong” to be “bringing in segregation by the religion of the children’s parents”.
She told Today May, who has spoken about reducing inequality, was in danger of “giving one message but introducing policies that go in the opposite direction”.
May will unveil her education plans at a speech in central-London today.
