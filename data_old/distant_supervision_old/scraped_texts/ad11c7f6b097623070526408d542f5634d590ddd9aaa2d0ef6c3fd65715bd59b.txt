Even before the first lutz, twizzle or spiral at these Olympics, figure skating has itself a trans-Atlantic spat.
A former American judge, Joe Inman, has sent e-mails to current judges urging them to mark scores more accurately when it comes to presentation - including the transitions between jumps and spins. This was considered something of a slap at European skaters Evgeny Plushenko of Russia and Brian Joubert of France, who have been viewed in the past as skaters more concerned with leaps than with steps and edges between jumps.
"It just proves that the North American lobby is on its way," Didier Gailhaguet, president of the French skating federation, told L'Equipe.
Inman insists he did not mean to target any specific skaters, but was just trying to reach out to judges who once attended his seminars on scoring.
