Ipswich’s Luke Chambers reacts: “The game was played at a good pace, it showed how much it means to us. We’re taking something up the road, it’s all the play for. We’ll be looking forward to next week”
Norwich’s Jonny Howson, who hands the man of the match award to Chambers in a dose of fair play, says: “It was going to be tight, obviously they were the home side. Both teams were going for it. Obviously we’re a bit disappointed to concede before half-time but it’s set up nicely. Roll on next Saturday.”
Indeed. This time next week we’ll do it all again. The first half was terrific, the second period was a bit dull but, ultimately, we’re no closer to figuring out who will make it to Wembley. Thanks for reading. Paul Doyle’s match report will be live soon. Bye!
