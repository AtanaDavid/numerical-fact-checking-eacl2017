A bit quiet on here. Who will we release and who should we sign, any thoughts?

Out of the loaned players Pudil, Lopez and Hunt should be targets but the others either didn't play or impress enough. Players like Melo and McGugan who aren't first choice should maybe go. Sorry to say but Nuhiu isn't good enough in my opinion. Wallace, whilst I like him, only had a year contract - I think ad Carlos might want a younger option. 
WE need at least 1 CB, 2 midfield and a CF.

Hunt has already been signed perminant back in January. Fingers crossed pudil will sign be nice to keep him build around the solid squad from last season. Keep Wallace for experience but sign both LM and RM so bannan can stay centre new LM fighting foristieri or matias so we can put foristieri CF The new RM I wouldn't keep sougou in al honesty so a younger RM to learn from Wallace. Nuhiu got a new 3 year contract so he'll be an asset still creating space for fessi and hooper I recon we need a fast striker too play some through balls from space created hooper lacked pace against hull while they had Diame ripping us apart. So definitely a Pacey striker. Joao needs some nurturing maybe a loan out? New CB and another sting CM all TALL players too we abit on the short front in midfield. Another reason hull was stronger I recon.

So yehrrr a CB CM RM LM CF I recon that would do us nicely :D.

Can you be a bit more specific please?

So I think we are fine for stokers and just need to adapt quicker to a new tactic in a game unlike against hull where we didn't turn their defence. Joao could have but didn't get long enough or the right type of ball through.
IMO we need a young CB and keep Sasso
Sign Pudil and the kid from villa
We need two wingers/ wide midfield for options - mcgeady didn't work. 
We also need a back up to bannans creativity and passing as I think it's clear when he's not there we miss him. I don't think Lopez is the answer but I would sign him as I don't feel we saw the best of him yet.

So retained list revealed but no mention of Wallace?
08 Jun 2016 19:12:30
For me, we need to find the best pairing for Keiron Lee in the centre of the park, as he was fantastic all season long. 
We need a few fast wingers and as mentioned a young centre half, but he has to be good enough to replace Loovens. 
However, I am certain that Carlos will have his plans in order, especially considering the quality he brought in last season.
