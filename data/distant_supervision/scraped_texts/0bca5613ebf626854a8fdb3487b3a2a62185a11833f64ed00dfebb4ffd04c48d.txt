Israel is a magnificent Middle Eastern country with rich history, culture and religious monuments, which is also blessed with a soft Mediterranean climate. Israel is not only a cultural and religious destination, but a great place for a beach vacation, a medical trip, or a sanatorium stay. Despite what mass media may lead you to believe, Israel is a generally safe place to go, especially if you are heading to the Mediterranean region – to Jerusalem, Haifa, Caesarea.
Jerusalem is one of the most ancient cities in the world and is of particular religious significance to Christians, Jews and Muslims. A political and cultural capital of Israel, Jerusalem attracts millions of pilgrims and cultural tourists annually thanks to its incredible number of shrines and sacred places.
Adepts of beach vacations should visit Haifa where the cleanest Mediterranean beaches are complemented by affordable apartment rentals. Haifa is also famous for Rambam Health Care Campus, one of the largest hospitals of Israel that offers highest quality treatments and the most advanced medical technologies.
South of Haifa, near the ancient Roman ruins of Caesarea Maritima, lies the newly developed town of Caesarea, whose main sights include the Ralli museum housing several works by Salvador Dalí and a golf course, the oldest in Israel. Caesarea is also famous for its luxury villas that are increasingly popular among tourists.
Israel attracts visitors to its sanatoriums on the shores of the Dead Sea – the saltiest body of water on Earth, whose waters and mineral-rich mud have healing and invigorating properties.
