Mindboggling costs published last week by the Swedish Public Health Authority show the magnitude of future financial consequences of antibiotics resistance.
The lowest estimate, based on maintaining antibiotic resistance at todayâ€™s levels, will cost 500 million USD in 2024 among other reasons due to more expensive medicines and longer treatment periods.
Should resistance levels however rise, for example to the level that Italy has today, the extra bill come in just over 3 bil...lion USD!
