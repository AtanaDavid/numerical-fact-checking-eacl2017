BRDC British Formula 3 runner-up Ricky Collard is to test for Carlin's F3 European Championship team at Snetterton as he gears up for a targeted move to the series for 2017.
The 20-year-old son of British Touring Car Championship title contender Rob Collard will test the Euro F3-spec Dallara-Volkswagen on Wednesday at Snetterton.
"I just want to keep learning and stay with Carlin if I can," said BMW junior team member Collard.
"Being a local guy, and a British driver in a British team, it would be great if I could take what I've learned this year to the FIA F3 European Championship with Carlin next year - we'll see what we can do to try and make that happen."
Although Carlin - which missed last weekend's Euro F3 round at the Nurburgring and will also skip the next event at Imola - is planning to return for the Hockenheim finale with an all-new line-up, it is understood that Collard's focus is more on 2017.
Collard has tested a current-spec F3 chassis before, in the winter of 2014-15 with Double R Racing, but it was powered by the older-generation engine.
LEIST 'LONG SHOT' FOR EURO F3
Brazilian Matheus Leist, who beat Collard to the BRDC British F3 title, is unlikely to graduate to the F3 European Championship.
Anthony 'Boyo' Hieatt, whose Double R Racing team ran Leist this season, told Autosport: "I'm still trying to get him to do Euro F3 with us but it's a long shot.
"F3 is not out of the equation, but it's not as attractive to drivers as it once was.
"I know the FIA are trying, but he doesn't want to be on a 17-car grid - he's looking at GP2, GP3 or Indy Lights as his next target.
"But maybe Macau [where Double R plans to run Alexander Sims and Dan Ticktum] can change that if we go and get a good result."
Leist did contest a one-off Euro F3 round in 2015, when he stood in for the injured Nici Pohler at Double R at the Red Bull Ring.
