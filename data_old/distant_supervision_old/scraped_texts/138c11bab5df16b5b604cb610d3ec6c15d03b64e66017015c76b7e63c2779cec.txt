Additional Details: Invitation to Join Us in Brunswick!
Coaches, players, parents and soccer fans a like, come join us in Brunswick, Ohio, and participate in our Fall Classic Soccer Tournament.  Our tournament will offer that end of the season competition you have been looking for to compliment your Fall season teams� efforts and hard work.  Brunswick is a great community and extends their city�s hospitality to you.  Last year, we were the largest soccer tournament in North East Ohio for the second year in a row with 240 teams participating.
The 2009 Brunswick Classic Soccer Tournament is approved by Ohio Youth Soccer Association North (OYSAN) and is open to all classic, league, premier and tournament teams affiliated with USSF.  Teams from outside Ohio North must have approved permission to travel from their state association along with emergency medical forms.  Other USSF-affiliated teams, especially those from US Club Soccer, are welcomed to participate, but must bring proof of insurance from USCS, AYSO, SAY or their USSF-affiliated organization.  All participating teams will be required to supply coaches and player passes, a copy of their league approved roster and medical release forms.  Foreign teams are not accepted.
Our Classic Tournament will be of the traditional youth tournament format.  The number of divisions per age group will be based on amount of teams participating.  U8 and U9 teams will play 4 games, U10 and older 3 games.  Games are two 25 minute halves.  Teams will earn 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and no points (0) for a loss.  Teams with the most points after the 3 games will advance to the championship game.  Teams who are tied in points after 3 games will go through the tie breaking rules spelled out in our tournament rules to determine advancement to the championship game.  There will be 1st and 2nd place awards for every player in the competitive championship games as well as awards for the teams' coaches.  Every U9 and younger player will receive a participative award.  There is no championship round for the U8 and U9 teams.
Special note for U8 and U9 teams
Depending on the amount of U8 teams that enter, your team may be placed in an U9 division and bracketed accordingly (meaning your division will consist mostly of U8 and weaker U9 teams).  Same goes for U9 teams, your team may be placed in an U10 division and bracketed accordingly.  Your entry fees will not be affected by the tournament moving your team to an older division.  U8 and U9 teams of course have the option to request to play at an older age group.  Please contact the tournament director with any questions or concerns.
The U14/15 division is named such in the event U14 teams have U15 players on their team.  We are not planning on having full U15 aged teams playing in the U14 division.  This is basically to allow players who are not playing in high school and are playing with other U14�s.  So therefore all the U14 divisions will be named U14/U15.  Any questions or concerns on any of these explanations, please contact the tournament director.
All classic, league, premier and tournament teams are welcomed.  Teams will be placed accordingly based on their level of play.  Teams may request to be placed in a higher division with the tournament director�s approval.  The Brunswick Classic bracketing committee researches your team and places them to their appropriate skill level so we can provide the most competitive while fair tournament challenge for your team.
Entry Fees and Number of Games
The entry fees for this tournament are as follows per team:
U8 teams play 5v5 (with a keeper)	$300	(4 games)
U9 teams play 6v6			$350	(4 games)
U10 teams play 6v6			$350	(3 game minimum)
U11-U12 teams play 8v8		$375	(3 game minimum)
U13-U14/15 teams play 11v11	$400	(3 game minimum)
This is a rain or shine tournament.  In the event some games cannot be played due to unusually bad weather, refunds in the amount of 1/3 the teams' entry fee per game for each unplayed match.  The tournament director will determine if a game is to be cancelled due to poor weather conditions.  There will be NO REFUNDS for any other reason once a team has been notified of acceptance by depositing your check in the bank.  The tournament reserves the right to combine age groups and arrange divisions by format rather than age group; teams will not receive a refund of the tournament entry fee if they withdraw because they do not like the format or bracketing.  This tournament does carry a 3-game guarantee.
Youth teams properly registered with their state associations and/or USSF affiliates are eligible.  All coaches and players must have player pass and/or a copy of their league�s approved roster.  Youth rosters are limited to 18 for U13 & U14/15, 14 for U11 & U12's, 12 for U9 & U10's and 10 for U8's.  U15 players who are still in 8th grade may play with U14 teams, but no U15 players in high school are permitted.  The U15 player�s pass should be enough proof that they are indeed eligible.  Guest players are allowed.  U8 are permitted 2 guest players, U9 & U10 are permitted 3 and U11 through U14 are allowed 4.  Guest players follow the same eligibility rules as the participating players.  Teams must present medical authorization or releases at registration for all players.  Guest players must be from the same USSF affiliate as the team to which they are requesting to guest play with.  Please see the Tournament Rules on guest players so there are no misunderstandings on their eligibility.
Your team's game schedule will be posted on our website at least one week prior to the tournament.  Monitor the website for that schedule.  Based on the amount of teams entered will determine how many fields we require, size and format along with the times we will start in the morning.  Each team is expected to be ready to play at any time on either day, Saturday and Sunday.  So make every effort to have your players here the night before if you are traveling a far distance.  We will do our best to accommodate special requests but again, we cannot promise your game schedules will permit you to drive in that morning.
Special Note for Coaches (Please Read)
It is very important that you as coaches have your coaches' passes prior to coming to our tournament.  Those coaches' passes must be with your team representative who is registering the team the night before the start of the tournament.  Only a registered, carded coach can be on the sidelines with their respective team coaching, no one else in permitted to coach the team.  Also, we stress and encourage all teams to have at least 2 coaches per team in the event one of your coaches is unavailable and cannot coach a particular game or that weekend.  We have done our best to accommodate scheduling requests but we cannot promise your game schedules will fit your personal schedule.  Also, in the event as a coach you coach more than one team entered in the tournament and your teams are scheduled to play at times which make it difficult for you to be in 2 places at once, an assistant or extra coach would solve that problem.  In addition, in the event a coach is carded and ineligible to coach the next tournament game, an extra coach is needed here as well.  Please make every effort to consider making plans to have more than one registered and carded coach available to coach your teams.
Special Note on Guest Players (Please Read)
It is also very important that you understand the guest player rule.  A guest player (someone not on your official and current roster) can only guest for the same USSF affiliated team to which they are requesting to guest play with.  For example, an US Youth Soccer team may only have US Youth Soccer players.  An US Club team may only have US Club players.  If any players want to guest from US Club to US Youth Soccer, they can ONLY by registering with US Youth Soccer and applying for a guest player pass from US Youth Soccer.
The entry deadline must be postmarked by Friday, September 25, 2009.  Mail entries to P.O. Box 633, Brunswick, Ohio 44212, to the attention of Jeff Petrenko, Tournament Director.

This is our 5th year hosting this wonderful tournament.  Last year we had a total of 240 teams with 3 states being represented, thus making the Brunswick Classic the largest tournament in North East Ohio two years running.  Each team was appropriately bracketed.  Competition at each level, age and gender was just fabulous.  Everyone had a great time.  And we enjoyed hosting all those teams.  We had teams from as far as Michigan and Pennsylvania.  We had many teams from the Toledo area, teams from Akron, Findlay, North Royalton, Lakewood and Twinsburg just to name a few.  All the teams are listed and posted on our website for your viewing.  Again, we had a great weekend!  Please come and join us in the fun and spirit of competition here in the wonderful City of Brunswick.
