Will Finn be able to find the peace and happiness away from the celebrity life that he is so desperately looking for? Or will the past continue to haunt him? To what ends will the journalists go to get that story?
I was very excited to be receiving an advanced copy of Janice's latest novel. As a huge fan of Bagpipes and Bullshot I had high expectations for Reaching for the Stars - and I'm so thrilled to say I wasn't disappointed. Janice's style that I loved so much in the first novel continues in this book. A wonderful plot and some extremely engaging characters all bundled together in a steamy Scottish kitchen!
When I started to read the story, I thought Chef McDuff would be a horrid character.
