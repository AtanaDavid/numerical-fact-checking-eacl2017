Christian Eriksen’s agent says his player could quit Tottenham Hotspur following the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union.
Martin Schoots claimed a number of Premier League stars could move abroad following the Brexit vote in Thursday’s referendum.
‘We are underestimating the danger,’ he told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. ‘The truth is that half the Premier League players will see their work permits turned into scrap paper.
‘In a situation like this, I’d take my client away from Tottenham.’
However, Spurs fans should not be too worried about losing the 24-year-old.
While it is presently unclear how Britain’s departure from the EU will impact foreign nationals already living and working in the UK, it is highly unlikely they would be made to leave once Britain has invoked Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Furthermore Eriksen is also a regular in the Danish national team – and as such would qualify for a work permit in the same way players from countries outside the EU are presently able to play in the Premier League.
