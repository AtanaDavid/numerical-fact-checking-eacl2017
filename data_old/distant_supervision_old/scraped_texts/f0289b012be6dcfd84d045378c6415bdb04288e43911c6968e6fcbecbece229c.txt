Harry Kane has already showed a liking for derby matches in his club career and now wants to conquer the oldest rivalry in international football.
Kane returned after a seven-week lay-off to start for Tottenham against North London neighbours Arsenal and kept up his enviable scoring record in the fixture.
His nerveless equalising penalty made it five goals against the Gunners in the past four meetings and underlined his credentials as a man who thrives when the stakes are high.
