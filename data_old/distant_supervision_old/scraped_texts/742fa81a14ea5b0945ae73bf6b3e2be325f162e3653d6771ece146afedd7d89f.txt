When is the takeover? Gone very quiet.
08 Nov 2016 18:09:15
Have you forgotten that last week we were told that Fawaz had signed 'period of exclusivity' that can last between 30 and 60 days so do not expect any news for a couple of weeks.Andrewred1

I will be glad when its completed as I am sure most reds will be. I also think we need change in the the running of the club, structure and stability. PM must go if we are to avoid the drop, sorry but but record speaks for its self. Not fun at the moment!Scottthered

If we are to be taken over by the Americans, will they build a wall round the City Ground? To keep our players in or other people out?bsered
09 Nov 2016 12:24:19
. to keep the fans in during games .Bigmarkred

Message to Monsieur Montanier:
It's all or nothing mate, so why not play two strikers away at Ipswich and just go for it? If you're going to get sacked, and believe me I suspect that's just round the corner, then why not go down fighting?

I would prefer if he just resigned and not wait to get fired and his pay off. His team are lacking in confidence big time. What we saw was a team steadily retreating yesterday when they couldn't get the 2nd goal. Britt was blowing out his arse by the hour mark and PM didn't make the changes quick enough.
He then goes on the radio and blames his players. Sorry he has to go and go now. So please PM, do the honourable thing and resign.KimboPaul

Regards the players if wasnt pm who got themselfs booked of his fault for hilda getting sent off bjt agree with the rest but players must take some of the blame.APS
06 Nov 2016 19:36:03
Yesterday was criminal. Goal up and a man up against the worst team I have seen this season. Take Worrall off, Velios on put Cohen and left back, Lichaj at right Hilberto through the middle with a licence to roam and go 4 4 2! Get the second goal and push on for 3 or 4. But no give them a corner a freekick and a bit of relief. Pathetic Manager!Bluebird1964
07 Nov 2016 12:05:49
Aps no it wasn't him who got them booked but it's him which keeps putting HP in defence when he clearly isn't a defender so yes I say it is his fault for getting him sent off playing him in a position he can't play in.Red James

John Jay Moores and Charles Noell seen in club shop this afternoon and then escorted by one of Fawaz's staff or family into the reception.
04 Nov 2016 22:33:55
All this gossip about takeovers and all they wanted was a little forest teddy üêª. 2tone
05 Nov 2016 09:26:12
True my son was there.Chilwellred
05 Nov 2016 10:45:36
It's true that he brought a forest teddy? 2tone
05 Nov 2016 11:06:25
Sounds like they were shoplifting? Redinexile
05 Nov 2016 13:04:35
You ought to be on the stageü§ó.Chilwellred
05 Nov 2016 17:40:49
Wrong 2 Tone! The new owners have been there for past two weeks! Fawaz was just stalling! He wanted the Forest Teddy back on loan for the rest of the season! üòÇüòÇüòÇ.Rogie Red
03 Nov 2016 19:19:55
Fawaz as just said the takeover could take up to 6 to 8 week that really lifted the spirit around the CG.
03 Nov 2016 20:30:34
Yep. So once again last nights tweets were misleading. UTF still as cocky? ! Suspect NOT!NorthNottsRed
03 Nov 2016 20:35:29
So what does he know? Most of what he has said has proved to be wrong.bsered
03 Nov 2016 21:50:53
It won't take that long he's just coming the big un.NF73FC
04 Nov 2016 07:07:05
There must be a perfectly logical fawaz reason why he tweeted all that.Herefortheforest
04 Nov 2016 07:12:27
NF73FC get ya keyboard sorted out because ya C and T aren't working properly.chopsy
04 Nov 2016 10:58:22
it's just so it looks like he helped push it through for the good of the club. he's such a hero. i'd be surprised if it's not done by the end of the international break.A Block Kev
04 Nov 2016 18:02:24
We have had due diligence, the next stage is exclusivity which can take between 30 and 60 days. This is normal practice and Fawaz cannot alter anything in the club while in this stage so no new Lansbury contract on manager sacking. Let's hope it is 30 days.Andrewred1
04 Nov 2016 20:00:32
The new owner will be pushing this through as quickly as possible. I'm sure they have plans they will want to implement immediately. Once the football league have approved the sale I think it will all move a bit quicker. Dazza60
04 Nov 2016 21:04:17
It will be done before the 3weeks that was stated. Northnottsred it's said it could take up to 6-8 weeks but it has been said it will be done before the three weeks stated. let's see who's right ; ) uptheforest
05 Nov 2016 00:34:31
Exclusivity started a while ago so expect it to be done in around 2 weeks tops.A Block Kev
02 Nov 2016 21:55:49
Fawaz saying his goodbyes on twitter. like I said must be closer than we think. Cheers northnottsred.
02 Nov 2016 22:23:00
Looks like your mate al Hasawi has done the deal. Thank God. His legacy is a broken club broken support and crap squad.NorthNottsRed
02 Nov 2016 22:43:30
And you mocked me yesterday. uptheforest
03 nov 2016 10:11:53
northnottsred who laughing now.Fish1
03 Nov 2016 10:51:39
No one. Nothing confirmed yet. Hopefully before Saturday.NorthNottsRed
01 Nov 2016 10:44:48
Takeover in final stages. completed within amonth according to ssn.
01 Nov 2016 12:49:15
Could be sooner than is being reported apparently. uptheforest
02 Nov 2016 14:25:47
How do you know? Has your mate Al Hasawi told you?NorthNottsRed
02 Nov 2016 22:06:25
You seen his latest tweets northnottsred? lol. uptheforest
31 Oct 2016 19:47:29
Lots of suggestions that hand over sale this week, on Wednesday . Dammed if l want our club called Nottingham Wednesday .
31 Oct 2016 20:18:32
Best get use to NFSC. uptheforest
31 Oct 2016 19:22:04
According to the Telegraph. Takeover to be completed in 3 weeks. We can only hope.
31 Oct 2016 16:53:15
I know someone close to Fawases advisers, everyone on his team withdrawing today and all going to London for a farewell meal takeover going to be complete by Wednesday this is happening new era dawns.
31 Oct 2016 20:37:59
Fawaz doesn't have any advisors does he? If he does they are either useless or he doesn't listen to them. If they are having a farewell meal they'd either forget to book it or turn up at the wrong place. 2tone
31 Oct 2016 20:48:12
He's treating them all to a choc bar from the machine in the Hotel, a la Geoff Boycott.bsered
31 Oct 2016 21:17:35
Could be the last supper !APS
31 Oct 2016 22:02:34
Yeah a last supper in fancy restaurant, they clear off without paying bill and we are back in court.KimboPaul
31 Oct 2016 23:57:17
He will be inviting himself in the shaving mirror to a farewell party. Redinexile
01 Nov 2016 08:43:18
So meal for one for Fawaz. jacamarUK
01 Nov 2016 09:12:48
Correct APS. and we all know who "Judas" is!Rogie Red
01 Nov 2016 17:19:17
He probably won't pay his bill.Eddiemoby
30 Oct 2016 18:28:24
never post on here I just read posts, but through circumstance I was told today that by Wednesday there will be big new re: takeover. Someone very close to the club said. So let's see #donotshootthemessenger.
30 Oct 2016 20:22:28
Thanks for the info, let's hope so! isolatedforestfan
30 Oct 2016 22:05:41
So a paper is saying we are in talks with the American and they have exclusivity period which can last 6weeks! uptheforest
31 Oct 2016 00:06:06
Cant remember where I saw it but that bit has been completed 2 or 3 weeks ago UptheForest. Dazza60
31 Oct 2016 15:47:06
Just to add to my previous post. Brad Friedel was here as part of that looking at our facilities and performing other duties on behalf of the consortium. This may all be closer than we think. Dazza60
31 Oct 2016 19:46:55
Excusivity completed. Just waiting for football league approval. Dazza60
