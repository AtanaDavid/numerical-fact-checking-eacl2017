            <p class="style1" style="margin-top: 0;">I want to celebrate what 
              must be the most notable achievement by a Brit on the international 
              scene for many years. John Slattery (Slatts) has won the European 
              Championship of Backgammon at Nova Gorica, Slovenia.<br>
              <br>
              Slatts is a flair player rather than a technical guru. He plays 
              instinctively and intuitively with a mix of psychology and a good 
              ability to tailor his plays and particularly his cubes to his opponent's 
              weaknesses. Playing to his strengths means he never plays online. 
              How could an online opponent react to his dazzling outfits and wry 
              observations? 'Did we have money on it?', he'll ask an opponent 
              chuffed to bits at having beaten him. On receipt of a negative he'll 
              riposte 'Oh, I feel like a winner now.' ... And then he'll offer 
              a rematch with a 'bit of interest'.<br>
              <br>
              I doubt Slatts has ever studied a match equity table. I've seldom 
              if ever seen him pore over an interesting position at the club. 
              And his opinion of Snowie is summed up by his offer to outplay anyone 
              for cash if they promise to follow S3's 3-ply suggestions against 
              him in a backgame. Despite (?) this he's had some successes all 
              over the world. But Slatts is famous for his character and his dress 
              sense as much as for his wins. He's one of the great bg personalities 
              and it's great that he's won this title for Scotland and for Britain.<br>
              <br>
              Could this be the start of something for the under-achieving Brits? 
              <br>
              <br>
              Just watch ....<br>
              <br>
              <em>MC:</em> John's opponent in the final of the 64 field was Rolf 
              Vetsch of Switzerland. He clinched the title in the Crawford with 
              the score 19-12. Not only did he win a great big trophy and a load 
              of dosh, but the respect of his peers, all of whom gave him a standing 
              ovation at the gala dinner and prize presentation.<br>
              <br>
              And to think, just a few years ago, he started his backgammon career 
              with Biba at the 1998 Scottish Open, reaching the dizzying heights 
              of Runner-up in the Consolation. Who'd have thought he'd be European 
              Champion five years later?<br>
              <br>
              It's about time Biba members made their mark in Europe - let's hope 
              Slats is the vanguard of British Backgammon.</p>
            <p class="style1" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Well done, Slats. Let's 
              hope it's the first of many.<br>
