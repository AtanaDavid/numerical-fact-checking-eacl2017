Miss Williams, 21, of Hartlepool, said: “My tutor Lianne Hubbart submitted my second year final project designs into the BITA awards but with so many designers across the country entering the competition I never expected anything to come of it.
“When I got the call saying that I’d come runner up I was totally overwhelmed. It’s a massive achievement for someone who is still a full time student especially as the overall competition winner was a professional design graduate.”
Inspired by graffiti art, Miss Williams’ designs, based on her favourite holiday destinations of New York and Paris, caught the eyes of the judges for their up to the minute imagery, colour and commercialism.
She added: “Part of the prize is for all the winning designs to be displayed at a range of BITA venues across the country so hundreds of people will get to see my work which is amazing.”
