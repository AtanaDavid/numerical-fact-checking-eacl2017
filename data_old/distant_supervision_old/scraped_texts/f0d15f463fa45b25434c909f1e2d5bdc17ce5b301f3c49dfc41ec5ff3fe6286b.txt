Contested at The Country Club at Soboba Springs
2008 California State Open Championship Presented by Soboba Casino
Organization: Professional Golfers Association of America, Southern California Section
Commentary:  Kyle Thurston fired a course record tying 65 in the final round to capture the title by a single shot over three other contestants.  With the victory, Kyle pocketed the $18,000 winner's share and a coveted exemption into the 2009 Soboba Classic, an Official Nationwide Tour Event to be contested on the same track in 2009.

Organization:  PGA TOUR Nationwide Tour hosted by The Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians
Commentary:  The Soboba Classic introduced the world to a bright new star when Jerod Turner tapped in for a 2 stroke victory, propelling him into the PGA TOUR Nationwide Tour's top 25 and virtually securing his PGA TOUR card for 2010.  Jerod jumped from 150th on the money list to the 17th position, guaranteeing a spot in the year end Nationwide Tour Championship.  The 133 position jump is believed to be the largest in the history of the tour and has the 34 year old Turner well within the projected money needed on the Nationwide Tour Official Money List to gain status on the PGA TOUR.  The Golf Channel coverage also introduced The Country Club at Soboba Springs to some 80 million viewers across the country, showing everyone that Major Championship golf is alive and well in the Inland Empire!
Local stars Rickie Fowler and Brendan Steele also competed and gave the large galleries plenty to cheer about.  Fowler's 65 on Friday set a course record and had him primed for a weekend run, just one shot off of the 36 hole lead.  He ended the week in a tie for 31st, and his first official money earned as a professional!  Steele, who called Soboba home during his High School golf career at local Hemet High, fared even better for the week finishing in a tie for 8th.  Steele's finish has him very close to the top 60 on the money list and coveted entry into the season ending Nationwide Tour Championship.
3rd round leader Derek Lamely fired a course record smashing 62 on Saturday, but fell just short of capturing the winner's prize of $180,000.  However, his $108,000 check moved him into 3rd position on the money list and helped sucure very high status on the PGA TOUR in 2010.
2009 California State Open Championship Presented by Soboba Casino
Organization:  Professional Golfers Association of America, Southern California Section
Commentary:  Mark Warman fired a three round total of 7 under par to capture the 2009 California State Open and the lucrative $16,000 first place check.  Mark's final round 67 matched the low round of the day on The Country Club at Soboba Springs golf course.  Set up as a par 71 and stretching over 7100 yards, conditions were easily as difficult as those faced by the PGA TOUR Nationwide Tour players which competed in the first Soboba Classic just one month earlier.
Warman's final round included 7 birdies, 2 of which came on holes 17 and 18 to close out the round, and the victory.  SCPGA Officials were very happy with the event which was hosted by The Country Club at Soboba Soprings and sponsored by Soboba Casino for a second straight year.

Organization:  PGA TOUR Nationwide Tour hosted by The Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians
Commentary:  The 2010 Soboba Golf Classic once again provided its champion with a one way ticket to the PGA TOUR.  Steven Bowditch, having started the event in the 76th position on the official money listed, vaulted all the way to number 11 with his victory and the $180,000 winner's share of the 1 million dollar purse.  The long hitting Bowditch used the shortest club in his bag to capture the second Soboba Golf Classic title needing only 96 putts to manage the difficult and fast greens at The Country Club at Soboba Springs.  Those 96 putts were 1 shy of the Nationwide Tour record for fewest putts in a 72 hole event.
Bowditch did manage to beat last year's winning score of -16 under par by 3 strokes, finishing the week at -19 under par 265 with rounds of 70, 64, 63, and 68.  Bowditch's 3rd round score of 63 was not the lowest of the week as that honor went to Camilo Benedetti of Spain, who despite carding a bogey, fired a 3rd round score of 62 and tied the tournament course record at the country club.  Benedetti went on to finish T-5th with 6 other players 6 shots off of the pace.
Daniel Summerhays birdied the final hole to finish alone in 2nd.  It was Summerhays' third 2nd place finish of the season, but the largest single tournament check of his career at $108,000.  He moved up to 4th on the money list and can rest easy knowing he will be on the PGA TOUR next year.  Summerhays won the 2007 Nationwide Children's Hospital Invitational but could not collect the 1st place check of $126,000 because he was still an amateur!
2010 California State Open Championship
Organization:  Professional Golfers Association of America, Southern California Section
Commentary:  Mike McCabe survived torential winds on the final day of play to win the 2010 California State Open at The Country Club at Soboba Springs.  McCabe fired a three over par 74 and finished the 3 day event at -10 under par to win by 2 strokes over Alex Aragon.  Aragon's -2 under par 69 in the final round was the only round under par and 4 clear of the next lowest score for the day as the wind blew as hard as 50 miles per hour.
McCabe can be proud of his play in the final round as it was nearly 4 shots below the average score in the final round which saw 20 of the best players in the country posting rounds in the 80's.
