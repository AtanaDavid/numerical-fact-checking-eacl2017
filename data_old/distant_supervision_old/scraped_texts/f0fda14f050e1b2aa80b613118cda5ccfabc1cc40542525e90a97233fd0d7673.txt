You are ready to sell your home or trade in your vehicle but you've been told you have to obtain a "Release of Lien" first.  Normally, you would go back to the bank or Savings and Loan and ask them to prepare a release for you.  But, where do you go if the bank or Savings and Loan has failed?
The FDIC may be able to provide you with a Release of Lien on your home, vehicle, boat or other personal property if:
A request for a Release of Lien must be made in writing and must detail exactly what you want.
Mail or fax your request to the DRR Customer Service Center with the recorded document to be released or to be assigned showing the closed institution as the lien holder. Also, a proof of payoff must be provided to expedite the completion of your request and avoid researching the records of the closed institution which will delay the completion of your request.
Please allow 20 business days for the completion of your request.
Please include your e-mail address and telephone number for us to communicate with you in case we need more information to complete your request.
Due to the Privacy Act of 1974, the FDIC will not accept a copy of the borrower’s credit report as proof of payoff.  PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WHEN SUBMITTING YOUR REQUEST.
