During the 2010 to 2011 spring term, staff and parents at Stockport Grammar School were delighted by the findings of a report by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI).
The ISI concluded that in the senior school, “The pupils’ overall achievement and their learning, attitudes and skills are outstanding.”
There was also high praise for the personal development of pupils and the provision for extracurricular involvement, both of which were found to be outstanding. Pupils in the senior school were described as “exceptionally well educated”.
The ISI concluded that in the junior school, the Early Years Foundation Stage (nursery and reception classes) was outstanding for overall effectiveness, quality of provision and outcomes for children.
The ISI recognised the continuation of high standards throughout the junior school, describing “the quality of the pupils’ achievements and of their learning, attitudes and skills” as excellent. They gave the same high rating to curricular and extracurricular experiences and to the development of the pupils’ personal qualities.
The ISI is the body approved by the government for the purpose of inspecting schools belonging to the Independent Schools Council.
Stockport Grammar School was visited during the spring term as part of its regular programme of inspections.
The ISI is generally recognised as being even more rigorous in its standards than Ofsted, as it sets as its benchmark standards of achievement which might be attained by the most highly selective schools in the maintained and independent sectors. Its judgements are based on a set scale in which excellent and good are the highest grades and the vocabulary used throughout the report reflects this.
