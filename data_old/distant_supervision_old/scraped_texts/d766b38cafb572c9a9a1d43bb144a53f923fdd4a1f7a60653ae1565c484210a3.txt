Rafael Nadal holding Australian Open '09 Title
This is a list of the main career statistics of professional tennis player Rafael Nadal.
Nadal captured four straight French Open singles titles from 2005 to 2008, joining Björn Borg in 2008 as the only other man to have won four consecutive singles titles there. In 2008, Nadal became the second Spanish man to win Wimbledon. Nadal is only the third male player in the open era to have won the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, and the first since Borg in 1980. In 2009, Nadal became the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open.
Nadal has been especially successful on clay courts. He has a 25–2 record in clay court tournament finals and a 48–1 record in best-of-five-set matches on clay. He won four consecutive French Open titles from 2005–2008 and has won two of the three clay court Masters Series tournaments every year since 2005. He also owns the longest single-surface winning streak in the open era, having won 81 consecutive matches on clay from April 2005 to May 2007. As a result, some tennis critics and top players already regard him as the greatest clay-court player of all time.
To prevent confusion and double counting, information in this table is updated only once a tournament or the player's participation in the tournament has concluded. This table is current through the 2009 Wimbledon in London.
