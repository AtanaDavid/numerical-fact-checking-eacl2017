Nature Sticks can be used for meditations, releasing old patterns and emotions, connecting to your higher self for information and guidance, and for bringing in peaceful and calming frequencies and energies when you need or desire them. When they are activated, the Angels and the Nature Beings step in to assist in us in connecting with our own Divine essence allowing us to “lightening up” as we let go of the old and bring in the new.
I want to thank you again for my nature stick.
The nature stick is wonderful.   I use it in meditation and it immediately connects me with my divine source’s energy.  It is very powerful.   I am very thankful that you followed your path in creating these and making them accessible to others.  I would recommend them to anyone that is on a spiritual journey – they are full of wonderful energy.

Presentation and Book Signing at Bolts of Love, Erie, PA.
Presentation with book signing to follow:
This presentation will be shortly after the release of my new book, "Rays of Light” - Listen to the Dark. My presentation will include information that is shared in the book.  The "Rays of Light" are more than just bringing in the frequencies for the cleansing, healing, balancing, and the re-alignment your bodies. The frequencies of the rays also teach you about truth and remembrance and bring in information unique for each of you.  In addition to sharing information about the rays, I will also be sharing the frequencies of the "Rays of Light" during the presentation, and teaching how they can be accessed by all, as they are available for everyone.

Holistic health expo in North Olmsted brings metaphysical enlightenment
Linda Street of Healing from Your Heart offered metaphysical services based on rays of light.
Roy Lewis of White Hawk Jewelry in Elyria brought stones and other items he indicated would foster healing, prosperity, tranquility and growth. Organic, all-natural Dharmadog biscuits were sold by another vendor, while Healing from Your Heart entrepreneur Linda Street of Westlake offered Rays of Light healing, an approach derived from 13 light rays with differing colors and frequencies. They assist in balancing one’s chakras, she asserted, and elicit healing from within.
