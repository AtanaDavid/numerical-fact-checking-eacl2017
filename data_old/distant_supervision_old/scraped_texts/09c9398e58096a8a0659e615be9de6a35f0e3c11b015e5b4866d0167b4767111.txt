The Open Championship visits the Home of Golf this week with an opportunity for a historic run to continue. Jordan Spieth, who won Sunday at the John Deere Classic, is seeking his third consecutive major victory. His victories at the Masters and the U.S. Open give him an opportunity to become the first player to win the Grand Slam in a single season.
There isn't a better venue to chase an unprecedented feat. The Old Course is a special venue, one where the history is palpable as the Old Grey Town borders the linksland. Here is a look at some groups to keep an eye on at The Open Championship (Note: all times local; all tee times begin on No. 1):
Ernie Els, Tom Watson, Brandt Snedeker: Watson will be the main attraction, as the five-time Open Championship winner will be making his final appearance in this tournament. Watson is a friend and mentor to Snedeker. Els is a two-time Open Championship winner. Tee times: 8:33 a.m. on Thursday; 1:34 p.m. on Friday.
Ian Poulter, Charl Schwartzel, Bubba Watson: Two Masters champions, Schwartzel and Watson, are paired with one of England's leading players in Poulter, who was runner-up at the 2008 Open Championship and finished third in 2013. Tee times: 9 a.m. on Thursday; 2:01 p.m. on Friday.
Sergio Garcia, Lee Westwood, Patrick Reed: There is a bit of a Ryder Cup rivalry in this group, as well as three players who are seeking their first major championship. Garcia and Westwood are stalwarts on the European team, while Reed famously shushed the crowd at Gleneagles last year. Garcia is a two-time Open runner-up (2007, 2014). Westwood has three top-three finishes at The Open, including a second-place finish at the 2010 Open at St. Andrews. Reed missed the cut last year in his Open Championship debut. Tee times: 9:11 a.m. on Thursday; 2:12 p.m. on Friday.
Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth: Spieth will be the center of attention this week. He has won four times in 2015, including two majors. His most recent victory came Sunday at the John Deere Classic. Johnson was runner-up to Spieth at this year's U.S. Open. Matsuyama finished sixth in his Open Championship debut in 2013. Matsuyama has finished in the top 25 in 10 of his past 11 PGA TOUR starts, including a fifth-place finish at the Masters and T18 at the U.S. Open. Tee times: 9:33 a.m. on Thursday; 2:34 p.m. on Friday.
Tiger Woods, Louis Oosthuizen, Jason Day: The winners of the last three Open Championships at St. Andrews are represented in this group. Woods won here in 2000 and 2005, while Oosthuizen was victorious in 2010. They also played together for the first two rounds of the U.S. Open at Chambers Bay, where Oosthuizen finished second despite a first-round 77. Day finished T9 at Chambers Bay while struggling with a viral infection. Tee times: 9:55 a.m. on Thursday; 2:56 p.m. on Friday.
Adam Scott, Martin Kaymer, Jimmy Walker: This group features two major champions and a player who has won five times in the past two PGA TOUR seasons. Scott nearly won the 2012 Open Championship, but made bogey on the final four holes to lose to Ernie Els. That loss preceded Scott's victory in the 2013 Masters. Scott has finished in the top five in the past three Open Championships. Kaymer owns two majors (2010 PGA, 2014 U.S. Open) and the 2014 PLAYERS Championship. Walker is making his third Open Championship appearance; he finished T26 last year. Tee times: 2:12 p.m. on Thursday; 9:11 a.m. on Friday.
Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Henrik Stenson: Mickelson, the 2013 Open winner, is paired with two players seeking their first majors. Kuchar finished second at last week's Scottish Open, while Stenson finished third in the 2010 Open at St. Andrews. He has two third-place finishes and a runner-up at The Open. Tee times: 2:34 p.m. on Thursday; 9:33 a.m. on Friday.
Sir Nick Faldo, Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler: Faldo, who won the 1990 Open at St. Andrews, plays with England's highest-ranked player. Fowler is among this week's favorites after winning the Scottish Open on Sunday; Fowler finished T14 at the 2010 Open at St. Andrews despite a first-round 79. Tee times: 2:45 p.m. on Thursday; 9:44 a.m. on Friday.
