The Waza Flo are an American professional arena soccer team and a member of the Major Arena Soccer League (MASL). The team's nickname, "Waza", is both a Japanese word that means "good technique" and a Swahili word meaning "to think clearly".[1][2]
The team was founded in 2008 as Detroit Waza Flo, and were a charter member of PASL-pro, the league that was an offshoot of the Professional Arena Soccer League (PASL) and would eventually be rechristened the MASL in 2014. The team had 3 homes during its 7 seasons in the Detroit area, the last 2 of which were at the Melvindale Ice Arena in suburban Melvindale, Michigan. In September 2015, the team announced it would play its home matches for the 2015-16 MASL season at the Dort Federal Credit Union Event Center in Flint, Michigan. As part of the process, the team dropped the "Detroit" from its name and logo, becoming simply Waza Flo; should they receive a welcome reception in Flint, team ownership noted it would consider adding "Flint" to the team's name.[3]
The Waza Flo also has a reserve team, Waza Premier, that plays in MASL's official development league, the Premier Arena Soccer League.
