				<h1>Our History</h1>
								<div>
<div align="center">
<p style="text-align: left;">A committee of interested golfers from around the state formed the Georgia State Golf Association in 1916 following the first Georgia Amateur Championship. According to early records, the primary purpose of founding the Association was to conduct a state amateur championship. A 14-year-old Atlantan named Bobby Jones captured that first Georgia Amateur at Capital City Club in Atlanta. The GSGA was incorporated in 1924 and was managed solely by volunteers over the next five decades. Among its milestones, the GSGA began supporting turfgrass research in 1959, rating courses in 1961, added the Junior Championship in 1966 and began administering the handicap system in 1972 before adding its first full-time staff director in 1973. The following decades saw extensive growth in members, volunteers, staff and services as the GSGA expanded its competitions program to include 18 statewide events and four interstate matches, computerized the handicap system, formalized the course rating program, established a charitable foundation, started publishing Golf Georgia magazine and began managing the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame.</p>

				<h1>Chris Haack</h1>
								<p><img height="365" src="/images/uploads/halloffame/members2/CHris_Haack.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px; border: 1px solid black;" width="250" />Christopher Jay (Chris) Haack of Bogart, Ga., is the Head Coach and Director of Golf at the University of Georgia and his outstanding leadership and dedication has annually made his program a mainstay toward the top of the collegiate golf landscape. He was the first golf coach to be inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Born in Menasha, Wis., Haack moved to Georgia and attended Newnan High School. He played golf at West Georgia College from 197801981, and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Mellen University in 1997. He began his career in golf with the American Junior Golf Association, and from 1980-1996, he held multiple positions including Tournament Director, Director of Operations, Director of Development, Foundation Director and Assistant Executive Director.</p>
<p>Haack was named head golf coach at the University of Georgia in 1996 and has taken the program to a new level of success. He has guided the Bulldogs to two national championships (the only two in school history), seven Southeastern Conference (SEC) titles and several team and individual records. His first Georgia squad in the 1997-1997 season showed glimpses of what was to come as he led the team to finish fourth or better in seven of 11 competitions and advanced to the regionals of the NCAA Championship. Haack's breakthrough year came in 1998-1999 when his Bulldog team ascended to a number one ranking in multiple national polls, and later validated the ranking by winning the program's first national championship. Haack was named National Coach of the Year that season.</p>

<p><span>Billie Wickliffe was an outstanding golfer and a great contributor to the game in Georgia, a leader who had a long-range positive impact on women&rsquo;s golf in our state, and for these virtues she is named to the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame.</span><br /><br /><span>The Georgia Women&rsquo;s Golf Association record book shows that Wickliffe won its &ldquo;official&rdquo; state championship three times, in 1966 and 1967 at Match Play and 1971 at stroke play. She also won a second tournament that was conducted during many of those years, a &ldquo;medal play&rdquo; tournament in 1964 and 1970, and while those where not considered the official &ldquo;championship,&rdquo; the fields were reportedly just as strong and the players were trying just as hard to win. So, she won a statewide competition among the best women golfers in the state five times.</span><br /><br /><span>But while her golf was among the best in her day, she was clearly instrumental in taking the GWGA to newer and more fertile ground and gave up her championship play to do so. From 1976 to 1987, she led an organized effort that would form a new organization, GALGA, that allowed all women golfers to play in a statewide competition. Upon the GWGA&rsquo;s change of membership criteria, she encouraged GALGA to disband since all players could then play in GWGA events.</span><br /><br /><span>Wickliffe was a past president of both GWGA and GALGA at different times. She also served as a course rater for the Northeast section for the GSGA. In 1994, GWGA accorded her its highest honor, honorary life membership, and posthumously renamed the Medalist Trophy, given during its championship to the player with the lowest qualifying score after 36 holes, as the Billie Wickliffe Memorial Trophy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Sauers was born in 1962 in Savannah and attended Benedictine and Johnson High Schools. As a junior, he was runner-up to Georgia Golf Hall of Famer Peter Persons in the 1980 Georgia Junior Championship and was a member of the Georgia team that included Persons, Davis Love III and Hugh Royer III in that year&rsquo;s Georgia-South Carolina-Florida Junior Challenge Match.</p>
<p>Sauers went on to attend Alexander City (Ala.) Junior College for two years, where he finished third and fourth in the junior college national championships. He graduated from Georgia Southern University, where he won the TAAC conference title.</p>
<p>Sauers was the youngest person to earn a PGA TOUR card out of the 1984 Qualifying School and soon after won his first of three TOUR titles, the 1986 Bank of Boston Classic. He also won the 1989 Hawaiian Open and 2002 Air Canada Championship. After having the outright lead after 54 holes of the 1992 PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis, he finished tied for second, three strokes back of Nick Price.</p>
<p>In 1988, Sauers became the first PGA TOUR player to win a Nationwide Tour event, the South Carolina Classic, following a victory on the PGA TOUR. He also won the unofficial 1990 Deposit Guaranty Classic and pocketed two other second-place finishes.

<p>Peter Persons has been successful as a competitive golfer at every level of play, from junior to professional, and his accomplishments over that period of time earned him entry into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame.<br /><br />Persons became the first player to win both the Georgia Junior Championship and the Georgia Amateur Championship. He was an All-Southeastern Conference and All-American player and captain of the University of Georgia golf team and was invited to play in the 1986 Masters Tournament following a runner-up finish in the 1985 U.S. Amateur. He subsequently had a successful run on the PGA TOUR, winning one title and having three exempt seasons on the TOUR.<br /><br />Persons won the 1980 Georgia Junior by seven strokes at Houston Lake Country Club in Perry against a field that included fellow future tour players Davis Love III and Gene Sauers. His Georgia Amateur victory came in 1984 at Sheraton Savannah Resort (now Wilmington Island Club) in a sudden death playoff over Louis Brown, becoming the first to win the Amateur and Junior.<br /><br />In his college career, he was part of Georgia&rsquo;s SEC championship 1982-83 team and he finished fifth individually in the NCAA Championship. In the &lsquo;83-84 season, he set a school competitive record round in relation to par with a 9-under 63. In &lsquo;84-85, he won the SEC individual title, was fourth in the NCAA, was named first team All-SEC and second team All-American. In his senior year of &lsquo;85-86, he was elected captain of the team, won two titles, finished third individually in the NCAA and was a first team All-SEC and All-American selection. His season scoring average of 70.97 was the lowest in school history up to that point and his career average of 71.79 shares the lowest with Eric Compton.<br /><br />His 1985 runner-up finish to Sam Randolph in the U.S. Amateur at Montclair Golf Club in New Jersey was as significant for sportsmanship as the golf play. Randolph fell ill during the early stages of the match and the USGA allowed him a few minutes to recover. Persons was gracious in permitting his opponent the time to gather himself, and the match continued without further incident, with Randolph winning, 1 up.<br /><br />In his Masters experience, Persons scored 153 and missed the cut but had the fourth lowest score of the 10 amateurs to participate that year.</p>
<p>As a member of the PGA TOUR, he won the 1990 Chattanooga Classic with a 20-under-par total of 260, the lowest 72-hole total of that year. He finished 56th in earnings that year and remained an exempt player on the TOUR for the following two seasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Suzanne Jackson could be called one of Georgia golf&rsquo;s modern pioneers. She was first in line at a time when opportunities were just becoming available for young women golfers, and later she was instrumental in paving the way for women in professional golf administration. Born in 1952 in LaGrange, Ga., Jackson was the only girl playing on the boys&rsquo; golf team at LaGrange High from 1968-70. As a junior golfer, she advanced to the semifinals of the 1969 U.S. Girls&rsquo; Junior Championship and won the Burdeshaw Trophy as low junior medalist in the 1970 Georgia Women&rsquo;s Amateur. She became the first woman to receive a golf scholarship to the University of Florida, where she won three college tournaments. In 1981, she was hired as a tournament official by the LPGA and continued up the ranks to become tournament director in 1985. She was named director of tournament operations in 1991. While overseeing the rules and regulations of the growing LPGA, Jackson&rsquo;s reputation as a rules expert earned her invitations as one of the first women to serve as a rules official at the U.S. Open, the PGA Championship, and the Masters.&nbsp; In addition, she represented the LPGA as a consulting member of the USGA Rules of Golf Committee. Jackson was honored with the LPGA&rsquo;s Patty Berg Award for outstanding contributions to women&rsquo;s golf and she is a member of the University of Florida Sports Hall of Fame and National Golf Coaches Association Hall of Fame.

<p>Alfred F. &ldquo;Tup&rdquo; Holmes was an outstanding amateur golfer who made an immeasurable impact on the game by virtue of his leadership in the opening of Atlanta&rsquo;s golf courses to black citizens, which became an important step for equality in the sport.</p>
<p>He was born November 6, 1917 in East Point, Ga., graduated from Booker T. Washington High in Atlanta in 1933 and earned a degree from Tuskegee (Ala.) Institute in 1939.</p>
<p>Holmes excelled as a young amateur golfer. In college, he won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference three times. He also captured the black-only Southern Amateur title three times and was the National Negro Amateur Champion four times.</p>
<p>After having been denied the opportunity to play a round at Bobby Jones Golf Course in 1951, Holmes and his family were instrumental in obtaining the right for blacks to play golf on City of Atlanta public golf courses. They subsequently brought suit against the city and the case wound its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, whose final ruling would end segregation of the City&rsquo;s courses and eventually lead to the desegregation of all City of Atlanta public places.</p>
<p>The first ruling in the case, in Federal District Court in Atlanta, was that blacks could play on city public courses but only on certain days. The family appealed the verdict and a federal appellate court upheld the district court&rsquo;s decision. Holmes obtained assistance from Thurgood Marshall, then a Baltimore attorney who successfully argued the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, in the family&rsquo;s next appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. It struck down the original ruling by the district court, sending the case back to the original judge with instructions to end segregation on the City&rsquo;s courses.</p>
<p>On December 23, 1955, &ldquo;Tup&rdquo; Holmes, his brother, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and friends Charles T. Bell, T.D. Hawkins and E.J. Peterson played a round of golf at North Fulton Golf Course, thus legally breaking the color barrier on Atlanta&rsquo;s public golf courses.</p>
<p>Holmes passed away from cancer December 16, 1967, but his family and the City of Atlanta joined together to dedicate a golf course in his honor in 1983 -- the Alfred &ldquo;Tup&rdquo; Holmes Memorial Golf Course in Adams Park on the site of a Civil War battlefield.<br /><br />Holmes was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame and among family and friends in attendance at the ceremony was 91-year-old Charles Bell, a member of the 1955 ground-breaking fivesome.<a href="http://gghof.com/sites/courses/custom.asp?id=1010&amp;page=59391"><br /></a></p>
