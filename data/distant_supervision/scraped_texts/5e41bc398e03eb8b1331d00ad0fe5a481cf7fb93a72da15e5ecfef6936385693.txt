Guns permit and enhance action that’s faster than the speed of thought.
Like that kid JHARP mentions – big argument, hot tempers, a shotgun is within reach – BOOM. (Whaddaya think of THAT, Mom?) There are fewer suicides using methods that require more time and planning, and take longer to act, than just grabbing the convenient, EZ-to-reach, not to mention LOADED, firearm.
Ditto for other conditions of impaired judgement: drunkenness, anger, fear, jealousy – the Quick&E-Z gun solution beats out considered thought, maturity, and working through the consequences of taking this particular lethal action. Just draw and squeeze. Repeat until problem is solved, just like in the movies. (That’s why those big magazines and semi-automatic fire are so desired…)
While the big killings get the most news, there are plenty of onesie and twosie shootings going on CONSTANTLY. Most appear to be the result of impaired judgement plus guns. These people aren’t wackos. They’re not alkies or druggies. Just regular folks having a bad day – and with the aid of Mr. Berretta or Mr. Smith&Wesson or whatever, making it indescribably worse.
