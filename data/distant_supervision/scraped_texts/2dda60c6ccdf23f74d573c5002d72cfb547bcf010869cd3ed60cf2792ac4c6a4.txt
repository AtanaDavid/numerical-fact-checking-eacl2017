Manchester Islamic Educational Trust was established in 1992 by a few Muslims living in Manchester with the specific purpose of “advancement of education, and more particularly, Islamic education in the United Kingdom”.
Two schools were established in quick succession: Manchester Muslim Preparatory School and Manchester Islamic High School for Girls. In 1999 a boy’s school was established in Didsbury under the name of Avicenna Grammar School for Boys and in 2000 the boy’s school moved to larger premises, Hartley Hall, in Whalley Range area of Manchester and changed its name to KD Grammar School for Boys.
In 2010 the Trust utilised some of the vacant rooms in Hartley Hall and refurbished them at considerable cost to bring them in line with Health and Safety as well as House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) guidelines, for the occupation of these rooms by university students. With Allah SWT’s Grace this project is doing well.
Alhamdulillah all this has been done with the help of the Muslim community within the country and to a large part from outside the country. The trustees of Manchester Islamic Educational Trust seek the help and guidance of Allah in continuing this mission. They hope and pray that the community, within and without, will continue to provide the support as it has done in past. May Allah SWT make it easy for all of us.
