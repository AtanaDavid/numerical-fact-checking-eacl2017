Someone stopped by searching for “gun crime england vs us.”
Well, before I answer that let me point out the simple fact that England’s Prime Minister, David Cameron, has said that only one Brit in 50 has access to a gun. At the same time, almost eight out of ten Americans have a gun in their home, and Americans own enough guns to arm every American from the newly born to the eldest centenarian twice over.
A comparison of gun crime between the two nations is a foregone conclusion. England would be a runaway winner in that contest. But at the same time, the presence of firearms in civilian hands is the single most potent inhibitor for crime and violent crime.
Comparing the crime rates between the two countries using numbers given in the Home Office’s National Crime Survey (pdf) and the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report we find:
Overall Crime, all ages, both sexes, per 100,000 population; FBI 3,295.0 vs NCS aged 10 plus, 36,500
Violent crime, all ages, both sexes, per 100,000 population; FBI 386.3 vs NCS 4,156.6
Robbery, all ages for the FBI; Adult for the NCS: FBI 113.7 vs NCS 143.7
Forcible Rape: (see page 61 forward of the National Crime Survey
Report linked above for the derivation of this rate):  FBI all ages 26.8 vs NCS 16-59 YOA 85.5 (or probably 600 and quite possibly 2,500! See box 3.2 for explanation)
Use of weapons in violent offenses: FBI (Robbery, any dangerous weapon 57.8%: Assault, any dangerous weapon 73.1%:) NCS uncategorized, any weapon, nominally 20%
Burglary; FBI 702.2 vs NCS 1405.6
Vehicle Theft; FBI 229.6 vs NCS 624.5
And the last directly comparable category; “Larceny/theft”: FBI UCR 1,976.9 VS NCR 2,035.33
Please note that all violent crime rates are taken from sources linked above. In several instances the Home Office’s NCR gives the raw totals instead of rates. When necessary, the crime numbers were converted to crime rates by dividing the given numbers by 530.013; reflecting the number of 100,000 population blocks in England’s estimated population of 53,013,000.
Unless otherwise stated (i.e. “all ages”) the NCS numbers are for adults and do not include children.
And after all that, please note that the heavily armed United States violent crime and property crime rates are far below that of “gun free and crime free paradise,” England.
