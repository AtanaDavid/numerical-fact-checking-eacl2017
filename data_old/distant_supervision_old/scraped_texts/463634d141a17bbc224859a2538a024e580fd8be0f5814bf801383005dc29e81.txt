45. Johnny Goodman is last amateur winner, 1933  The Nebraska-born insurance salesman Johnny Goodman, one of 13 children to Lithuanian immigrant parents, took the lead at North Shore, Glenview, Illinois, after a second-round 66 (including chipping in for an eagle at the 15th), and never relinquished it, despite wobbling to 76 in the final round. The American Ralph Guldahl closed to within one shot, and needed to par the last to tie – but he missed the green and dropped a shot. Goodman, who had been seven adrift of the Edinburgh-born golfer Tommy Armour after the first round, remains the last amateur to win any Major.
44. Sandy Lyle holes in one, 1993  Sandy Lyle won The Open Championship and the Masters, but never came close in the US Open - his best finish being 16th at Hazeltine in 1991. Two years later, at Baltusrol, however, he holed his tee-shot at the 206-yard 12th in the final round. "Actually, I damn near had two holes in one within an hour of each other in the last round. I holed out with a five-iron at the 12th to my great joy, then hit the pin at the 16th." It was an eventful tournament for Lyle, who also became the first man to reach the monster 630-yard 17th green in two.
43. Willie Anderson becomes the first four-time winner, 1905  Born in Berwick, Anderson earned a living as a golf professional in America, and won the US Open four times in five years – after lifting the title in 1901 he pulled off a unique hat-trick between 1903 and 1905. At Baltusrol in 1903 he won a play-off with David Brown, another Scot, by two shots. After success in 1904 at Glen View, in the aptly named village of Golf, in Cook County, Illinois, he completed the hat-trick at Myopia in 1905 - confidently shouting, "That's the championship!" after holing a long putt on the fourth hole in the third round. Anderson collected $200 for each of his wins: only Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus have so far equalled his haul of four US Open titles.
42. Sam Snead makes the cut at 61, 1973  'Slammin' Sam' became the oldest man to beat the cut in the US Open at Oakmont in 1973, when he was 61, and eventually finished in a tie for 29th place. However, despite Snead's remarkable record on the American Tour - he won 82 events, more than anyone else - he was jinxed at the US Open, which he never won despite 12 top-10 finishes. In 1939, at Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, Snead needed just a par five at the last to win, but took eight; at St Louis, Missouri, in 1947 he missed a two-footer in the closing stages of a play-off he eventually lost by a stroke. Jack Nicklaus (who won 73 tour events) beat the cut in 1998 when he was 58.
41. First-round leader misses the cut, 1993  Three men scorched round Baltusrol in 66 at the start in 1993: Australia's Craig Parry, and the American's Scott Hoch and Joey Sindelar. But Sindelar was anything but safe in the second round, stumbling to a 79 and missing the cut (foreshadowing the fate of Australia's Rod Pampling at the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie). Parry and Hoch lasted rather better, but still finished five and six shots respectively behind the eventual winner, Lee Janzen.
40. Ken Venturi crowns comeback with win, 1964  Venturi was best known for blowing a big lead at the Masters in 1956, when still an amateur, and just missed out at Augusta in 1958 and 1960, too. After that the Californian went into a slump, made worse by back trouble, and his best days seemed behind him. At Congressional, in 1964, however, he surprised even himself by coming from behind to win, after threatening to pull out following a poor start in the qualifying rounds. Leader Tommy Jacobs collapsed to a 76 on a boiling hot final day (the following year the US Open finally abandoned the practice of everyone going round twice on the last day). Venturi, who had smoked the front nine in 30 on the way to a third-round 66, also had to overcome dehydration, but composed himself well enough to make a 70 and finished with a four-shot cushion.
39. Nicklaus cramps Crampton again, 1972  The Australian Bruce Crampton was one of the most consistent golfers of his time, but he never won a Major - mainly thanks to one man. In 1972 Crampton finished second to Jack Nicklaus at the Masters, shooting a 73 in the final round, and at Pebble Beach two months' later there was a repeat performance: Crampton was one behind going into the final round, and had a chance after Nicklaus shot a 74. But on a wild and windy final day that turned out to be one of the best scores of the day – Crampton carded a 76 and was second again.
38. Tom Kite wins at last, 1992  By 1992 the American Kite was 42, and after 16 victories on the American Tour made him its leading money-winner, was heartily sick of hearing that he was the best golfer never to have won a Major. That all changed at Pebble Beach, although for most of the tournament the likely winner was another Majorless American fortysomething, Gil Morgan, who led after each of the first three rounds. But the final day was a windy one, and Morgan was blown away by an 81. Kite holed a wedged chip on the 7th for a birdie – "the best shot of his career", he would say later – and hung on for a 72.
37. Billy Casper overhauls Arnold Palmer, 1966  Going into the last nine on the final day at The Olympic, the destiny of the 1966 US Open seemed to be cut and dried: Arnold Palmer led by seven. But Arnie, who had blitzed the front nine in 32 strokes, suddenly unravelled. The last nine holes took him 39 shots, and a brilliant round crumbled into a modest 71. Seven ahead of Casper at the turn, he bogeyed the 10th and more dropped shots, including six at the 16th, saw Casper secure a play-off, which he won by four shots, never having three-putted in any of his five rounds - winning this one by four shots.
36. Willie Smith, from Carnoustie, wins, 1899  Willie Smith, from Carnoustie, never won The Open in his native country, but he did lift the US version at Baltimore, in Maryland, in 1899, finishing 11 strokes clear of the field (a record until Tiger Woods came along). The nomadic Scot later became the professional at the Mexico City Golf Club - and survived the ransacking of the clubhouse in 1915, during the Mexican Revolution, only to die of pneumonia the following year. Alex Smith, one of Willie's four brothers, won the US Open in 1906 and 1910, the second time beating another brother, Macdonald, in a play-off.
35. Scott Simpson outbirdies Tom Watson, 1987  Watson looked set to collect yet another Major when he led into the back nine at The Olympic, in San Francisco, but the Californian Simpson put the cat among the pigeons by bitting birdies at the 14th, 15th and 16th on the home stretch to take the lead. Watson needed a 45-footer for birdie at the last to force a play-off, and came perilously close - but the ball stayed above ground, and Simpson had won his only Major.
34. Gene Sarazen wins first major, 1922  The dapper and diminutive Sarazen went on to win all four Majors, but his first one came at Skokie, in Glencoe, Illinois, in 1922, when he was just 20. A final-round 68, crowned when he took a driver for his second at the wind-lashed last hole and slammed the ball 15 feet from the pin for a birdie, propelled him from four shots back past Bobby Jones, who had a share of the lead going into the last round, but managed only a 73. This was the first US Open to charge spectators for admission.
33. Qualifier Steve Jones wins, 1996  Jones was picked as an American star of the future after winning three tour events in 1989, but a motorbike accident in 1991 kept him off the circuit for three years, and he struggled to regain his previous form afterwards. In 1996 he had to pre-qualify for the US Open at Oakland Hills, and a first-round 74 - seven off the lead – didn't look too promising. But a second-round 66 was more like it, then a 69 put him only one behind Tom Lehman going into the final day. Lehman finished with a 71 as Davis Love III bogeyed the 17th and missed a short putt at the last, allowing Jones to squeak home by a stroke from Lehman.
32. Bobby Jones wins play-off by 23 strokes, 1929  Jones, the great amateur, led by three into the last round at Winged Foot, but after sloppy sevens at the eighth and the 15th he needed a tricky 12-footer on the last to make the play-off with the Californian Al Espinosa. He rattled it in. The 36-hole play-off was rather a non-event, though: Jones went round in 72 and 69, while Espinosa stumbled from bogey to bogey, eventually finishing with 84 and 80, to lose by a colossal 23 strokes.
31. Ben Hogan's comeback win, 1950  In February 1949, Ben Hogan and his wife were almost killed when his car was in a head-on collision with a coach. Sixteen months later, a patched-up Hogan reported for duty at Merion. He had recovered from multiple fractures, but still had to bind his legs up before playing and soak them in the bath afterwards. Amazingly, he survived the 36-hole final day to reach a play-off with Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio. Refreshed overnight, he scorched round in 69 the next day and win by four clear strokes. It sounds like a movie script, and it became one: Follow the Sun, a biopic of Hogan, came out in 1951, with Glenn Ford playing the lead.
30. Olin Dutra beats dysentery, 1934  American Dutra should not have played: he had been ill for a week and had lost a stone from his admittedly large frame. He dragged himself to Merion Golf Club, in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, and was eight behind the leader, Scotland's Bobby Cruickshank, at the halfway stage. Dutra then went down with another attack of what turned out to be amoebic dysentery. But Cruickshank took a 77 in the third round, even having a stroke of luck at the 11th when his second shot bounced out of a creek onto the green, as Dutra - pepping himself up with sugar cubes - closed the gap with a 71. In the final round the new leader, Gene Sarazen, sagged to a 76, while Dutra kept it simple with a 72 to win by a shot.
29. Tony Manero beats 'Hard Luck' Cooper in 1936  John Travolta played a character called Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever, but it was character that the real-life American golfer Tony Manero showed in 1936, coming from four shots back to record a brilliant 67 in the final round to pip English-born Harry Cooper, the third-round leader, by two shots. Cooper had just lost the Masters by a stroke, too, and never did win a Major.
28. Tadd Fujikawa, 15, qualifies to play, 2006  Hawaiian schoolboy Tadd Fujikawa was only 15 years old when he qualified for the 2006 US Open at Winged Foot. Not surprisingly, he missed the cut, after rounds of 81 and 77, but among those who finished behind him were three former Major winners Mark Calcavecchia and David Toms, both of the United States, and Zimbabwe's Nick Price. The following year, at the Sony Open in Hawaii, Fujikawa became the youngest player to beat the cut in an American Tour event for 49 years. The youngest-ever player at the US Open was American Tyrell Garth, who qualified in 1941 when he was just 14.
27. Ray Floyd wins despite first-round 75, 1986  After the American Floyd shot 75 in the first round at Shinnecock Hills he was more concerned about the halfway cut than the winner's cheque, but a second-round 68 got him back in contention. He was still four shots behind Greg Norman going into the final day … but Norman blew up with a 75, Floyd carded a 66 and - the only man under par for the tournament - won by two strokes.
26. Lou Graham wins from 11 back at halfway, 1975  Scores of 74 and 72 left the American Graham 11 behind Tom Watson, the halfway leader at Medinah. But Watson slumped to a 78 in the third round, while Graham made up ground with a 68. On the final day, Jack Nicklaus seemed set for another title, but he dropped shots at each of the last three holes and ended up two behind Graham - who also dropped a shot at the 18th - and another American, John Mahaffey. Graham played steadier golf in the 18-hole play-off, taking his only Major by two shots.
25. Ray Ainsley cards a 19, 1938  The worst score recorded at any one hole in the US Open is 19, by the unfortunate Ray Ainsley at the 16th in the second round at Cherry Hills in 1938. The American hit his ball into a stream and, refusing to take a penalty drop, kept trying to chip it out. He managed eventually – holing out after dropping 15 shots to par (although, he quipped, he did kill quite a lot of fish). Not surprisingly, Ainsley missed the cut.
24. Tom Watson holes from the rough, 1982  The American Watson and Jack Nicklaus were, as so often, neck and neck going into the final holes at Pebble Beach in 1982. At the 17th, Watson looked to be in trouble, in the rough beyond the green – but broke Nicklaus's heart, and his resistance, by chipping in for a birdie to clinch the sixth of his eventual eight Major titles.
23. John Daly reaches 600-yard green in two, 1993  When the 17th at Baltusrol – the first par-five there – was lengthened, it became, at 630yards, the longest hole used for any Major championship,and in 1993, Daly, the legendary American hitter, stepped up and reached the green in two, hammering a one-iron onto the putting surface after a 325-yard drive. What fewer people remember is that the first (and only other) person to manage it that year was Scotland's own Sandy Lyle.
22. Geoff Ogilvy wins, 2006  Only one Australian (David Graham in 1981) had won the US Open before Ogilvy – a distant relative of Robert the Bruce – stepped up at Winged Foot in 2006. Phil Mickelson seemed to be in pole position after three rounds, sharing the lead with the unfancied Englishman Kenneth Ferrie. But they slipped on the final day – Mickelson to second, Ferrie to sixth – and Ogilvy hung on. He chipped in at the 17th, then parred the 18th to beat Mickelson, Colin Montgomerie and the American Jim Furyk – all of whom dropped a shot at the last – by one stroke.
21. Corey Pavin clinches the title at the last, 1995  The final hole at Shinnecock Hills, in Southampton, New York State, is a nasty 450-yard par four, and the American Pavin came to it in 1995 with a two-stroke cushion. His first shot was unpromising, but he blasted his second – a four-wood from 240 yards – close enough to ensure par and his one and only Major title.
20. Julius Boros wins a play-off, 1963  Arnold Palmer had lost in a play-off in 1962, and history repeated itself at Brookline, Massachusetts, 12 months' later on a course affected by a severe winter and lashed by high winds almost throughout. In the final round, Palmer missed a two-footer at the 17th, while Texan Jacky Cupit, the third-round leader, dropped three shots on the final two holes to sink back into a three-way American tie with the studious Boros, who compiled a steady final round of 72 to make the play-off - which he won. Boros was 43, and the oldest winner of the title since England's Ted Ray in 1920. In the third round, another American, Tommy Aaron, who went on to win the Masters in 1973, carded a 91, at one point waving a white handkerchief and asking, "Where do I surrender?".
19. John McDermott is the youngest winner, 1911  After 15 victories by expatriate Brits (and the successful visit of the famous English golfer Harry Vardon in 1900) the US Open was finally won by an American-born golfer at Chicago, in Wheaton, Illinois, in 1911. The winner, John J. McDermott Jr, was only 19 and still an amateur, and remains the youngest champion. He beat Mike Brady and George Simpson – both also American-born – in an 18-hole play-off. Just to show it was no fluke, McDermott retained his title in 1912.
18. Horace Rawlins is the first champion, 1895  The first official US Open was played on Rhode Island in 1895, as something of a sideshow to the then more prestigious US Amateur Championship. All the participants – nine professionals and one amateur – were British-born, and the winner, after four nine-hole rounds were crammed into one day, was Rawlins, who was born on the Isle of Wight, but was an assistant professional at the Newport Country Club, in Rhode Island, where the inaugural US Open was staged. Rawlins won $150 and a gold medal. The previous year Willie Dunn, a Scot, had won another event called the US Open, but Rawlins won the first tournament organised by the newly formed USGA.
17. Jack Nicklaus wins for the fourth time, 1980  Nicklaus had won at Baltusrol in 1967, and when the US Open returned there in 1980 he won again, starting with a record-equalling 63 and finishing eight under on 272, a new low for the tournament. He finished two clear of the tenacious Japanese golfer Isao Aoki, who followed three 68s with a 70, and was shaken off only when Nicklaus holed a 22-footer for birdie at the 17th. It was the fourth time Nicklaus had won the US Open, tying the record of Scottish-born Willie Anderson and the American's Bobby Jones and Ben Hogan, although the 18-year gap between Nicklaus's first and last wins is another record.
16. Greg Norman loses in play-off, 1984  Australian Greg Norman's career was littered with near-but-no-cigar moments – he was only the second player, after America's Craig Wood in the 1930s, to lose play-offs at all four Majors – and the first of them came at Winged Foot in 1984, when he scrambled into a tie for the lead with a birdie at the 17th and a 15-footer at the last. But 'Fuzzy' Zoeller, of the United States, who had seen a three-shot advantage disappear over the back nine, held on and blitzed the 18-hole play-off by no fewer than eight strokes. Norman was never on terms after dropping two shots at the second.
15. Monty misses out, 1997  There was a similar script at Congressional, in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1997: going to the 17th hole in the last round, Montgomerie was level with Els, and ahead of the American Tom Lehman, who led into the final round in 1995, 1996 and 1997 and never did win the US Open. But Monty and Els, who both had final-round 69s, were held up as the previous pairing holed out, and it affected the Scot more – he lingered over a 5ft putt and eventually missed it. Els seized his chance and won by a stroke.
14. Monty misses out (again), 1994  A second-round 65 put Scotland's Colin Montgomerie in with a big chance at Oakmont in 1994, and a steady final-round 70 put him into a tie for the lead, along with the American Loren Roberts, after Ernie Els slipped to a 73. But Monty faded to a 78 in the play-off, while Els and Roberts both carded 74s: Els hung on to win at the second extra hole.
13. Mike Brady blows five-stroke lead, 1919  Local man Mike Brady led the field by five at the end of the third round at Brae Burn, in Massachusetts, in 1919, but dissolved to an 80 in the final round, allowing his compatriot, Walter Hagen, to close the gap with a 75 and force a play-off. Brady, who lost a play-off in 1911, came off second-best again this time, too, and never did win a Major. It was not all bad news for Brady, though: the flamboyant Hagen resigned as professional at Oakland Hills after his victory, and Brady picked up the job.
12. Andy North wins again, 1985  When he won the 1978 US Open at Cherry Hills, it was a case of "Andy Who?", since the American had previously won only once on the American Tour. By 1985, North was 35, and hadn't won again – but he picked up his second major at Oakland Hills, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, despite bogeying the 9th, 10th and 11th holes in the final round. Early on the final day the Taiwanese golfer Chen Tze-Chung had looked an even more unlikely winner, but most of his four-stroke lead disappeared when he carded an eight at the fifth. North never won another tournament.
11. Lee Trevino shoots four sub-70 rounds, 1968  "SuperMex" eventually won 29 times on the American Tour, but his first win was a Major – the 1968 US Open at Oak Hill, in Rochester, New York State. Despite his unorthodox swing, the American Trevino, born to Mexican parents, was consistency itself, carding rounds of 69, 68, 69 and 69 to see off Jack Nicklaus by four, although for most of the time Trevino's main opposition had come from another American, Bert Yancey, who led after each of the first three rounds, but tailed off with a final-day 76. The only other player to manage four sub-70 rounds in the US Open is the American Lee Janzen, in winning at Baltusrol in 1993.
10. Hubert Green defies death threat to win, 1977  At Southern Hills, in Tulsa Oklahoma, Hubert Green set a new US Open record with seven successive scores of three, from holes 10 to 16, and had a clear lead at the end of the second and third rounds. The final day, though, was overshadowed by news that a death threat had been received against the American. "I know they're serious," said the woman who warned the FBI that three men were after the leader. "They showed me their guns." Green couldn't have been helped much when, at the 15th, a policeman took him to one side and told him the story. He chose to play on, joking that the call probably came from a former girlfriend. He birdied the 16th, and got down in five at the last to beat his compatriot, Lou Graham (who missed an eight-footer at the last), by a stroke.
9. Bobby Jones birdies the last to win, 1926  In winning the second of his four titles, the great American amateur Bobby Jones birdied the last at Scioto, in Columbus, Ohio, to win – the last time anyone has achieved this feat in US Open history. In a windswept final round Jones was four behind Joe Turnesa with only seven holes left, but Turnesa dropped three shots on the back nine, then birdied the 480-yard 18th to set up the possibility of a play-off. Jones needed a birdie to win, and got it, his second shot – a nerveless iron – coming to rest only about 10ft from the hole. In winning his fourth title at Interlachen, in Edina, Minnesota, four years later, Jones completed the third leg of what became known as his 'Impregnable Quadrilateral' – winning the 'grand slam' of US and British Amateur Championships and Opens in the same calendar year, 1930.
8. Johnny Miller shoots 63 to win, 1973  The 1973 US Open was one of the most open of all time: uniquely, four Americans shared the lead at the end of three rounds – Julius Boros, Jerry Heard, Arnold Palmer and John Schlee. Schlee lasted best, carding a 70, but he was pipped by a stunning display from his 26-year-old compatriot Johnny Miller, who burned up the Oakmont course with a 63. He started off with four birdies, dropped just one shot (on the par-three eighth), and needed only 29 putts. It was the lowest round in US Open history, since equalled by the Americans Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf (both in the first round in 1980) and Fiji's Vijay Singh (second round, 2003). "It was the greatest round of golf in my life by a country mile," Miller said.
7. Curtis Strange beats Nick Faldo in a play-off, 1988  England's Faldo, the reigning British Open champion, sneaked into a tie when Strange bogeyed the 17th in the final round at Brookline, but the American – on his way to becoming the first man to win a million dollars in prizemoney in a single season – won the 18-hole play-off, helped when Faldo, well known for his steady playing, uncharacteristically bogeyed three of the final four holes.
6. Arnold Palmer recovers from seven behind to win, 1960  Seven behind the American Mike Souchak at the start of the last round at Cherry Hills, Colorado, Palmer shot a 65 and beat Jack Nicklaus, then a promising 20-year-old amateur, by two. Souchak, who had led from the start, carded a 75 and finished joint third. Another American, Ben Hogan, now nearly 48, was in contention for a record fifth Open until he triple-bogeyed the 17th. In a neat pairing of old and new masters, Hogan's playing partner in the final two rounds was Nicklaus. Hogan said afterwards: "I played 36 holes today with a kid who should have won this thing by 10 strokes." He knew what he was talking about: Nicklaus would go on to win four US Opens. Despite several near-misses, Palmer never won another one.
5. Hale Irwin becomes the oldest champion, 1990  Hale Irwin was a few days past his 45th birthday when he won at Medinah, Illinois, in 1990. Contact lenses had replaced the spectacles he used when winning the first of his three US Opens, at Winged Foot, in Mamaroneck, New York State, in 1974, but the crowd at last warmed to Irwin – previously seen as a bit of a robot – when he reacted to sinking a 45ft putt at the 18th by racing around the green like a teenager, 'high-fiving' members of the gallery. That gave him a share of the lead, propelling him into a play-off with Mike Donald, his compatriot, and next day Irwin won at the 19th hole after both carded 74s. "It changed how the world looked at me," said Irwin.
4. Jack Nicklaus wins in his rookie season, 1962  Nicklaus had finished second and fourth in the previous two US Opens while still an American amateur, and in his first season as a professional the 22-year-old hit a final-round of 69 to tie the lead with his compatriot, Arnold Palmer, at Oakmont, Pennsylvania. Palmer, had just won a play-off to lift the Masters, but he was not so fortunate this time, shooting a 74, while Nicklaus hit 71. Palmer really lost it on the greens, missing sinkable putts on each of the last two holes of the final round, either one of which would have won him the title. In all, Nicklaus three-putted only once in five rounds of golf; Palmer had 10.
3. Payne Stewart wins, 1999  Stewart had achieved 10 American Tour wins, including two Majors, before the 1999 US Open. However, by the time he got to Pinehurst, North Carolina, in 1999, he was 42, and had won only two tournaments on American soil since the 1991 US Open. But he followed a 68 with a 69, and a third-round 72 left him a shot in front of Phil Mickelson going into a drizzly final day. They swapped the lead down the back nine. At the 17th, Stewart's birdie put him back in front, and a 20-footer for par at the last clinched the title. Stewart was the sixth-oldest winner of the US Open. Four months later, his win gained dreadful added poignancy when he was killed in an air crash after his light aircraft depressurised.
2. Tony Jacklin becomes the last British winner, 1970  Jacklin, the reigning Open champion, won at Hazeltine, in Chaska, Minnesota, leading from wire to wire (the fourth and last player to do this). Recent alterations, which featured many dog-leg holes and blind shots over hill-brows coupled with blustery winds made the course especially difficult to play. But Jacklin was remarkably serene, following a first-round 71 with three straight 70s to win by seven, increasing his lead after each round. Victory was all but assured at the ninth in the final round, when Jacklin got himself out of trouble, but then hit his 25ft putt far too hard. It hit the back of the hole, shot up in the air…and plopped back into the cup. No British - or even European - golfer has won since.
1. Tiger Woods wins by 15 strokes, 2000  The Tiger mauled the field in the 100th US Open, leading by 10 strokes after the third round at Pebble Beach, California, with the American eventually winning by 15 strokes – a record for any Major – beating the old mark of 13 achieved by Scotlan''s 'Old' Tom Morris in The Open Championship of 1862. Woods won with a 12-under-par score of 272 – both US Open records – with no one else finishing under par. This was the first leg of the 'Tiger Slam', with Woods adding The Open and the US PGA later in the year, and then lifting the US Masters early in 2001, to hold all four Major championships at the same time.
