Education in the Philippines is given an utmost importance by the government.  In fact, it is considered an investment in the family as children are obliged to attend school at an early age. An average Filipino usually spends 10 years in basic education â€“ 6 for primary and 4 for secondary.  But with the introduction of K-12 program in 2012, another two years is added to basic education before a student proceeds to college.
As much as education is given a priority, there is still shortage of teachers especially in the primary education with only 5 teachers per 1000 students or 1:200.
