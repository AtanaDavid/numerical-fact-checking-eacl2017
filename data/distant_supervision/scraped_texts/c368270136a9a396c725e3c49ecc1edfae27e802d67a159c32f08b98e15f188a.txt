The rate of abortions in the United States in 1994 was the lowest reported since 1976. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has tracked abortions since 1972, reported that in 1994 21 of every 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 had an abortion. In 1976 there were 312 abortions per 1,000 live births; in 1994 there were 321 abortions per 1,000 births in the U.S. The Center did not cite causes for the apparent decline, but other groups have stated that the causes include: an increase of women between the ages of 35 and 44 who are less fertile; increased availability and effectiveness of birth control, resulting in fewer unwanted pregnancies; and reduced access to abortions.
