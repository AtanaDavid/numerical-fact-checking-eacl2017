Frank "Sandy" Tatum is one of the major figures in the USGA's history. That includes serving on the executive committee from 1972-80, and serving as USGA president from 1978-80.
In 1974, Tatum was the chairman of the championship committee. And that year's U.S. Open has gone down in history as "The Massacre at Winged Foot."
The winning score, by Hale Irwin, was 287 - 7-over par. And that +7 score in relation to par is the highest since 1963. Pinched fairways, crazy thick rough, severe greens. Tatum pulled out all the stops at the 1974 U.S. Open.
Some players believed it was a reaction by the USGA to Johnny Miller's final-round 63 to win at Oakmont the previous year. Tatum and the USGA always denied that. (Winged Foot is just a very tough course, after all.)
But the conditions and the scores at Winged Foot in 1974 led some golfers there to complain that the USGA was trying to embarrass them.
And that charge led to Tatum's famous retort, quoted above, which since then has become something of an unofficial credo for the USGA.
One of Tatum's successors as USGA president, David Fay, later confirmed that the USGA wants the U.S. Open to "always (be) regarded as the world's toughest golf tournament."
