The Mustangs are this season's only undefeated team in the PASL. Finishing with a 16–0 record and winning by an average of more than 9 goals per game at home and by 6 on the road, the only place the Mustangs have struggled is at the box office. Averaging just 779 fans per game, this ranks Chicago 9th in the 20-team league for average attendance.
