Wow. What a year. We've seen more killer gadgets in the Stuff office in 2014 than in an entire James Bond 23-film box-set.
Seriously. We could have come up with an incredibly strong shortlist from smartphones alone: the new, bigger iPhones, the even-better-than-last-year's-brilliant-handsets sequels such as the LG G3 and HTC One (M8), the straight-outta-nowhere shocks such as the OnePlus One and Motorola Moto X...
And then there were the first Android Wear smartwatches, a fantastic crop of Android tablets (not to mention typically superb new iPads), loads of great cameras, some amazing laptops, cars, a slew of excellent streaming TV things/streaming music things, drones, games, apps, fitness trackers, a 5K iMac and so on and on and on.
As you can imagine, whittling it all down to a 13-strong shortlist was no easy task. But surprisingly, deciding on an ultimate winner proved a bit easier - because one product impressed every single one of us here thanks to its trend-setting nature and all-round excellence. And that product is the Microsoft Surface Pro 3.
