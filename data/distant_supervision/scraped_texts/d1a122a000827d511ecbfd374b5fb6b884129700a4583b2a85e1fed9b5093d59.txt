The entrance tests will consist of two 50 minute papers, each of which assess verbal, numerical and non verbal ability.  Applicants are expected to show competence in skills appropriate to Key Stage 2 English and Mathematics, and to be able to apply these skills creatively.  These tests can only be taken once.  There are no practice papers for sale in respect of these tests.  A familiarisation sheet of questions will be available on our website.  They will be tests for which no additional preparation is necessary.
The raw scores will be age standardised.  The ranking is determined by the aggregate of the age standardised scores of both tests.  The entrance tests will take place on Saturday 16th September 2017.
There will be other schools that will be using the same tests as Reading School.  If your son takes our test after this date and is found to have taken the same test, then we will use the raw scores from the first test he took, even if it was at another school
