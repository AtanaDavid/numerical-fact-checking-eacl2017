Major Arena Soccer League (MASL) has announced the home opener games for each league team. The Chicago Mustangs will open their season on Saturday, November 8 against the 2013-14 MISL champion Missouri Comets. The game will be played at the Mustangs new home, Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates. Game time is tentatively scheduled for 7 PM.
Missouri Comets were the last team to win a MISL championship as all six clubs have now joined MASL. Established in 2010, the Comets defeated Baltimore Blast in a best-of 3 series in March to claim their first title in club history. Missouri finished the 2013-14 regular season at 14-6 before winning four of six playoff games to capture the championship.
Chicago is coming off a ‘Triple Crown’ season, winning the 2013-14 regular season title, Ron Newman Cup (playoffs) and U.S. Open Championship.
With the league expansion, MASL rules now mandate teams play in larger arenas to accommodate expected attendance increases. Sears Centre has a seating capacity of 9,400, including 1,000 club level seats and features 43 luxury suites. The Mustangs and their amateur Premier Arena Soccer League (PASL) club will continue to use Grand Sports Arena as ‘home base.”
A complete 2014-15 MASL schedule will be release in early September.
