Manchester City drew 1-1 with Southampton, a result which sees their winless run extend to five games.
City were poor in the first half and failed to take the game to Claude Puel’s side. They were slow in possession and lacked inventiveness when they had the ball. It was too easy for Saints, who went ahead through Nathan Redmond after 27 minutes.
City improved somewhat in the second half, with Kelechi Iheanacho’s introduction proving key. He equalised after a fine move involving Fernandinho and Leroy Sane – and gave City more fluidity in the final third with his ability to drop deep and link play.
But, ultimately, it proved a desperately disappointing game for City who just couldn’t find their best form.
Two more dropped points on a weekend when Arsenal and Tottenham failed to win - City will be ruing their inability to pick an average Southampton side apart.
