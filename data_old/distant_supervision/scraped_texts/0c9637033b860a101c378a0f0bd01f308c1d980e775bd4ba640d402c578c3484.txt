Predominantly sky blue, the AZ Alkmaar away jersey features black detailing in the form of a traditional polo collar and hoops on the sleeves. Subtle graphics, designed after the look of castle walls, are present inside the black stripes as a nod to the castle of Alkmaar. This is echoed by the slogan "Samen naar victorie" (together to victory) which is written on the collar.
