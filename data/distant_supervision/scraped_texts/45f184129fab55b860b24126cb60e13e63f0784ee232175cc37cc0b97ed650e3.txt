Gun homicides are considerably more common in the US than in peer countries.There were 35.5 gun homicides per million people in the US in 2013, compared to only 4.9 per million in Canada, and 0.93 per million in the UK, according to Global Burden of Disease study.

A big part of this is that the US just has many more guns per capita than any other country:
Gun ownership rates don't explain all the variation in homicide rates; lots of poor countries, particularly in Central America, have gun homicide rates many times that of the United States.
But among developed countries, both gun and overall homicide is much, much higher in the US, even after the great crime drop of the 1990s, as this chart comparing the US, Canada, and UK illustrates (other European countries also remain far lower):
