The New England Classic was a golf tournament on the PGA Tour from 1969 through 1998. It was held under various names at Pleasant Valley Country Club in Sutton, Massachusetts.
Pleasant Valley was the site of other PGA Tour and LPGA Tour events. Three LPGA Tour events, the Lady Carling Eastern Open from 1962 to 1966, the LPGA Championship from 1967 to 1968 and again from 1970 to 1972, and the Patty Berg Classic in 1969 were held at Pleasant Valley. The PGA Tour first stopped at Pleasant Valley in 1965 when "Champagne" Tony Lema won the Carling World Open, which was part of a circuit sponsored by the Carling Brewery. The inaugural Kemper Open was held at Pleasant Valley in 1968, with Arnold Palmer winning and marking the only time the men's and women's tours staged tournaments staged events on the same course in the same year until the 2014 U.S. Open and U.S. Women's Open were held at Pinehurst Number 2 in back-to-back weeks.[1] (The Kemper event moved to North Carolina the next year.)
