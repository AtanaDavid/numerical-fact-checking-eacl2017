Skegsjay said top 6 come January we be lucky to have a club come January the way things are going.
08 Nov 2016 21:29:57
If we listened to some of you we would be dead be dead and buried every season can't understand the big panic if we're in the position come January then yes but we won't be simples coyr.Skegsjay
08 Nov 2016 21:56:09
Graham think you really need to. find a new sport to follow can't remember ever seeing a remotely upbeat post from you if we finish this season in this position happy days 2 points from relegation things are bad enough all we have left is fellow fans for entertainment it is what it is just not letting it bother me now we should all be used to it it's nothing new being a forest supporter ha ha.Red James

Our last clean sheet was last season on April 16th away at Rotherham. And folk say don't panic.Darrenforest1976
09 Nov 2016 00:02:00
Our last clean sheet was when Dougie did the washing.1978

For all those keen on Joey Barton on here, it appears Rangers are letting him go, some sort of health issues. So you want Fawaz to get him? Personally I'd rather he didn't come to us as he'd only play one game in three or so after being red-carded regularly.
08 Nov 2016 22:01:23
1 yellow in 8 games at rangers.10 yellows in 40 games at burnley. his last red was feb 21st 2015,he has since played 57 games with no red. i see where your coming from on that one bsered. uptheforest

Just been reading Jack Lesters report on Pinillios, good news on the player and every time Jack puts forward his opinion l admire his comments . He is surely ear marked as our manager in the near future as we would be stupid to let him go, if and when the time comes When the taker over is done it will leave half the season left to play, that's 23 games 69 points to play for plus what we can put in the kitty now . We should need a min of 50 pts we should just about be ok .
08 Nov 2016 19:09:27
Repeating myself but said 12 months ago that Warnock and Lester should have been sorted so that at the end of this season Jack would be ready to take over having had 12 months learning. Just seen Rangers are terminating Barton's contract. Sign him up right now. Ask Sean Dyche what he was worth last season.nick26
08 Nov 2016 14:08:43
Straight answers no going into detail. Where do you think we'll finish this season. ? For me it's "relegation" cannot see no other without big big changes.
08 Nov 2016 14:15:48
Just outside relegation by a place or two. Always seem to scrape it. frozenheat
08 Nov 2016 14:42:10
Think we'll be safe enough, though it does annoy me, since we beat Leeds, we've gone in opposite directions, as my Leeds mad work mate, keeps reminding me! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤.Rogie Red
08 Nov 2016 15:25:27
Darren I think we will finish just outside the play offs ! Reason; the new owners will spend in January and they don't need to bring loads in, just the right one's. Plus a new manager is imo a certainty. We've already proved the team can turn it on so create a watertight defence and we will move on up.humourist
08 Nov 2016 17:43:50
Well I won't right off other people's news or opinions like others did to me before this mess broke publically but it's wishful thinking! Lucky to avoid relegation. Playing for every point now.Herefortheforest
08 Nov 2016 19:11:01
If PM stays we will be relegated just above Rotherham.nick26

Top 6 come end of January don't know what the panic is all about mind u it's the same every season With some of you you reds.Skegsjay
08 Nov 2016 22:10:05
Skegs the panic is not a clean sheet in nearly 7 months. Top 6 lol.Darrenforest1976
08 Nov 2016 23:00:10
Skegs I think you must live in a cave. Perhaps under the castle? Have you seen the championship? Have you seen forest? Have you seen league one? If you didn't last time this is as good as any to do so!Herefortheforest
09 Nov 2016 00:04:51
Last. Season we couldn't score goals and we was going down the the season before that we couldn't defend we was going down it gets boring were In November wait till January and then tell me we might be going down long way to go and I'm saying top 6 so remind me in January because I will be reminding you.Skegsjay

If Kenny Burns thinks that Britt will be worth 50 million I have a pint of beer that Kenny's drinking I no that Scott men can drink.

I definitely don't want anything any of them have been drinking! uptheforest
08 Nov 2016 20:01:50
Well UTF certainly not after they have been drinking it.bsered
08 Nov 2016 21:24:07
Up the forest-I'll buy you half a pint and put it in a pint glass- I guess that would be half empty for you? 2tone
08 Nov 2016 22:05:02
That would be half full to me 2tone. thanks for the offer tho but I will have to decline it. I was saying I wouldn't drink anything burns or grahamnf has been drinking ; ) uptheforest
09 Nov 2016 13:04:08
lol up the forest - i'm pretty sure you wouldn't get a chance to touch either of their drinks, I don't think the glass would stay full for very long with either of them! :) 2tone
07 Nov 2016 17:23:03
Very " encouraging " to hear PM is going to use the international break to work on a " few things " at the back! The same quotes as the last break, how many do we need to get it right! What were we " working on " because I can't see any improvement from the last time because whatever it was its back to " the drawing board ".
07 Nov 2016 20:19:24
The thing is Johnny, if we are being really honest here, our best three defenders are Hobbs, Mancienne and Pinillos. Can you remember the last time they were all injury free at the same time! The rest of our defenders are just very average. Whilst I accept PM has made mistakes in team selections, and his rotation policy, I think it's also fair to say the defenders we do have are just not good enough, and our league position is the proof of that!Murdoch

Just heard hilda out for three matches time to send him back to portttttvbbbv.APS
07 Nov 2016 20:37:02
Just heard hilda banned for 3 games time to send him on his way can't carry on like this let an acadamy player have his place and have 100 percent commitment and not play a spoilt brat who can't have his own way.APS
07 Nov 2016 21:12:52
He's the only one that has a bit of pace, . Name me another player who can run and go past players like he can? Ok, he's not the finished article, however with the right leadership, and coaching, we have a very useful winger on our hands. just needs a good kick up the a**e. just like "Robbo" needed all those years ago!Rogie Red
07 Nov 2016 21:28:13
Agree rogie with the kick up the ass and agree could be one of the best wingers in the league if we played him there every week.Skegsjay
07 Nov 2016 21:35:17
Agree mate but we need players on the pitch doing the business he his no good to us sat on his backside young players coming throu give em a chance hilda has had his should be way down the pecking order.APS
08 Nov 2016 06:31:19
He can be as quick as Usain Bolt but sat on his arse on the sidelines due to suspensions every other week is no use to us. As for the strong management of him. Bit late for that as Montanier has obviously done nothing of any note with him and when he plays him he's totally out of position at rb. Seems strange to me that only PM thinks that's where he should play? .nick26
08 Nov 2016 07:20:12
Do you think he's been told where he must play? Part of the loan agreement? 2tone
08 Nov 2016 10:58:45
From an interview with PM recently it is he who wants him to play at rb as he believes it gives him more space to run into. Call me old fashioned but isn't a full backs most important job to defend. If he wants him to have a free role then play him off the striker?nick26
08 Nov 2016 12:21:34
Bang on there nick.Red James
08 Nov 2016 14:49:09
well if that's the case all I can say is PM has some odd ideas. 2tone
08 Nov 2016 20:03:23
You mean he HAS ideas? Not seen any so far.bsered

07 Nov 2016 16:06:21
Whilst welcoming the change of ownership, allegedly JJ Mores, I can't help thinking that if true we have missed an opportunity with RB Liepzig who went equal top with Bayern at the weekend. Only promoted in the spring and look what has been achieved in the 6 months since? ! It is quoted that they are the " most hated club in Europe " but so what, it looks increasingly likely they will be in the Champins league next season. I bet they are really " losing sleep " brandishing that tag!
07 Nov 2016 17:23:43
Another fan that would give everything up for instant success.Skegsjay
07 Nov 2016 18:09:11
Skeggy It's scary that some fans still think that way isn't it? Expect other people to learn from their mistakes and then just keep their own head in the sand. 2tone
07 Nov 2016 18:31:28
Thing is boys i agree I hate this instant success thing. But look at man city they were under man utds feet for donkeys years in 1998 they were 10 mins away from staying in league 1 in play off final 2 0 down. Now they competing with the biggest clubs in the world i'm sure they don't give a flying monkeys about doing it with massive financial backing. My point is not many fans at our club like the we bought success policy but if it happened to us and in a few years we were competing in the champions league playing against sum of Europe's most elite clubs and competing for the prem title, i'm sure the majority wudnt give a rats arse because theyd be singing forests name from the roof tops. As football players and owners can be fickle the same applies to fans aswell.Rocky roo roo
07 Nov 2016 18:59:06
Rocky you wouldn't be singing forests name because red bull what he was on about taking us over for instant success would of probably changed the club's name.Skegsjay
07 Nov 2016 20:31:37
I'm not even thinking about success, promotion or the champions league-we need to sort our mess of a club out. I want to be proud of the club, not embarrassed - for years whenever I've spoke to other fans they have pretty much all said they like forest and would love to see them in the premiership, now all they say is 'your clubs in a mess-what's going on? ' Pride and stability means more to me than short term success. 2tone
07 Nov 2016 20:39:36
Red Forest. I'd live with that.2star
07 Nov 2016 20:49:08
Spot on 2tone even my fester mates feel sorry for us and that's worse than them hating us.Skegsjay
08 Nov 2016 11:40:17
It's only a missed opportunity if in fact Red Bull bid for us. Which may not be the case so it's neither here nor there.Shanghai Red
08 Nov 2016 14:35:59
Skegsjay. So4 years is instant success? ! We have seen our club become a well, respected club to being called the North Korea " of football! We were all talking about the possible change of name at the Reading game and there was 100% support for " Red Bull Forest if it got us back to the Prem! Traditionalists will see us in league 2! I bet Liepzigs fans don't give it a 2nd thought with all the success they are getting although I will say the 6 months it has taken is classed as " instant success "! But by your comments I suppose you are happy with the way things are going? ! Regarding the Leics fans who we " bumped into " in Toddinghton on the way back the only question they asked was " what is happening to your club"? ! so from your comments I take it that if the new owner was to inject money in and we miraculously got into the Prem at the end of the season you would be disappointed that it was " instant success? ! Rocky spot on mate!Johnnyv77
08 Nov 2016 14:40:44
2tone. I can assure you my head is not " in the sand "! It is usually in my hands every week watching us lose! Teams must wish they could play us every week, wouldn't be surprised if Jimmy floyd Hasselbaink wasn't warned before the game on Sat that " every body beats Forest" and when they didn't it cost him his job!Johnnyv77
08 Nov 2016 20:04:52
Mmmm, just look at what the Americans have done to Cadbury's and now to Toblerone. It might no be the picnic everyone is expecting.bsered

Well done Toby Edser great to see young talent coming through, and well done to the academy .
07 Nov 2016 16:05:44
Get him on the pitch for the 1st XI, he might be an improvement on what we've got straight away.bsered
07 Nov 2016 17:10:24
Spot on bsred He reminds me of Matty Cash in the way he surges forward at every opportunity and technically excellent for his age! When Cash is back the middle of the pitch could look quite different and it's down to one man and that's Jack Lester, surely a msnager in waiting, with us rather than somebody else!Johnnyv77
07 Nov 2016 19:42:17
I think we have missed Matty Cash since his injury, when fit he will put Kasami on the bench that's for sure. chugsy
07 Nov 2016 09:13:28
We should let philippe Montanier bring in Matt Fryatt as his assistant and make him earn some money for once. Fryatt as absolutely fleeced the club through his injury. Get well soon Matty.
07 Nov 2016 11:48:45
Blame the club and manager for signing a player with a truly awful history of injuries. Fryatt was not going to turn his chance down and I don't lay all the blame at his door. Hull have done us over twice because I count Hobbs as bad.nick26
