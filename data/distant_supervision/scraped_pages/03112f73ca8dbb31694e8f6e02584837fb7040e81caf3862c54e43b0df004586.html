                                  <p align="justify"><a href="/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a> grew out 
                                    of the ideology and practice of the <a href="/jsource/History/islamtoc.html">Islamic</a> fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood movement that arose in <a href="/jsource/arabs/egypttoc.html%20">Egypt</a> in the 1920s and it was legally registered in <a href="/jsource/israel.html">Israel</a> in 1978 by <a href="/jsource/biography/yassin.html">Sheikh Ahmed Yassin</a>, 
                                    the movement's spiritual leader, as an Islamic Association by the name 
                                    Al-Mujamma Al Islami. Initially, the organization followed the Muslim 
                                    Brotherhood's model of acting primarily as a social welfare agency that 
                                    catered especially to the <a href="/jsource/History/palreftoc.html">Palestinian 
                                      refugees</a> in the <a href="/jsource/Peace/ciagaza.html">Gaza Strip</a> and, over time, developed a good reputation for improving the lives 
                                    of Palestinians. <a href="/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a> also exerted its influence through the mosques. Today, Hamas is intimitately tied to the Islamic regimes in Syria and Iran.</p>
                                  <p align="justify">In August 1988, <a href="/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a> published the <a href="/jsource/Terrorism/Hamas_covenant.html">Islamic 
                                    Covenant</a>, which makes clear the organization is opposed to Israel's 
                                    existence in any form. It states that &quot;there is no solution for 
                                    the Palestinian question except through <i><a href="/jsource/History/jihad1.html">jihad</a></i> (holy war).&quot; The group warns that any Muslim who leaves &quot;the 
                                    circle of struggle with Zionism&quot; is guilty of &quot;high treason.&quot; <a href="/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a>' platform calls 
                                    for the creation of an Islamic republic in Palestine that would replace 
                                    Israel. Muslims should &quot;raise the banner of Allah over every inch 
                                    of Palestine,&quot; it says. </p>
                                  <p align="justify"><a href="/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a> stresses <i><a href="/jsource/History/jihad1.html">jihad</a></i> as 
                                    the sole and immediate means to solve the problem of Palestine. <a href="/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a> aims to create an Islamic state in all of Palestine. The immediate means 
                                    to achieve this goal is the escalation of the armed struggle, and ultimately <i><a href="/jsource/History/jihad1.html">jihad</a></i>, with the participation 
                                    not only of Palestinian Muslims but of the entire Islamic world. </p>

                                    violent activities are run by two central departments, which were established 
                                    before the <a href="/jsource/History/intifada.html">intifada</a>. One 
                                    is <a href="/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a>' military arm, 
                                    created in 1982 in Gaza by <a href="/jsource/biography/yassin.html">Sheikh 
                                      Ahmed Yassin</a>. In the early 1980's, the group began amassing arms 
                                    for use against Israel. After it was uncovered in 1984, <a href="/jsource/biography/yassin.html">Yassin</a> was imprisoned. He was freed as part of a 1985 prisoner exchange between 
                                    Israel and PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jibril.</p>

The peace agreement was for a proposed five year cease-fire. Hamas spokesperson <a href="/jsource/biography/marzook.html">Mousa Abu Marzouk</a> explained their rejection the next day on social media, claiming that &quot;Israel made the proposal with the aim of separating the enclave from the West Bank so it can swallow it with the settlements.

Prior to Hamas taking control of the area, Palestinian merchants used to export hundreds of tons of produce to Israel daily. Since the takeover however it has been too risky for Israel to leave the border crossings open regularly, and the blockade on Gaza has been enforced. This shipment in March 2015 included 27 tons of tomatoes and five tons of eggplants, to be sold in Israel for about $770 per ton. In the months following the end of Operation Protective Edge, Israel officials  increased the amount of border permits for Gaza merchants to sell their products in Israel. The Israeli military agency that oversees Gaza civilian affairs, COGAT, said that shipments totaling 1,500 tons are expected monthly in the future.

                                  <p align="justify">Dirar Abu Sisi, Hamas engineer and tactician, was convicted in March 2015 of opening and operating a "war college" where Hamas commanders trained, multiple counts of attempted murder, belonging to a terrorist organization, conspiracy to commit a crime, and unauthorized manufacture of arms.  Abu Sisi plead guilty to all charges levyed against him.  He was directly involved in the development of  missiles and rockets used by Hamas, including developing ways to make them shoot farther.  Because he plead guilty in court, the prosecution agreed to drop some of the many attempted murder charges.

                                  <p align="justify">A report published by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on April 21, 2015, detailed that Iran had been funneling millions of dollars to the Hamas military wing the Al-Qassam Brigades, to help them rebuild their network of terror tunnels that were destroyed during <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/protectivetoc.html">Operation Protective Edge</a>. These funds were transfered under direct orders of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the IRGC Quds force. In addition to rebuilding their network of  tunnels, Hamas members used the funds to replenish their rocket supplies.

                                  <p align="justify"><em>Foreign Policy</em> magazine reported in April 2015 that Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups were hard at work training for the next armed conflict with Israel. Women were being used more frequently by the groups according to the report: one female Hamas member was quoted  saying &#8220;We fit the training around our domestic chores.  We also watch the roads, protecting the men as they move.&#8221;  Since the end of Operation Protective Edge, more and more women in Gaza have been training to fight hand-to-hand, use firearms, disarm opponents, drive vehicles through battle-zones, and kidnap Israeli soldiers.  Abu Mujahid, a Nasser Salahuddin Brigade commander, said that &#8220;the war could start any minute. All the fighting groups evacuated the bases, we&rsquo;ve postponed training sessions, and many of the men have moved underground...  There are people right now under your feet.&#8221;

                                  <p align="justify">Hamas militants began using heavy machinery and engineering tools to build their underground attack tunnels into Israel in the begining of 2015. Witnesses from the Israeli side of the border said that they could clearly see large tractors digging and moving dirt, while underground the Hamas members used small bulldozers to maneuver in the tunnel's tight spaces. While Hamas funnels millions of dollars meant for humanitarian aid into terrorist projects, the situation of the civilians living in the Palestinian territory worsens by the day. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p align="justify">Khalil al-Haya, a senior Hamas official, encouraged Hamas members to engage in the abduction of Israeli soldiers in April 2015, stating &#8220;we tell the Zionist enemy: you are all a target for us and the resistance, we will fight you until we finally get rid of you and take as many captives as possible to free our heroes. Our men, our women, our children all envision kidnapping your soldiers and settlers, wherever they are. And it is our right because we have no other way to free our heroes, and it is the Zionist enemy responsible for this state of affairs&#8221;. He said firmly that captive Palestinian prisoners should rest assured that they will be released, and encouraged members of Palestinian resistance forces to abduct Israelis so they may be used in prisoner exchanges.

                                  <p align="justify">Palestinian Authority ministers and officials visiting the <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/gazatoc.html">Gaza Strip</a> were detained in their hotel by <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">Hamas</a> during the second week of April 2015. The group of 10 ministers and 30 government officials were sent to the Gaza Strip in order to solve the issue of Palestinian Authority employees not having been paid for months, but they were barred from leaving their hotel by Hamas militants. The Palestinian Authority members were not able to attend their important meetings scheduled during that week, and were also not able to speak to any Palestinian civilians.

                                  <p align="justify">During the weekend of April 18, senior Hamas members passed the National Solidarity Tax law on &#8220;non-basic&#8221; goods being imported into the Gaza Strip. This tax will be levied on goods such as meats, fruits, electronics, and clothing, while &#8220;necessary&#8221; goods like flour and medicine are to be exempt from the tax. Senior Hamas officials revealed that most of the revenue from this new tax would go towards paying the salaries of the over 40,000 Hamas employees who had not been paid in over a year. This tax angered Gaza merchants, who were worried that they would not be able to sell as many products if the taxes increase. The increased import tax also meant that some merchants will not be able to afford their wholesale products anymore, forcing them out of business. According to Hamas Parliament member Abu Halbiya, the tax could pile on an extra 10% in certain cases.

                                  <p align="justify">Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, a long-time target of the <a href="/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/IDFtoc.html">IDF</a> for his key role in planning terrorist attacks, who had been wounded in a prior assassination attempt, was thought  killed during <a href="/jsource/Peace/protectivetoc.html">Operation Protective Edge.</a> He resurfaced, however, months later in April 2015, reportedly overseeing a crew of approximately 1,000 workers constructing new attack tunnels with materials provided to Palestinian people for reconstruction, but  sold on the black market to Hamas. Deif is also believed to be heavily involved in plans to advance Hamas's rocket capabilities. </p>
                                  <p align="justify">The <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/hamastoc.html">military wing of Hamas</a>, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, released a video in August 2015 showing off their new tunnels which they had rebuilt following the destruction of <a href="/jsource/Peace/protectivetoc.html">Operation Protective Edge</a>. Hamas  managed to rebuild many of the terror tunnels that were destroyed by Israeli troops during the last conflict. </p>
                                  <p align="justify">Eight Hamas militants were killed on January 27, 2016, after heavy rains collapsed the terror tunnel that they were constructing. The militants were killed during the tunnel collapse and were buried in the rubble. Two more Hamas operatives were killed and eight others reported missing on February 3 in another tunnel collapse. </p>
                                  <p align="justify">The United States announced an investment of $120 million in Israel anti-tunneling technology on February 3, 2016. Later that week IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot spoke at a press conference, where he confirmed that nearly 100 engineering vehicles were currently working at the border to identify and destroy Hamas tunnels. &#8220;We are doing a lot, but many of [the things we do] are hidden from the public. We have dozens, if not a hundred, engineering vehicles on the Gaza border,&#8221; Eisenkot said. </p>
                                  <p align="justify">Three Palestinians were killed when their tunnel collapsed while digging into Israel on April 10, 2016. During the first four months of 2016 at least 16 Palestinians were killed in tunnel collapses. </p>
                                  <p align="justify">The Israeli military discovered and destroyed a tunnel going from <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/gazatoc.html">Gaza</a> into Israeli territory in mid-April 2016. This was the first completed tunnel found following <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/protectivetoc.html">Operation Protective Edge</a>. The tunnel was built approximately 110-130 feet underground, and was equipped with electricity, running water, and communication lines. The IDF discovered another cross-border tunnel from Southern Gaza into Israeli territory on May 3, 2016, and planned to &#8220;investigate it and then destroy it.&#8221; IDF officials said that they could not tell if the whole tunnel had been dug before or after Operation Protective Edge, but stated that they believed certain portions had been added more recently. </p>
                                  <p align="justify">The Israeli government announced in June 2016 that construction would soon begin on a deep underground metal wall surrounding Gaza, to prevent further tunneling. Most of the new wall will be underground, and the barrier will add to the existing border fence according to Israeli security officials. The underground barrier will stretch the entire 40-mile border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, and is expected to cost $570 million. </p>

                                <blockquote>
                                  <p>Palestinian leaders stoked the flames of violence during September and October 2015, spreading false information about Israel's actions surrounding the <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/geo/Mount.html">Temple Mount</a>. <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Abbas.html">Mahmoud Abbas</a> stated that Israelis were &ldquo;desecrating&rdquo; Muslim holy sites the al-Aksa Mosque and Church of the Holy Sepulchre with their &ldquo;filthy feet,&rdquo; and encouraged Palestinians to carry out acts of violence against Jewish Israelis. The wave of violence experienced during late 2015 was due mostly to a Palestinian perception that the Israelis were going to somehow change the rules of who could access the Temple Mount, undermining Muslim supremacy at the holy site. The Israeli government issued official statements clarifying that there was no intention of changing the status-quo at the Temple Mount, but Palestinian leaders continued to incite violence against Israeli Jews through speeches and posts on social media. Hamas leader<a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Haniyeh.html"> Ismail Haniyeh</a> declared Friday, October 9, to be a &ldquo;day of rage... a day that will represent that start of a new Intifada in all the land of Palestine.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon travelled to Israel and met with various leaders in attempts to quell the violence on October 20.
                             One hundred and eight stabbings, thirty-seven shootings, and twenty-two car-ramming attacks were carried out by Palestinians against Israelis between September 13 and January 19, 2015. To read a summary of these attacks, <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/dayofrage.html">please click here</a>. </p>
                                  <p>In response to these attacks Israeli officials ramped up security around the country, especially in Jerusalem and Hebron and at the Temple Mount. Israeli security forces also cracked down on Hamas leaders, detaining Hamas co-founder Hassan Yousef. Yousef was accused by Israel of encouraging, inciting, and praising the attacks that  rocked the country during the previous month. Hamas leaders, including Yousef, called for a new uprising against Israel and encouraged attacks on Israelis via social media and news outlets. </p>
                                  <p>The United States slashed aid to the Palestinian Authority by $80 million for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, due to the Palestinian leaders continued incitement of violence against Israelis. This represents a 22% cut from the State Department's initial budget request earlier in the year. Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen authored a Foreign Affairs Committee Resolution which was unanimously approved on October 22, 2015, calling for Abbas and other Palestinian leaders to be held accountable for the new wave of violence.  Ros-Lehtinen issued a statement calling upon Abbas to &#8220;[stop] inciting violence and promoting hatred, [and] to call for calm and work with the Israelis to restore the peace.&#8221; To read the Foreign Affairs Committee Resolution, please <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/hres293.pdf">click here</a>. </p>
                                  <p>Facebook shut down groups and pages associated with Hamas and similar organizations in late October 2015, in an effort to calm incitement being propagated through social media platforms. Hamas leaders issued a statement on October 21, confirming that, &#8220;Facebook has closed, over the past two days, a large number of pages run by and close to the Hamas movement&rsquo;s media in the occupied West Bank. Today and yesterday, [Hamas] pages [based] in Ramallah, Galilee, Nablus, Bethlehem, Qalqilya, Salfit, Tubas and Jenin were closed, as well as the page of Muslim Youth League in the West Bank. At the same time as the closure of these pages, Facebook has closed and frozen the accounts of dozens of publishers and administrators who run [them].&#8221; </p>
                                  <p>The IDF and the Shin Bet exposed a terror network of 24 militants operating in the Palestinian city of Qalqilya, West Bank, on November 9, 2015. The 24 individuals arrested represented some of the main terrorist leadership in that district, who regularly received instructions and support from Qatar and Gaza. </p>
                                  <p>Hamas transferred thousands upon thousands of dollars to the Islamic State affiliate in Sinai, Egypt during 2015. According to Israeli security officials, Hamas's military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, paid the ISIS affiliate in Sinai to secure weapons shipments, which were then smuggled in tunnels between Egypt and Gaza. Egyptian security officials blame Hamas for changing the Islamic State in Sinai from a rag-tag group of rebels, into well-armed and well-funded fighting group. This revelation is an interesting paradox, considering that the main financial sponsor of Hamas, Iran, is fighting the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. </p>
                                  <p>A report was leaked in early January 2016 that exposed an Iranian attempt to ally themselves with Hamas in their dispute with Saudi Arabia. Iran offered Hamas financial support in return, but the offer was rejected by Hamas official <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Mashal.html">Khaled Meshaal</a>. Meshaal claimed that it would be &#8220;unwise&#8221; to intervene in the dispute between Iran and Saudi Arabia. A taped phone conversation released on February 1, 2016, captured Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzouk berating Iran, claiming that the Iranian government has not provided Hamas aid since 2009. Marzouk said, &#8220;They are incredibly manipulative people. We've received nothing from them since 2009. Everything they're saying is a lie.&#8221; In response to these accusations, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hussein Ansari clarified that Iran was indeed still providing support in many ways to various Palestinian &#8220;resistance&#8221; groups, including Hamas. </p>
                                  <p>Hamas leader <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Haniyeh.html">Ismail Haniyeh</a> revealed on January 29, 2016, that the group was developing their military capabilities once more, in preparation for a protracted conflict with Israel. &#8220;There are those who think that the calm is a time of rest,&#8221; Haniyeh said, during his weekly sermon following Friday prayers, &#8220;But this is a continuation of the struggle. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades are working and preparing for Palestine.&#8221;</p>
                                  <p>Hamas representatives, headed by Abu Omar Nasser, arrived in Iran on February 10, 2016 to participate in Iranian celebrations marking the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. </p>
                                  <p>Members of the Izaddin al-Kassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, expressed outrage in mid-February 2015 at the execution of a top brigade commander, Mohamed Eshtaiwi.  Hamas executed Eshtaiwi, a senior commander of the  Izaddin al-Kassam brigades, for treason and alleged &#8220;moral and behavioral tresspasses,&#8221; after he contacted leaders of Hamas cells abroad. Members of the Al-Kassam brigades who split off and began referring to themselves as the Free al-Kassam brigades, issued statements strongly condemning Eshtaiwi's execution at the hands of Hamas. </p>
                                  <p>Reuters Bureau Chief in Israel Luke Baker was briefly detained and questioned by Hamas members while taking pictures of a new road being built in Gaza on February 25, 2016. Baker was stopped by a man in a suit as he was doing his work and was instructed to go with the man. The pair entered a building where Baker was introduced to a man who identified himself as a leader of Hamas security forces, who proceeded to questioned Baker while the two sat in a courtyard and shared drinks. The journalist was allowed to leave after a short time, and stated that he did not feel scared and was not accused of anything. </p>
                                  <p>Members of the Hamas militant group crossed the border to Egypt and began fighting along side the Islamic State in Sinai during late 2015 and early 2016, according to Egyptian officials. The Hamas members arrived in small groups, via the last secretive tunnels connecting Gaza to the Sinai. </p>
                                  <p>Israeli officials stated in March 2016 that they believed Hamas had replenished their rocket supply following <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/protectivetoc.html">Operation Protective Edge</a>. </p>
                                  <p>On April 18, 2016, a bomb placed on a public bus in <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/jerutoc.html">Jerusalem</a> exploded, injuring 21 Israelis. This was the first attack on an Israeli bus since the establishment of the <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/fence.html">Security Fence</a>. </p>
                                  <p>The Hamas terror organization carried out short-range missile tests on June 10, 2016, in an effort to improve range and accuracy of it's projectiles. Approximately 30 rockets were fired by the group, none of which were aimed at Israeli territory. </p>
                                  <p>Israeli authorities arrested Mohammad El Halabi on June 15, 2016, on charges of funneling approximately $43 million in aid to the military branches of Hamas since 2010. El Halabi was the Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of the large Christian charity organization World Vision, and had allegedly been working for Hamas since 2004. El Halabi was given a mission by Hamas to infiltrate the World Vision organization, and gain an influential position. In the 6 years that El Halabi worked for World Vision, he managed to transfer approximately 60% of the organization's budget to Hamas. In response to these revelations, both the Australian and German governments immediately suspended all funding of World Vision's projects in the Palestinian territories. </p>
                                  <p>Waheed Borsh, an 38-year old engineer who had  worked for the <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/UNDP.html">UN Development Programme (UNDP)</a> since 2003, was arrested on July 16, 2016, and charged in August with providing aid to the Hamas islamist terror movement. The suspect confessed to diverting 300 tons of rubble and cement from a UNDP program to a Hamas naval project, and encouraging UNDP inspectors to focus rebuilding efforts following <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/protectivetoc.html">Protective Edge</a> on areas where Hamas officials lived. During April and May 2015, Borsh helped build a naval commando port for Hamas. The UNDP issued a statement claiming that they were &#8220;greatly concerned&#8221; about the situation, and would conduct a &#8220;thorough internal review of the processes and circumstances surrounding the allegation.&#8221; </p>
                                  <p>The U.S State Department designated senior Hamas official Fathi Ahmad Mohammad Hammad as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, in September 2016. Hammad engaged in terrorist activity on behalf of the Hamas organization, and was in charge of security within Gaza while serving as Hamas's Interior Minister. </p>
