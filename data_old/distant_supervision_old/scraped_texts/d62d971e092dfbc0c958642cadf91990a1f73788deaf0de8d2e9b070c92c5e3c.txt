The 1972 PGA Championship was won by Gary Player, 10 years after his first win in the PGA. It was Player's sixth win in a major (he ended his career with nine major championship trophies).
The key shot for Player is described by the PGA of America's tournament history as a "miracle" 9-iron. Player, reeling with two straight bogies, reached the 16th hole of the final round and lost his drive well right on the par-4 hole. He was behind a tree and unable to see the green. But Player struck his 9-iron over the tree, across a pond, and to within four feet of the cup.
After making that birdie putt, Player went on to beat Tommy Aaron and Jim Jamieson by two strokes. Jamieson was a journeyman pro who won his only PGA Tour event earlier in the year at the Western Open. Aaron went on to win the 1973 Masters.
Sam Snead finished tied for fourth at age 60. This tournament started a three-year streak in which Snead, at ages 60, 61 and 62, finished in the Top 10 at the PGA Championship.
