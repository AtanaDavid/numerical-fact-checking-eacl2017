We needed that big time. We knew it was going to be a difficult game, and we didn’t help ourselves by conceding so early, but the guys up front created mayhem and we kept it tight at the back after the goal. We’re ecstatic.
Character was important. We’ve been thrown different obstacles this season and to lose a goal that early we could have put our heads down, but the positivity, the fight, the willingness, it was first class.
I wasn’t even sure I was going to take that free-kick. Gayley put the ball down and I said I’ll have a go, and he looked at me with bemusement. I’m just grateful we won today, because we have a bit of relief now.
