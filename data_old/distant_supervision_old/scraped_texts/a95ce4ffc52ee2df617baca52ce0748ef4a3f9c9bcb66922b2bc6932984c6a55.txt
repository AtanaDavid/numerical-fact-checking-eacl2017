We always shoot to get our opinions of all the big games up in time to help inform your day-one purchase decision. But sometimes our access to games is limited for one reason or another, and we can’t review what we can’t play.
In this case, Mafia's publisher, 2K Games, has declined our request for a pre-release copy of Mafia 3 to play ahead of time – and, in fact, does not intend to provide advance review copies to anyone. While we strongly protest this decision, review copies are submitted voluntarily and it is a publisher’s choice to make whether to do so.
Therefore, we will start our Mafia 3 review early on Thursday morning as soon as copies unlock for the public in New Zealand. Because this is a large, open-world game and we intend to give it a fair, full review treatment regardless of 2K’s decision not to cooperate, we expect we’ll need to put in quite a few hours of play before we can finalize our review. You can look for us to wrap it up sometime next week, depending on how long a game it turns out to be.
In the meantime, you can get lots of Mafia 3 information on what we’ve been shown in advance of release, including our growing Mafia 3 Wiki Guide. You can read more about IGN's review standards and practices here.
