A new study by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says that for every 1,000 births in the United States, 200 babies are aborted. The report was an analysis of information from 2011.
According to the report 730,322 women had abortions in 2011, with 333,964 of the abortions performed by Planned Parenthood doctors.
Most of the women who underwent the abortion procedure were unmarried.
The report stated, “Among the 37 areas that reported by marital status for 2011, 14.5% of all women who obtained an abortion were married and 85.5% were unmarried. The abortion ratio was 43 abortions per 1,000 live births for married women and 373 abortions per 1,000 live births for unmarried women.”
The CDC also found that women in their 20s were most likely to obtain an abortion.
“In 2011 and throughout the period of analysis, women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions and had the highest abortion rates, and women in their 30s and older accounted for a much smaller percentage of abortions and had lower abortion rates,” the CDC wrote.
Teen girls were also made up a significant portion of those seeking abortions.
“In 2011, adolescents aged … 15–19 years accounted for … 13.5% of all abortions,” the report stated, “and had abortion rates of … 10.5 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged … 15–19 years.”
“Among the 44 areas that reported age by individual year among adolescents for 2011, adolescents aged 18–19 years accounted for the majority (65.3%) of adolescent abortions and had the highest adolescent abortion rates (14.8 and 18.9 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged 18 and 19 years, respectively).”
The abortion rate is reportedly down 4 percent from 2010, when there were 228 abortions performed for every 1,000 births.
