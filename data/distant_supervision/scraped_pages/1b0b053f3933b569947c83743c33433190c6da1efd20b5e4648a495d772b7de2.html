<p>Every student has individual learning abilities. While in many cases, one of the goals of a comprehensive education is inclusion of all students of a particular age or grade level into the same classroom, at times some students’ needs are better served in a more focused setting. From early intervention through high school, teachers and parents may decide that a student would benefit from a learning experience which combines smaller classrooms and purposeful activities with trained faculty who are educated to understand a student’s particular abilities. Our website acknowledges that it is not always productive or accurate to combine a range of learning styles and needs under a single category. A child with a hearing loss does not have the same needs as a student who has been diagnosed with autism. In the future, we would like to compile separate lists to evaluate the myriad schools which exist for specific needs. But with the acknowledgment of the imperfect terms, the editors hope to begin with this list entitled 50 Best Private Special Needs Schools in the United States, with the umbrella term used basically to designate any student who has difficulty with success in an academic environment, whether because of the need for a physical accommodation, a cognitive challenge, or an emotional obstacle. Schools for students with special needs address academic, physical, social, and/or emotional issues. In this list, specific services provided by each ranked school are outlined. The editors considered both boarding and day schools for this list, and when a ranked boarding school offers day school options, it is noted.</p>
<h4>Selections were made based on the following:</h4>
<p>1. The school has a rich curriculum based on variety of offerings/tools to service its students.<br />
2. The school has a low student-teacher ratio, which is important to schools which serve all types of learning abilities, but when students struggle in more than one area, the student’s learning experience is enhanced by specialized attention from a trained teacher. Many of the schools chosen have a faculty of whom over 50% possess Master’s degrees or above.<br />
3. The school has won awards for teaching, excellence, or architecture.<br />
4. The school offers unique programs which transcend the basic academic curricula, like animal therapy, links to colleges, online learning options, sports, or art.</p>
<p>N.B. The language in this article takes its cue from the individual school’s designation. For example, if a school refers to its students as having special needs, learning disabilities (LD), learning (dis) abilities, or learning differences, our editors followed suit in that school’s write up.</p>
<p>The editors have attempted to create as geographically diverse a selection as possible while representing the schools which best fall under the methodology.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After The Vanguard School was directly hit by three hurricanes in 2004, the entire campus was renovated or rebuilt, and the school, started in 1960, re-opened with new dormitories, classrooms, administrative buildings, clinic, and a Visual and Performing Arts Center. With both boarding and day school options, Vanguard serves students aged 10 through high school, and also offers a unique post-graduate program to help students prepare for the transition between high school and either college, vocational school, or the working world. The school serves students whose struggles with Asperger’s Syndrome, dyslexia, dyscalculia, or an attention deficit affect academic progress, but it does not provide therapy to students with significant behavioral needs. Vanguard is known particularly for its competitive sports teams—students have the opportunity to play myriad sports with area schools—and for its emphasis on life preparation. Graduating students are awarded either an academic diploma if they plan to go on to college, or a practical arts diploma if their goal is to pursue a vocation or career.</p>

<p>The Hill Center helps students with learning differences and attention deficit disorders understand and accommodate their educational needs. Each student attends the Hill Center for part of his/her school day, and returns to his/her own private or public school for the rest of the day, allowing him/her to effectively transition to traditional school full time after individualized instruction is completed (usually in 3-4 years). The Hill Center provides specialists who acknowledge academic difficulties, such as spelling and math comprehension, and social struggles, such as immature behavior and trouble standing still, who teach students to understand their learning differences. While graduates of The Hill Center learn the skills to successfully integrate in a mainstream school, they have not suppressed their personalities or unique ways. Rather, they leave with a keen understanding of their own learning styles and the tools they will need to succeed in a world that doesn’t always embrace learning differences. After participating in The Hill Center’s individualized, multi-sensory instruction, students gain the self-confidence, motivation, and knowledge they will need to successfully negotiate their future education.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor Academy’s middle and high school programs work with students of average to above-average intelligence whose learning needs—autism, language-based disabilities, or attention disorders—require particular attention to certain academic subjects or personal management. While the school serves the needs of students within a particular age range, it does not assume that one’s age or grade corresponds to one’s skill set. Rather than unceremoniously distributing grades, Ann Arbor Academy analyzes students’ performance based on individual progress, and each student’s strengths and weaknesses are assessed, worked on, and discussed with parents/guardians throughout the school year. Among its many offerings, the school supports an “experiential learning” trip to Europe for upper level students, and emphasizes self-advocacy and personal organization techniques for all learners.</p>

The school’s drama group, The Woodhall Players, is known throughout the community for its production of full-length dramatic productions, and its athletic programs demand, first and foremost, adherence to a rigorous code of conduct. Students graduate from The Woodhall School prepared not only for the challenges of higher education, but confident in the competent, ethical men they have become.</p>

<p>Students come to the Chelsea School with language-based learning disabilities, struggles with math facts and problem-solving concepts, and difficulties with personal and academic organization which prevent them from completely succeeding in traditional classroom settings. Of particular note is the Chelsea School’s dedication to reading and writing as skills which span all subjects; every teacher, regardless of whether he or she is teaching English, math, history, or any course, emphasizes the importance of language and instructs in student development of those abilities. In addition to an individualized, structured curriculum, each student benefits from daily meetings with a faculty advisor and receives formal guidance in study techniques and academic discipline.</p>

The education at Noble Academy is as diverse as its students. While many students attend the school for the duration of their primary and high school education, some stay only for a year or two as they catch up on weak areas and gain the skills they need to transition to a mainstream school or college. Typically, students contact Noble Academy when they struggle with math or writing disabilities, central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), or memory problems. The school assigns an advisor to each student and ensures that she/he is appropriately accommodated and has access to direct instruction and assistive technology in a sequential, organized setting. Students have the opportunity to participate in art programs, sports, foreign language courses, and independent studies. Uniquely, the school offers an “8th period,” which is time that is set aside each day for students to discuss their educational experiences, plan activities such as community volunteering and Student Senate, and develop teamwork, personal advocacy, and problem solving skills.</p>

<p>Upon admission to Denver Academy, each student is given a complete diagnostic analysis so that a custom learning plan may be put into place. Students with dyslexia, learning difficulties, and unique learning styles benefit from a full curriculum designed to address each student’s needs based on strengths and gaps, rather than by chronological age. Small classroom groups, led by a trained teacher and teaching assistant, ensure that each student is taught according to the best way he/she learns. Each grade is taught based on scope and sequence; overall educational learning goals are defined, and then a student transitions through the program based on the successful completion of individual goals, as opposed to aligning with general grade requirements. Denver Academy not only ensures that its students are academically and socially prepared for college, but it also provides for students who have graduated high school and need extra assistance transitioning to higher education with its College Achievement Program (CAP). CAP assists students with the college application process by creating mock-admissions scenarios, and all upper-level students meet weekly with a personal advisor who helps to plan and prepare students for their next educational steps.</p>

In order to adequately prepare for college and other educational transitions, when students reach the high school level, they attend more traditionally outlined grade levels and receive letter grades.

<p>Humanex, short for “human experience,” strives to provide a specialized, supportive environment for students with learning disabilities and differences, anxiety, depression, and emotional issues which affect meaningful academic progress. Often “twice exceptional” students seek out Humanex Academy because they excel in one subject but struggle significantly in another. The school’s trained teachers are prepared to design coursework and study plans aimed toward such students with often considerably disparate skills. While the curriculum follows the Colorado Model Content Standards, teaching methods vary considerably from mainstream schools, with instructors offering auditory, visual, and kinesthetic ways of learning subjects and concepts that might otherwise present difficulty. Humanex teachers focus on the ways in which brain types affect learning. For students who are right-, left-, or “whole-brained,” classes and activities adapt to learning styles, and instruction both addresses weaknesses and encourages awareness of personal strengths.</p>

Camphill Special School, part of the Camphill educational community, whose mission is to serve students with intellectual and developmental disabilities, relies upon solid educational methods and therapeutic care. Basing its methods on the Waldorf curriculum, which ties academic learning to emotional growth, the school offers age-based courses of study alongside woodworking, dramatic arts, weaving, and other opportunities for students to discover interests and hobbies. Students in elementary and middle school are placed with one teacher for the duration of the student’s time at Camphill, and although other instructors are responsible for specialized subjects, the consistent relationship to the primary teacher becomes instrumental to significant development. The school offers physical, occupational, and artistic therapy, and emphasizes a strong community comprised of students, faculty, parents, and volunteers.</p>

<p>With a maximum enrollment of 48 students, Oxford Academy is able to provide specialized curriculum and individualized attention to students who have struggled in mainstream classrooms because of learning, attention, and emotional needs, including those who are learning English as a second language. Because the size of the school allows it to offer one-on-one classes, students at Oxford Academy benefit from the expertise of highly-trained teachers (who often live on campus) who are able to evaluate and monitor a student’s progress and customize course content and lessons. The school’s community emphasizes critical thinking, self-advocacy, and personal responsibility, and students attend to both body and mind with campus activities such as newspaper reading, foreign language study, and intermural sports, including flag football, weightlifting, and paintball.</p>

<p>At The Lab School, faculty, administration, parents, and students believe that a student who learns differently needs more than the basic accommodation provided by traditional schools. Students who struggle with learning because of dyslexia, ADHD, or other diagnoses that affect academic progress often need an individualized learning plan in order to reach full capability. Using multi-sensory teaching techniques, including art therapy, the school guides the development of its students’ conceptual and subject understanding, self-confidence, and passion for learning. At Lab, every student sets personal goals, and with the school’s support— its tutoring services, emphasis on personal responsibility, and collaboration with local businesses for student internships—those goals are often met and surpassed.</p>

<p>In 1946, Dr. Norman T. Phelps founded a school for boys whose needs require more individualized attention than traditional schools could provide. Today, the school’s motto, “dedication to the individual boy,” is applied throughout the academic community. With small classes devoted to assessing students’ skill levels and challenging each student to understand his abilities, capitalize on his strengths, and acknowledge his weaknesses, The Phelps School concentrates on developing the academic, physical, social, and moral parts of the self. A significant presence of international students broadens each boy’s awareness of worldly diversity, while a strong faculty presence (several faculty members supervise the dorms) ensures close student-teacher relationships which are conducive to learning.</p>

<p>Cumberland Academy ensures success, whether a student struggles with academic or social needs, or whether she/he has been diagnosed with high functioning autism, Asperger’s, ADHD, or other learning differences which make learning in a traditional classroom particularly difficult. Teachers and counselors work with each student to provide the most appropriate program, and while many students are taught according to grade-level standards, the school also offers its Trailblazers program, in which students of several ages gather together in a more individualized setting to work at a suitable pace. Students at all levels participate in pragmatics (social skills instruction), fine arts, athletics, overnight trips, culinary arts, and hands-on science excursions. Additionally, Cumberland offers a post-graduate program to assist young adults in applying for college, managing and paying personal bills, and networking in the world of employment.</p>

<p>As a school in which over 75% of teachers hold Master’s degrees or higher, Oakwood School promises to provide superior comprehensive education to students with learning differences who have not reached their potential in a traditional school setting. Using a team model concept in which students are assigned to a team consisting of two teachers and a group of peers, the school creates a setting for ultimate learning potential. The instructors teach both math and reading, which encourages application of concepts across the curriculum, and students have the opportunity to work with members of other groups when two teams combine for social studies and science classes. One advantage of the team approach is the system of support and close evaluation which results from working in small groups. Students at Oakwood School benefit from its technologically advanced classrooms, academic and social affective offerings, and extracurricular activities, such as fitness, theatre, art, and music clubs.</p>

<p>At The Schenck School, students who have had difficulties with reading and written expression due to dyslexia or other type of learning difference encounter trained teachers who use methods and design lessons based on individual need. Employing a pure Orton-Gillingham approach, instructors incorporate elements of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning to produce the most comprehensive curriculum possible. Depending upon a student’s level, instruction begins with emphasis on letters and sounds as a basis for teaching reading and writing. With the understanding that students of high intelligence simply learn concepts differently, teachers offer strategies such as metacognition for memory and association, and present information in a sequential manner. As knowledge is gained, students affirm and apply it through classroom practice and one-on-one tutoring. While most students spend about 2-3 years at The Schenck School, the learning strategies and self confidence gained lasts a lifetime.</p>

<p>Founded in 1930, Forman School specializes in meeting the needs of students who learn differently, whether because of dyslexia, ADHD, or executive functioning difficulties. Its comprehensive curriculum is influenced by the reading innovator, Dr. Samuel T. Orton (co-founder of the Orton-Gillingham method of reading), and by Albert Einstein, one of the school’s first board members who himself struggled with reading in school. Currently, as a college preparatory school, Forman provides for the academic needs of its students and ensures that in addition to gaining the subject knowledge that students will need to attend university, students also learn to analyze and think critically in general. Every student is required to take Thinking and Writing, a course which emphasizes how the writing process is foremost about critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. Students leave Forman with both academic skills and a better understanding of how their own needs and personalities affect their learning and progress.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the dePaul School opened as a place for students with learning differences who were not succeeding in mainstream classrooms, or whose needs were not being addressed in their educational settings. Today, the school provides a creative, individualized learning environment for students with a variety of needs, from difficulty with subjects such as reading or mathematics, to struggles with organization and time management. When students arrive at dePaul, they are provided with a Map for Success, a teaching strategy which combines multi-sensory, attention-based learning with a structured class setting and emphasis on practiced skills. Each student learns to integrate his/her education within daily life, even beyond the classroom. For example, as instructors demonstrate effective ways to process information, they help students to be aware of the times in which they lose focus, so that students learn to identify such situations and cope with them in and out of class. The dePaul School focuses on challenging its students, building upon acquired knowledge, and providing an education that attends to a student’s academic, social, behavioral, and physical needs.</p>

Summit’s students are bright and emotionally sound, but they often experience frustration with reading and other academic tasks. Once the school evaluates a student and assesses his/her specific needs, trained teachers create curricula which both challenges a student and offers structured learning at a doable pace. Summit recognizes that students with language-based learning differences are often not sufficiently helped with once-a-week tutoring, but instead require daily, intense assistance that begins with sound/letter recognition and works up to sentence structure and word function (grammar). In addition to its detailed academic program, the school offers technology instruction, including an iPad for every sixth and seventh grade student.</p>
