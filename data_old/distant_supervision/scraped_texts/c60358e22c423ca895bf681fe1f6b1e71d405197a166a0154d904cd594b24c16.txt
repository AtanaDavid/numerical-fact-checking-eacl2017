ReAct! is an inter-artistic company based in Stockholm, Sweden, that aims to reach the public directly by performing in public spaces, therefore opening art to new audiences. The inspiration for its work and attitude comes from Street Performance, Invisible Theatre, Flash Mobs, and other audience challenging performing styles… we blend these concepts into a new approach: ReAct!
Dance, movement, theatre and circus can be seen as the main artistic tools, but we go beyond them and other artistic forms are also used.
ReAct! is also an intercultural company with members originally from Sweden, Finland, France and Portugal.
Since our creation in 2011, we have developed and performed actions for public spaces such as libraries, squares, escalators and subways, and have performed in several festivals and events, mostly in Sweden but also in France, Finland, The Netherlands and Portugal.  Some of the festivals and venues we have performed in are: Stoff 2012, Move be Moved 2013, Marguerite Duras Library (Paris), Festival Sorties de Bains 2014, Flow Festival 2015 (Helsinki), Halmstad International Street Theater Festival 2015, Stockholm Subway and Stockholm Kulturhuset.
ReAct! is part of Subtopia and supported by DIS (Dans I Stockholms Stad och Län) and Konstnärsnämnden.
