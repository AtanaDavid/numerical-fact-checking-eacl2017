After only three months of training the Royal Navy Womenâ€™s Rugby League side played their first match against the Portsmouth UNI on Saturday 24th May 2008. This was the culmination of a lot of hard work from both the team and the coaching staff, LPT Jack Daniels and LPT Fred West assisted by Steve Smallbone. The result was an impressive display of commitment and enthusiasm as the Navy forced their way to a 24-0 victory over the local side. The game had three tries scored in each half (Lt Sara Collen (2), ET Emily Atkins (2), POWEA Nat Philips, AB Jenni Andrews) in a game that, although it started a bit shaky with the girls showing initial nerves, settled as they began to enjoyed the majority of the possession.
Although Portsmouth UNI had some impressive runners the girls made every effort to bring these down and stayed on top of the game very rarely being split by the opposition and never really looking as though the opposition were going to score.
Everyone present played with determination and drive leading to a very difficult decision to single out an individual player for the women of the match but a final call from the team Captain (POWEA Nat Philips) nominated ET Lou Graham as a worthy winner.
