Estonia experiences four distinct seasons with the ideal time to visit the summer months of June to August when temperatures are at their highest and the days long with light. It's at this time of year when Estonia's festivals are held. The weather in Estonia is changeable throughout the year so it could rain at any moment and the nights can get surprisingly chilly so pack for all seasons, even in the height of summer, with a rain jacket and warm jumper.
Late spring, from April to May, and early autumn, September to October, is another great time to visit when the weather is still warm and the craziness of the peak tourist season has died down a little. During these shoulder seasons Estonia's countryside is awash with colour, whether it's the vivid hues of flowers in blooms or the burning russet tones of autumnal leaves.
From November to February Estonia experiences freezing conditions as temperatures plummet and snow starts to fall. This can be a magical time to visit when the countryside is blanketed in white and the ski resorts open for the season.
