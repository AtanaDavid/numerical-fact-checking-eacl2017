Treasury bills, or T-bills, are sold in terms ranging from a few days to 52
weeks. Bills are typically sold at a discount from the par amount (also
called face value). For instance, you might pay $990 for a $1,000 bill.
When the bill matures, you would be paid $1,000. The difference between
the purchase price and face value is interest. It is possible for a bill
auction to result in a price equal to par, which means that Treasury will issue
and redeem the securities at par value.
You can buy bills from us in TreasuryDirect. You can also buy them through a bank or broker. (We no longer sell bills in Legacy Treasury Direct, which we are phasing out.)
You can hold a bill until it matures or sell it before it matures.
