number of abortions rose consistently throughout the 1970s and the
1980s.36 However,
that trend reversed during the 1990s as the number of legal
abortions declined by 17.4 percent between 1990 and 1999.37
There are a number of different reasons
for this decline. However, one factor that cannot be overlooked is
the impact of pro-life legislation in the states. By the end of the
decade, more states had adopted parental involvement requirements,
informed consent requirements, and "partial-birth abortion" bans.38 More important,
regression results provide evidence that each of these laws was
effective at reducing the number of abortions that took place.
