All in all, a very encouraging match for Louis van Gaal to ponder. Unless he goes of his own accord, I can’t see him leaving in the next few days. But don’t worry, there’s still time: Manchester United host Swansea on Saturday. Plenty of opportunity for an underwhelming performance there.
Both teams might have won this. Manchester United hit the woodwork twice and Courtois made a wonderful point-blank save in the second half, whilst Rooney could have scored a late winner. Chelsea’s best opportunities fell to Matic – who missed a one-on-one – and Terry who had a close-range header turned over the bar. De Gea also made an excellent double save to deny Pedro and then Azpilicueta.
Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Bye!
