If you’re heading to Florida on holiday in 2017, you are pretty much guaranteed gorgeous weather – it’s not called the Sunshine State for nothing. Peak season in South Florida stretches from December to April, when the so-called “snowbirds” migrate from the chilly northern states.
Disney World and the other theme parks become a merry, sweaty squish as soon as the schools are out for summer, drawing crowds that are likely to madden even the most Zen parents.
If you’re on the hunt for a cheap holiday deal to Florida, try travelling between September and November, when there are refreshingly few tourists and the heat has mellowed out after the summer. Hotel prices tumble during these months, giving you the chance to snap up a cheap Florida package deal at a fraction of the usual price.
If you’ve got designs on Disney World, you can stumble upon some great 2017 Florida holidays between January and the Easter break, when the weather is mild and most kids are at school.
