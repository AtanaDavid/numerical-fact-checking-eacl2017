Under the Davis Cup rules, this meant that for Friday’s singles, Murray played the Swiss No 2, Stan Wawrinka while Mackin played the Swiss No 1, Roger Federer. Baith o them lost thair rubbers, giein Switzerland a 2–0 lead. Under the rules, for Sunday’s reverse singles, Bates would hae been able tae substitute Mackin wi Greg Rusedski, sae that Rusedski would play Wawrinka, while Murray played Federer. Houiver, Bates believed that Federer wis virtually unbeatable acause he wis on a winnin streak an hadn’t lost syne Juin,[286] an consequently Britain gambled on beatin Wawrinka twice, wi Murray playin Wawrinka when he wis freshest. In the doubles, Murray/Rusedski played Federer an Yves Allegro, leavin Rusedski tae play anly ance.[287][288] The British tactics came tae nought as Switzerland won the doubles rubber as well, gainin un unassailable 3–0 lead efter twa the days.

Murray plays an all-court gemme wi an emphasis on defensive baseline play, an professional tennis coach Paul Annacone stated that Murray "may be the best counterpuncher on tour today."[343][344] His strengths include groondstrokes wi law error rate, the ability tae anticipate an react, an his transition frae defence tae offence wi speed, which enables him tae hit winners frae defensive poseetions. His playin style haes been likened tae that o Miloslav Mečíř. Murray an aa haes ane o the best twa-handed backhands on the tour, wi dynamic stroke execution[345] while he primarily uses his forehaund an a sliced backhaund tae let opponents play intae his haunds.[346] Tim Henman haes stated that Murray mey nou hae the best lob in the gemme, succeedin Lleyton Hewitt.[347] In addition tae this, Murray is a good volleyer, occasionally approachin the net, an executes a fine drop shot, awtho his drop shots are whiles a drawback against faster players lik Roger Federer.[348][349]

While Murray's serve is a major weapon for him, wi his first serve reachin speeds o 130 mph or higher on some occasions,[354] it whiles can be a weakness for him when hit under pressure,[355] especially wi a more inconsistent seicont serve. Syne his 2011 saison an Ivan Lendl's coaching, he haes worked tae improve his consistency, seicont serve, returns an mental gemme, resultin in a more offensive gemme.[354][356][357]
