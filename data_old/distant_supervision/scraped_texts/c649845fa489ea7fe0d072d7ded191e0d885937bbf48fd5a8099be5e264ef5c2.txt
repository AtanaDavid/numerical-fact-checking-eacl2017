Matthew Lindsay and Alison McConnell join Alasdair Mackenzie to react to Monday's Champions League and Europa League draws.
This morning Celtic learned that they will face either Gibraltar's Lincoln Red Imps or Flora Tallinn of Estonia in the Champions League second qualifying round.
The team discuss Celtic's draw on the day that the squad begin pre-season training, as Brendan Rodgers starts to shape his squad for the new campaign.
We also look at the Europa League first qualifying round draw, with Aberdeen set to play Infonet, also from Estonia, and Hearts set to faceLuxembourg's CS Fola Esch.
Finally, we touch on the ongoing fallout from Friday's release of the Premiership fixtures by the SPFL, which Partick Thistle, Motherwell and Hamilton have hit out at.
