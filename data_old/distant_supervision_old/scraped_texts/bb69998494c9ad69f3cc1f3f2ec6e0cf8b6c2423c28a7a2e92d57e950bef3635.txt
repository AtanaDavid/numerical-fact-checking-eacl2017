The Sportsplex has an in-house debit account offering a discount. You load money onto the card and your session fee is deducted when you participate in an activity. You deposit money in increments of $40.00. For every $40.00 you put on your card you are given an extra credit of $10.00â€”that amounts to a 20% bonus! You get a $50.00 value for your investment of $40.00. The in-house debit account will be under your name, so should you lose the card you can still access the funds.
The Sportsplex offers an annual membership which has benefits. Good for one year, the membership card costs $15.50.
