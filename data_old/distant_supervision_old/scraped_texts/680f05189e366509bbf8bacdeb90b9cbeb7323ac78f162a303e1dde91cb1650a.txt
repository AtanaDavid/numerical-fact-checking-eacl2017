Only a handful of men have survived golf's toughest test. Many, many more have watched the U.S. Open tournament slip through their fingers. It's almost a guarantee to happen this time around, when the 2016 U.S. Open gets going at Oakmont Country Club in western Pennsylvania on June 16. The last time the tournament was there, Angel Cabrera won it at 5-over par.
This year, Jason Day is the favorite to win the U.S. Open, followed by Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, who has struggled at times since his collapse in the Masters in April. He won the U.S. Open last year thanks to some gutsy putting in Sunday's final round.
Tiger Woods is nowhere to be found. He's won three U.S. Opens, the last in 2008 in an epic playoff over Rocco Mediate. It was his last of 14 major titles.
Here are all the other golfers to survive the U.S. Open.
