                     by a foreign person are subject to U.S. tax of 30%. A reduced rate, including exemption, may apply if there is a tax treaty
                     between the foreign person's country of residence and the United States. The tax is generally withheld (chapter 3 withholding)
                     from the payment made to the foreign person.

                  <p>The term &#8220;<span class="quote">chapter 3 withholding</span>&#8221; is used in this publication descriptively to refer to withholding required under sections 1441, 1442, and 1443 of the Internal
                     Revenue Code. In most cases, chapter 3 withholding describes the withholding regime that requires withholding on a payment
                     of U.S. source income. Payments to foreign persons, including nonresident alien individuals, foreign entities, and governments,

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Withholding is required at the time you make a payment of an amount subject to withholding. A payment is made to a
                           person if that person realizes income, whether or not there is an actual transfer of cash or other property. A payment is
                           considered made to a person if it is paid for that person's benefit. For example, a payment made to a creditor of a person
                           in satisfaction of that person's debt to the creditor is considered made to the person. A payment also is considered made
                           to a person if it is made to that person's agent.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A U.S. partnership should withhold when any distributions that include amounts subject to withholding are made. However,
                           if a foreign partner's distributive share of income subject to withholding is not actually distributed, the U.S. partnership
                           must withhold on the foreign partner's distributive share of the income on the earlier of the date that a Schedule K-1 (Form

                           FFI, or exempt beneficial owner. A withholding agent must also withhold 30% on a withholdable payment made on or after July

                           identify its substantial U.S. owners (or certify that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners) unless the payment is
                           excepted from withholding under the regulations to section 1472. A participating FFI is a withholding agent under chapter
                           4 and is required to withhold on a withholdable payment to the extent required under the FFI agreement, including on a payment
                           made to an account holder that the FFI is required to treat as a recalcitrant account holder. A reporting Model 1 FFI is required
                           to withhold under chapter 4 to the extent required in the applicable IGA. A registered deemed-compliant FFI (other than a
                           reporting Model 1 FFI) is required to withhold under chapter 4 to the extent required under the conditions applicable to its

                  <p>Chapter 4 withholding applies to withholdable payments made to an entity payee that is an FFI unless the withholding agent
                     is able to treat the FFI as a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or exempt beneficial owner. Chapter 4 withholding also
                     applies to withholdable payments made to a passive NFFE that fails to identify its substantial U.S. owners (or certify that
                     it does not have any substantial U.S. owners). You must establish the payee&#8217;s chapter 4 status to determine if withholding
                     applies by applying the documentation requirements of chapter 4, generally by obtaining a Form W-8 (or, under an applicable
                     IGA, a similar agreed form) associated with the payment, or other documentation for payments made outside of the United States
                     on offshore obligations. See Treasury regulations section 1.1471-3(d) for details on these documentation requirements. Withholding
                     under chapter 4 also applies to account holders of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that the FFI is
                     required to treat as recalcitrant account holders.

                        separate from its owner (a disregarded entity) for federal tax purposes. The payee of a payment made to a disregarded entity
                        is the owner of the entity. 
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If the owner of the entity is a foreign person, you must apply chapter 3 withholding unless you can treat the foreign
                        owner as a beneficial owner entitled to a reduced rate of withholding. 
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If the owner is a U.S. person, you do not apply chapter 3 withholding. However, you may be required to report the
                        payment on Form 1099 and, if applicable, backup withhold. You may assume that a foreign entity is not a disregarded entity
                        unless you can reliably associate the payment with documentation provided by the owner or you have actual knowledge or reason
                        to know that the foreign entity is a disregarded entity. 
                        <p></p>

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If you make a withholdable payment to a disregarded entity owned by an FFI, for chapter 4 purposes you must determine
                        whether you must treat the payment as made to a payee that is a nonparticipating FFI (to which chapter 4 withholding applies)
                        or a payee that is an FFI with another chapter 4 status (such as a participating FFI). If you make a withholdable payment
                        to a disregarded entity that is treated as a limited branch of a participating FFI or a registered deemed- compliant FFI,
                        you must treat the payment as made to a nonparticipating FFI and withhold 30% of the payment. See the Instructions to Form
                        W-8BEN-E for more information on payments to disregarded entities.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If you make a withholdable payment to a flow-through entity that is not one of the types described above, you must
                           treat the partner, beneficiary, or owner (as applicable) of the flow-through entity as the payee for chapter 4 purposes (similar
                           to the determination of the payee for chapter 3 purposes) (looking through partners, beneficiaries, and owners that are themselves
                           flow-through entities that are not one of the types described above).

                           rules, discussed later. 
                        </p>
                        <p>For purposes of chapter 3, you must determine whether the owners or beneficiaries of a flow-through entity are U.S. or foreign
                           persons, how much of the payment relates to each owner or beneficiary, and, if the owner or beneficiary is foreign, whether
                           a reduced rate of chapter 3 withholding applies. For purposes of chapter 4, you must determine the chapter 4 status of the
                           owners or beneficiaries of a flow-through entity (subject to the exceptions described above), how much of the payment relates
                           to each owner or beneficiary, and whether withholding under chapter 4 applies. You make these determinations based on the
                           documentation and other information (contained in a withholding statement) that is associated with the flow-through entity's
                           Form W-8IMY. If you do not have all of the information that is required to reliably associate a payment with a specific payee,
                           you must apply the presumption rules. See <a name="en_US_2016_publink100019490" href="ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000224819" title="Documentation">

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp; A foreign partnership is any partnership that is not organized under the laws of any state of the United States or
                           the District of Columbia or any partnership that is treated as foreign under the income tax regulations. If a foreign partnership
                           is not a withholding foreign partnership, the payees of income are the partners of the partnership, provided the partners
                           are not themselves flow-through entities or foreign intermediaries. However, the payee is the partnership itself if the partnership
                           is claiming treaty benefits on the basis that it is not treated as fiscally transparent in the treaty jurisdiction and that
                           it meets all the other requirements for claiming treaty benefits. If a partner is a foreign flow-through entity or a foreign
                           intermediary, you apply the payee determination rules to that partner to determine the payees. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of chapter 4, a foreign partnership is a payee of a withholdable payment if the partnership is a withholding
                           foreign partnership that is not acting as an agent or intermediary with respect to the payment. If the partnership is not
                           a withholding foreign partnership, the payees are the partners (looking through any partners that are flow-through entities
                           that are not treated as payees under the chapter 4 regulations).

                                 citizen. You make a payment of U.S. source interest to the partnership. Assume that the payment is subject to chapter 3 withholding
                                 but is not a withholdable payment. The partnership gives you a Form W-8IMY with which it associates Form W-8BEN from the nonresident
                                 alien; Form W-8BEN-E from the foreign corporation; and Form W-9 from the U.S. citizen. The partnership also gives you a complete
                                 withholding statement that enables you to associate a part of the interest payment to each partner.

                              <p>You must treat all three partners as the payees of their part of the interest payment as if the payment were made directly
                                 to them. Report the payments to the nonresident alien and the foreign corporation on Forms 1042-S. Report the payment to the
                                 U.S. citizen on Form 1099-INT. You do not need to determine the chapter 4 status of the partnership because the payment is
                                 not a withholdable payment.

                                 second partnership has two partners, both nonresident alien individuals. You make a payment of U.S. source interest to the
                                 first partnership. Assume that the payment is subject to chapter 3 withholding but is not a withholdable payment. The partnership
                                 gives you a valid Form W-8IMY with which it associates a Form W-8BEN-E from the foreign corporation and a Form W-8IMY from
                                 the second partnership. In addition, Forms W-8BEN from the partners are associated with the Form W-8IMY from the second partnership.
                                 The Forms W-8IMY from the partnerships have complete withholding statements associated with them. Because you can reliably
                                 associate a part of the interest payment with the Form W-8BEN-E provided by the foreign corporation and the Forms W-8BEN provided

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, a foreign simple trust is a foreign trust that is required to distribute all of its income annually.
                           A foreign grantor trust is a foreign trust that is treated as a grantor trust under sections 671 through 679 of the Code.
                           
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The payees of a payment made to a foreign simple trust are the beneficiaries of the trust. The payees of a payment
                           made to a foreign grantor trust are the owners of the trust. However, the payee is the foreign simple or grantor trust itself
                           if the trust is claiming treaty benefits on the basis that it is not fiscally transparent and that it meets all the other
                           requirements for claiming treaty benefits. If the beneficiaries or owners are themselves flow-through entities or foreign
                           intermediaries, you apply the payee determination rules to that beneficiary or owner to determine the payees.

                           <p>A foreign simple trust has three beneficiaries: two nonresident alien individuals and a U.S. citizen. You make a payment of
                              U.S. source interest to the foreign trust. Assume that the payment is subject to chapter 3 withholding but is not a withholdable
                              payment. The foreign trust gives you a Form W-8IMY with which it associates Forms W-8BEN from the nonresident aliens and a
                              Form W-9 from the U.S. citizen. The trust also gives you a complete withholding statement that enables you to associate the
                              interest payment with the forms provided by each beneficiary. You must treat all three beneficiaries as the payees of their
                              part of the interest payment as if the payment were made directly to them. Report the payment to the nonresident aliens on
                              Forms 1042-S. Report the payment to the U.S. citizen on Form 1099-INT. You do not need to establish the chapter 4 status of
                              the trust because the payment is not a withholdable payment.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;For chapter 3 purposes, a disregarded entity or flow-through entity should be treated as the payee and may claim treaty
                           benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States if it is a resident of the treaty country and it derives the item
                           of income. It does not need to be taxed on such item, but the item must be accounted for as the entity's income, not the interest
                           holders' income, under the law of the treaty country whose treaty it is invoking. It must also meet any other requirements
                           for claiming benefits, including a limitation on benefits article, if any, in the treaty. The entity should provide a Form
                           W-8BEN-E in such circumstances. If, for chapter 3 purposes, the payee is a foreign corporation or other non-flow through entity
                           for U.S. tax purposes, it is nonetheless not entitled to claim treaty benefits if the entity is fiscally transparent in its
                           country of residence (i.e., foreign reverse hybrid). Instead, if an interest holder is entitled to treaty benefits under its
                           country of residence, the payee may provide a Form W-8IMY and attach Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E from any interest holder that
                           claims treaty benefits on such income.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The determination of whether an entity is fiscally transparent is made on an item of income basis (that is, the determination
                           is made separately for interest, dividends, royalties, etc.). The interest holder in an entity makes the determination by
                           applying the laws of the jurisdiction where the interest holder is organized, incorporated, or otherwise considered a resident.
                           An entity is considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to the income to the extent the laws of that jurisdiction
                           require the interest holder to separately take into account on a current basis the interest holder's share of the income,
                           whether or not distributed to the interest holder, and the character and source of the income to the interest holder are determined
                           as if the income was realized directly from the source that paid it to the entity. Subject to the standards of knowledge rules
                           discussed later, you generally make the determination that an entity is fiscally transparent based on a Form W-8IMY provided
                           by the entity. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The payees of a payment made to a fiscally transparent entity are the interest holders of the entity.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;For chapter 4 purposes, if you are making a withholdable payment to a fiscally transparent entity, you must apply
                           the rules of chapter 4 to determine the payee (applying the rules described earlier) and whether chapter 4 withholding applies
                           to the payment based on the payee&#8217;s chapter 4 status. Thus, chapter 4 withholding may apply to a withholdable payment made
                           to a fiscally transparent entity based on the chapter 4 status of the entity even when the interest holders in the entity
                           would be eligible for reduced withholding under an income tax treaty with respect to the payment. Treaty benefits may be granted
                           to the interest holder when the payment made is not subject to chapter 4 withholding based on the chapter 4 status of both
                           the entity and the interest holder.

                           <p>Entity A is a business organization organized under the laws of country X that has an income tax treaty in force with the
                              United States. A has two interest holders, B and C. B is a corporation organized under the laws of country Y. C is a corporation
                              organized under the laws of country Z. Both countries Y and Z have an income tax treaty in force with the United States.
                           </p>
                           <p>A receives royalty income from U.S. sources that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the
                              United States and that is not a withholdable payment. The chapter 4 status of A does not need to be determined because the
                              payment is not a withholdable payment.
                           </p>
                           <p>For U.S. income tax purposes, A is treated as a partnership. Country X treats A as a partnership and requires the interest
                              holders in A to separately take into account on a current basis their respective shares of the income paid to A even if the
                              income is not distributed. The laws of country X provide that the character and source of the income to A's interest holders
                              are determined as if the income were realized directly from the source that paid it to A. Accordingly, A is fiscally transparent
                              in its jurisdiction, country X.
                           </p>
                           <p>B and C are not fiscally transparent under the laws of their respective countries of incorporation. Country Y requires B to
                              separately take into account on a current basis B's share of the income paid to A, and the character and source of the income
                              to B is determined as if the income were realized directly from the source that paid it to A. Accordingly, A is fiscally transparent
                              for that income under the laws of country Y, and B is treated as deriving its share of the U.S. source royalty income for
                              purposes of the U.S.-Y income tax treaty. Country Z, on the other hand, treats A as a corporation and does not require C to
                              take into account its share of A's income on a current basis whether or not distributed. Therefore, A is not treated as fiscally
                              transparent under the laws of country Z. Accordingly, C is not treated as deriving its share of the U.S. source royalty income
                              for purposes of the U.S.-Z income tax treaty.

                           collects the payment, such as account holders or customers, not the intermediary itself. This rule applies for purposes of
                           chapter 3 withholding and for Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding and chapter 4 withholding, provided the intermediary
                           is not a nonparticipating FFI to which you make a withholdable payment to which chapter 4 withholding applies. You may, however,
                           treat a qualified intermediary that has assumed primary withholding responsibility for a payment as the payee, and you are
                           not required to withhold.

                        <p>An intermediary is a custodian, broker, nominee, or any other person that acts as an agent for another person. A foreign intermediary
                           is either a qualified intermediary or a nonqualified intermediary. In most cases, you determine whether an entity is a qualified
                           intermediary or a nonqualified intermediary based on the representations the intermediary makes on Form W-8IMY. 
                        </p>
                        <p>For purposes of chapter 3, you must determine whether the customers or account holders of a foreign intermediary are U.S.
                           or foreign persons and, if the account holder or customer is foreign, whether a reduced rate of, or exemption from, chapter
                           3 withholding applies. For purposes of chapter 4, you must generally determine the chapter 4 status of the account holders
                           of a foreign intermediary if the payment is a withholdable payment. The determination for chapter 3 purposes is not required
                           when withholding applies under chapter 4 (i.e., when the chapter 4 status of the foreign intermediary is a nonparticipating
                           FFI (including a limited branch of a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI)) or a limited FFI (as defined in
                           Treasury regulations section 1.1471-1(b)(77)) or an entity or branch treated as a nonparticipating FFI under an applicable
                           IGA). You make these determinations based on the foreign intermediary's Form W-8IMY and associated information and documentation.
                           If you do not have all of the information or documentation that is required to reliably associate a payment with a payee,
                           you must apply the presumption rules of chapter 3, and must apply the presumption rules of chapter 4 to the foreign intermediary

                           the IRS. You may treat a QI as a payee to the extent it assumes primary chapters 3 and 4 withholding responsibility or primary
                           Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility for a payment. In this situation, the QI is required to withhold
                           the tax. You can determine whether a QI has assumed responsibility from the Form W-8IMY provided by the QI.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A payment to a QI to the extent it does not assume primary chapters 3 and 4 withholding responsibility is considered
                           made to the person on whose behalf the QI acts. If a QI does not assume Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility,
                           you must report on Form 1099 and, if applicable, backup withhold as if you were making the payment directly to the U.S. person.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Special rules apply to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank subject to Federal Reserve Board supervision or a foreign insurance
                           company subject to state regulatory supervision. Effective July 1, 2014, you must obtain a branch&#8217;s chapter 4 status, if required
                           for chapter 4 purposes. You can generally treat the branch as a U.S. person for a withholdable payment only when you document
                           its status as a participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or an insurance company that is an NFFE. If you make a
                           payment of an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or insurance
                           company that is a participating FFI, a registered deemed-compliant FFI, or an NFFE that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person,
                           you may treat the U.S. branch as a payee that is a U.S. person, provided you receive a Form W-8IMY from the U.S. branch that
                           you can reliably associate with the payment. If you treat the branch as a U.S. person, you are not required to withhold on
                           an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable payment. Even though you agree to treat the branch as a U.S.
                           person, you must report the payments made to the branch on Form 1042-S.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A territory financial institution is a financial institution as defined for chapter 4 purposes (except when it is
                           an investment entity that is not also a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company) incorporated
                           or organized under the laws of a possession of the United States. A territory financial institution that is an intermediary
                           or flow-through entity is treated as a U.S. branch that agrees to be treated as a U.S. person. The special rules described
                           in this section apply to a territory financial institution. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If you are paying a U.S. branch an amount that is not subject to chapter 3 withholding and is not a withholdable payment,
                           treat the payment as made to a foreign person, irrespective of any agreement to treat the branch as a U.S. person for such
                           amounts. Consequently, amounts not subject to chapter 3 withholding and that are not withholdable payments that are paid to
                           a U.S. branch are not subject to Form 1099 reporting or backup withholding.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, a U.S. branch may provide you with a Form W-8IMY with which it associates the documentation of the
                           persons on whose behalf it acts. In this situation, the U.S. branch is not treated as a U.S. person, and the payees are the
                           persons on whose behalf the branch acts provided you can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation from those
                           persons. See <a name="en_US_2016_publink1000256575" href="ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000224845" title="Nonqualified Intermediaries">

                           for the branch, you should treat the payment as a payment to a foreign person of income that is effectively connected with
                           the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If you cannot reliably associate the payment with a Form W-8IMY from
                           the U.S. branch and you have not obtained an EIN for the branch, you should treat the payment as a payment to a foreign person

                           to the IRS, along with any additional information and documentation requested by the IRS. The WP or WT will be assigned a
                           WP-EIN or WT-EIN to be used only when acting in that capacity. A WP or WT that is an FFI (other than a retirement fund) must
                           also register with the IRS through the FATCA registration website available at <a xmlns:java-call="gov.irs.xmlbulkcontent.core.link.GetURL" href="http://www.irs.gov/FATCA" target="_top">www.irs.gov/FATCA </a> to renew its WP agreement or WT agreement and obtain its applicable chapter 4 status and GIIN.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A WP or WT must provide you with a Form W-8IMY that certifies that the WP or WT is acting in that capacity and provides
                           all other information and certifications required by the form, including its WP-EIN or WT-EIN. When you make a withholdable
                           payment to a WP or WT, the WP or WT generally may also provide a certificate of a chapter 4 status permitted of a WP or WT
                           (and GIIN if applicable). The WP or WT, when acting in such capacity, is not required to provide a withholding statement and
                           is not required to disclose any information regarding its direct partners, beneficiaries, or owners or any indirect partner,
                           beneficiary, or owner for which it acts as a WP or WT that is not a U.S. non-exempt recipient (except for a U.S. non-exempt
                           recipient included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees). A chapter 4 withholding rate pool also means a payment
                           of a single type of income that is allocated to U.S. payees when the WP provides the certification required on Form W-8IMY
                           for allocating payments to this pool. When a WP or WT is not acting as a WP or WT with respect to an amount distributed to,
                           or included in the distributive share of, an indirect partner, beneficiary, or owner, it must provide you with a nonwithholding
                           foreign partnership or nonwithholding foreign trust withholding certificate on a Form W-8IMY and documentation for its indirect
                           partners, beneficiaries, and owners that are not included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;A payee is subject to  withholding only if it is a foreign person. A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual,
                        foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, foreign estate, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It
                        also includes a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. In most

                        tax even if it was formed under foreign law. In most cases, you do not have to withhold tax on payments of income to these
                        foreign tax-exempt organizations unless the IRS has determined that they are foreign private foundations.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Payments to these organizations, however, must be reported on Form 1042-S if the payment is subject to chapter 3 withholding,

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;You must withhold tax on the unrelated business income (as described in Publication 598, Tax on Unrelated Business
                        Income of Exempt Organizations) of foreign tax-exempt organizations in the same way that you would withhold tax on similar

                        connected with a U.S. trade or business of the organization.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment made to the foreign person. However, you

                        subject to U.S. regulatory supervision as payments made to a U.S. person, if you and the U.S. branch have agreed to do so,
                        and if their agreement is evidenced by a withholding certificate, Form W-8IMY. For this purpose, a territory financial institution
                        acting as an intermediary or that is a flow-through entity is treated as a U.S. branch.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 1446 of the Code, a partnership must withhold tax on its effectively connected income allocable to a
                        foreign partner. In most cases, a partnership determines if a partner is a foreign partner and the partner's tax classification
                        based on the withholding certificate provided by the partner. This is the same documentation that is filed for chapter 3 withholding,
                        but may require additional information as discussed under each of the forms in this section.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If you make a payment to joint payees (such as holders of a joint account), you need to get documentation from each
                        payee. If you make a payment to joint payees and cannot reliably associate the payment with documentation from all of the
                        payees, you generally must presume the payment is made to an unidentified U.S. person. If the payment is a withholdable payment
                        and any of the payees does not appear, by name or other information in the account file, to be an individual, you must treat
                        the entire amount as a payment made to an undocumented foreign person. However, if one of the joint payees has provided you
                        with a Form W-9, you must treat the payment as made to that payee.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, you can treat the payee as a U.S. person if the payee gives you a Form W-9. The Form W-9 can be used
                        only by a U.S. person and must contain the payee's taxpayer identification number (TIN). If there is more than one owner,
                        you may treat the total amount as paid to a U.S. person if any one of the owners gives you a Form W-9. See <a name="en_US_2016_publink100019497" href="ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000225029" title="U.S. or Foreign Taxpayer Identification Numbers">

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If a payment is made outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation, a payee may give you documentary
                        evidence, rather than a Form W-8, to establish that the payee is a foreign person. See Treasury regulations section 1.6049-5(c)(1)
                        for the requirements for documentary evidence for offshore obligations. For accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, through
                        December 31, 2014, you may use the rules regarding the use of documentary evidence under Treasury regulations sections 1.6049-5(c)(1)
                        and (c)(4) as in effect prior to the issuance of the temporary regulations.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;A payment is made outside the United States if you complete the acts necessary to effect the payment outside the United
                        States. However, an amount paid by a bank or other financial institution on a deposit or account usually will be treated as
                        paid at the branch or office where the amount is credited unless the other requirements of Treasury regulations section 1.6049-5(e)(2)
                        are met with respect to the branch or office, unless the amount is collected by the financial institution as an agent of the
                        payee. An offshore obligation is an account maintained at an office or branch of a bank or other financial institution located
                        outside the United States or an obligation, contract, or other instrument with respect to which the payor of the payment is
                        either engaged in business as a broker or dealer in securities or a financial institution that engages in significant activities
                        at an office or branch located outside the United States.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;You may rely on documentary evidence given to you by a nonqualified intermediary or a flow-through entity with its
                        Form W-8IMY. This rule applies even though you make the payment to a nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity in the
                        United States. In most cases, the nonqualified intermediary or flow-through entity that gives you documentary evidence also
                        will have to give you a withholding statement, discussed later.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;You may apply a reduced rate of withholding to income from marketable securities (discussed earlier) paid outside
                        the United States with respect to an offshore obligation if the beneficial owner gives you documentary evidence in place of
                        a Form W-8. To claim treaty benefits, the documentary evidence must be one of the following:

                           <p>Form W-8BEN is now used exclusively by individuals. Entities documenting their status as a foreign person and beneficial owner
                              for chapter 3 purposes, their chapter 4 status as a payee for chapter 4 purposes, or eligibility for making a claim of treaty
                              benefits (if applicable) should use Form W-8BEN-E.

                           <p>A withholding agent in some cases may substitute its own form for a Form W-8BEN for individuals. Solely for purposes of chapter
                              3, a Form W-8BEN with a revision date February 2006 provided to you by an entity before January 1, 2015 will remain valid
                              until the form&#8217;s validity expires under the applicable chapter 3 regulations. For purposes of chapter 4, a Form W-8BEN with
                              a revision date February 2006 provided to you by an entity before such date is and will remain valid to the extent permitted

                        for income that is not subject to chapter 3 withholding and is not a withholdable payment. For example, a foreign person may
                        provide a Form W-8BEN to a broker to establish that the gross proceeds from the sale of securities are not subject to Form

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;An entity payee also may provide a Form W-8BEN-E to establish that certain income from notional principal contracts
                        is not effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. In addition, a foreign hybrid entity claiming treaty
                        benefits on its own behalf should provide you with a Form W-8BEN-E with respect to the income for which treaty benefits are
                        being claimed. In certain cases, a similar agreed form may be associated with the payment instead of a Form W-8BEN-E.

                           intermediary that has received a QI employer identification number (QI-EIN) may represent on Form W-8IMY that it is a QI.
                           The intermediary can claim that it is a QI until the IRS revokes its QI-EIN. 
                        </p>
                        <p>A QI can be either an FFI or an NFFE. An FFI (other than a retirement fund) that is a QI must be a participating FFI (including
                           a reporting Model 2 FFI), a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI and a nonreporting Model 2
                           FFI treated as registered deemed-compliant), or an FFI treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under an applicable Model 1 IGA that
                           is subject to similar due diligence and reporting requirements with respect to its U.S. accounts as those applicable to a

Thus, you must identify the chapter 4 status of an FFI certifying its status
                           as a QI as one of the chapter 4 statuses referenced in the preceding sentence on a Form W-8IMY when a chapter 4 status is
                           required for chapter 4 purposes.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Payments made to a QI that does not assume primary chapters 3 and 4 withholding responsibilities are treated as paid
                           to its account holders. However, a QI is not required to provide you with documentation it obtains from its foreign account
                           holders or from U.S. exempt recipients (U.S. persons exempt from Form 1099 reporting). Instead, it provides you with a withholding
                           statement that contains either chapter 3 or chapter 4 withholding rate pool information. A chapter 4 withholding rate pool
                           is a payment of a single type of income that is a withholdable payment that is allocated to payees that are nonparticipating
                           FFIs or recalcitrant account holders (in a single pool). A chapter 4 withholding rate pool also means a payment of a single
                           type of income that is allocated to U.S. payees when the QI provides the certification required on Form W-8IMY for allocating
                           payments to this pool and a withholding statement. A QI may include in its chapter 4 withholding rate pools its direct account
                           holders as well as account holders of another QI or a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI. With respect to
                           a payment to a foreign person for which no chapter 4 withholding is required, a chapter 3 withholding rate pool is a payment
                           of a single type of income that is subject to a single rate of withholding and that is reported on Form 1042-S under a single
                           chapter 4 exemption code. Payments made to U.S. exempt recipients may also be included in a chapter 3 withholding rate pool
                           to which withholding does not apply. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A QI is required to provide you with information regarding U.S. non-exempt recipients (U.S. persons subject to Form
                           1099 information reporting) and to provide you withholding rate pool information separately for each such U.S. person unless
                           it has assumed primary Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding responsibility and meets the requirements to include these
                           recipients in a U.S. payee pool. For the alternative procedure for providing withholding rate pool information for U.S. non-exempt
                           persons not included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, see the Form W-8IMY instructions.

                              dividends; and one is a U.S. individual who provides it with a Form W-9. Each customer is entitled to 20% of the dividend
                              payment. The QI does not assume any primary withholding responsibility. The QI gives you a Form W-8IMY with which it associates

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A QI is generally permitted to report payments made to its foreign account holders on a pooled basis rather than reporting
                           payments to each account holder specifically. Pooled basis reporting is not available for payments to certain account holders,
                           such as nonqualified intermediaries, flow-through entities (discussed earlier) and certain of their account holders and owners,
                           private arrangement intermediaries, partnerships or trusts to which the QI applies the joint account or agency option (discussed
                           later), and, in certain circumstances, qualified intermediaries, withholding foreign partnerships, and withholding foreign
                           trusts. Notwithstanding these requirements, separate Forms 1042-S are not issued to account holders that the QI is permitted
                           to include in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A QI may seek a refund of tax withheld under chapters 3 and 4 on behalf of its account holders when the QI has not
                           issued a Form 1042-S to the account holders that received the payment that was subject to overwithholding. The account holders,
                           therefore, are not required to file claims for refund with the IRS to obtain refunds, but rather may obtain them from the
                           QI. A QI may obtain a refund of tax withheld under chapter 4, however, to the extent permitted under the QI agreement.

                           as described in the chapter 4 regulations), and, for an NQI that is a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI)
                           or a registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), U.S. payees. However, an NQI may allocate a payment

                           of U.S. payees when the NQI satisfies the requirements for providing such a pool, including the requirement to certify to

                           Model 1 FFI. If the FFI withholding statement instead includes payee specific information for purposes of chapter 4, it must
                           indicate both the portion of the payment allocated to each payee and each payee&#8217;s chapter 4 status. The withholding statement
                           must also identify each intermediary or flow-through entity that is receiving a payment (excluding any intermediary or flow-through
                           entity that is an account holder or interest holder in another QI, WP, or WT), each such entity&#8217;s chapter 4 status and GIIN

                           each payee&#8217;s chapter 4 status for payees that are not included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of nonparticipating FFIs.

                           than prior to the payment being made as otherwise required. To take advantage of this procedure, the NQI must: (a) inform
                           you, on its withholding statement, that it is using the alternative procedure; and (b) obtain your consent. You must receive
                           the withholding statement with all the required information (other than item 5) prior to making the payment.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a reportable amount that is also a withholdable payment, an NQI may include amounts allocable to a
                           chapter 4 withholding rate pool (other than a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees) and payees subject to chapter
                           4 withholding for whom the NQI will provide payee specific information in a 30-percent rate pool together with payees subject
                           to chapter 3 withholding at the 30-percent rate. For the amount of the payment allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool
                           of U.S. payees, an NQI may include amounts allocable to the pool with other amounts exempt from withholding (and an NQI may
                           allocate payments to this pool regardless of whether the payment is a withholdable payment) and may not otherwise apply these
                           provisions for payments made to U.S. non-exempt recipients. The NQI must identify prior to the payment each chapter 4 withholding
                           rate pool to be allocated a portion of the payment, in addition to each payee to be allocated the payments that is not included
                           in such a pool. The NQI must then also allocate, by January 31 following the calendar year of the payment, the portion of
                           the payment to each such pool in addition to allocating the payment to each payee that is not included in the pool.

                           year of payment, you must file a Form 1042-S for each account holder in the pool on a pro-rata basis (treating a chapter 4
                           withholding rate pool as an account holder for this purpose and excluding U.S. exempt recipients). For example, if there are
                           four account holders in a withholding rate pool that receives a $100 payment and the NQI fails to allocate more than $10 of
                           the payment, you must file four Forms 1042-S, one for each account holder in the pool, showing $25 of income to each. You
                           must also check the &#8220;<span class="quote">Pro-rata Basis Reporting</span>&#8221; box at the top of each form. If, however, the nonqualified intermediary provides allocation information for 90% or more
                           of the payment to a withholding rate pool, the pro-rata reporting method is not required. Instead, you must file a Form 1042-S
                           for each account holder for whom you have allocation information and report the unallocated part of the payment on a Form
                           1042-S issued to &#8220;<span class="quote">unknown recipient.</span>&#8221;

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The WP may determine the amount of withholding based on a reasonable estimate of the partner's distributive share
                           of income subject to withholding for the year. The WP must correct the estimated withholding to reflect the actual distributive
                           share on the earlier of the dates mentioned in the preceding paragraph. If that date is after the due date (including extensions)
                           for filing the WP's Forms 1042 and 1042-S for the calendar year, the WP may withhold and report any adjustments in the following
                           calendar year.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The WP must file Form 1042 even if no amount was withheld. In addition to the information that is required for the
                           Form 1042, the WP must attach a statement showing the amounts of any over- or under-withholding adjustments and an explanation
                           of those adjustments.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The WP can elect to report payments made to its foreign direct partners on a pooled basis for chapter 3 purposes rather
                           than reporting payments to each direct partner in addition to reporting payments in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool to the
                           extent the WP is permitted to do so based on its chapter 4 status. A WP can treat as its direct partners those indirect partners
                           of the WP for which it applies joint account treatment or the agency option (described later). A WP must otherwise issue a
                           Form 1042-S to each partner to the extent it is required to do so under the WP agreement. You may issue a single Form 1042-S
                           for all payments you make to a WP other than payments for which the entity does not act as a WP. You may, however, have Form
                           1099 requirements for certain indirect partners of a WP that are U.S. non-exempt recipients.

                           a Form 1042-S to the partners that received the payment that was subject to overwithholding. The partners, therefore, are
                           not required to file claims for refund with the IRS to obtain refunds, but rather may obtain them from the WP. A WP may obtain

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A WP must report its U.S. partners on Schedule K-1 to the extent required under the WP agreement. If the WP is an

                           8966 consistent with its chapter 4 requirements or the requirements of an IGA. If the WP is an NFFE, WP must file Form 8966
                           to report any partner that is an NFFE (other than an excepted NFFE) with one or more substantial U.S. owners (or, under an
                           applicable IGA, controlling persons that are specified U.S. persons) if the NFFE is the beneficial owner of a withholdable
                           payment received by the WP. The WP must also file a Form 8966 to report withholdable payments made to a passthrough partner
                           for which the WP acts under the WP agreement that provides information on an account holder (or interest holder) that is an
                           NFFE (other than an excepted NFFE) with one or more substantial U.S. owners (or, under an applicable IGA, controlling persons
                           that are specified U.S. persons) and that is the beneficial owner of the withholdable payment received by WP, unless the passthrough
                           partner certifies to the WP that it is reporting on the account holder (or interest holder) pursuant to its U.S. account reporting
                           requirements. The preceding sentence applies with respect to a passthrough partner to which WP applies the agency option or
                           which has partners, beneficiaries, or owners that are indirect partners of WP.

                           any direct beneficiary or owner and may assume primary chapters 3 and 4 withholding responsibility for certain of its indirect
                           beneficiaries or owners. The WT must withhold the amount required to be withheld. A WT must provide you with a Form W-8IMY
                           that certifies that the WT is acting in that capacity and provides all other information and certifications required by the
                           form. The Form W-8IMY must contain the WT-EIN and GIIN (if applicable).

                           the WT must withhold on the beneficiary's or owner's distributive share on the earlier of the date that the trust must mail
                           or otherwise provide to the beneficiary or owner the statement required under section 6048(b) or the due date for furnishing

                           share of income subject to withholding for the year. The WT must correct the estimated withholding to reflect the actual distributive
                           share on the earlier of the dates mentioned in the preceding paragraph. If that date is after the due date (including extensions)
                           for filing the WT's Forms 1042 and 1042-S for the calendar year, the WT may withhold and report any adjustments in the following

                           in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool to the extent the WT is permitted to do so based on its chapter 4 status. A WT can treat

                           treatment or the agency option (described later). A WT must otherwise issue a Form 1042-S to each beneficiary or owner to
                           the extent it is required to do so under the WT agreement. You may issue a single Form 1042-S for all payments you make to
                           a WT other than payments for which the entity does not act as a WT. You may, however, have Form 1099 requirements for certain
                           indirect beneficiaries or owners of a WT that are U.S. non-exempt recipients.

                           The beneficiaries or owners, therefore, are not required to file claims for refund with the IRS to obtain refunds, but rather
                           may obtain them from the WT. A WT may obtain a refund of tax withheld under chapter 4 to the extent permitted under the WT

                           an owner and receives a distribution. If the WT is an FFI, it is required to report each of its U.S. accounts (or U.S. reportable
                           accounts if a reporting Model 1 FFI) on Form 8966 consistent with its FATCA requirements or the requirements of an IGA. If
                           the WT is an NFFE, WT must file Form 8966 to report any beneficiary or owner that is an NFFE (other than an excepted NFFE)
                           with one or more substantial U.S. owners (or, under an applicable IGA, controlling persons that are specified U.S. persons)
                           if the NFFE is the beneficial owner of a withholdable payment received by the WT. The WT must also file a Form 8966 to report
                           withholdable payments made to a passthrough beneficiary or owner for which the WT acts under the WT agreement that provides
                           information on an account holder (or interest holder) that is an NFFE (other than an excepted NFFE) with one or more substantial
                           U.S. owners (or, under an applicable IGA, controlling persons that are specified U.S. persons) and that is the beneficial
                           owner of the withholdable payment received by WT, unless the passthrough beneficiary or owner certifies to the WT that it
                           is reporting on the account holder (or interest holder) pursuant to its U.S. account reporting requirements. The preceding
                           sentence applies with respect to a passthrough beneficiary or owner to which WT applies the agency option or which has partners,
                           beneficiaries, or owners that are indirect beneficiaries or owners of WT. In addition, if the WT is not a participating FFI,
                           a registered deemed-compliant FFI, or a registered deemed-compliant Model 1 IGA FFI and is not required to report with respect
                           to a U.S. beneficiary of WT on Form 3520-A, then the WT must report with respect to such beneficiary on Form 8966 as required
                           in the WT agreement. A beneficiary for this purpose means a beneficiary that receives a distribution from the WT during the
                           year or that is required to include an amount in gross income under sections 652(a) or 662(a) with respect to the WT.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A WT may act as a WT with respect to an indirect beneficiary or owner of the WT that is not a U.S. non-exempt recipient.
                           However, a WT may act as a WT for an indirect beneficiary or owner that is a U.S. non-exempt recipient if the indirect beneficiary
                           or owner is included in a passthrough beneficiary&#8217;s or owner&#8217;s chapter 4 withholding rate pool of recalcitrant account holders
                           or U.S. payees. A WT acting as a WT for an indirect beneficiary or owner is not required to forward to its withholding agent
                           the documentation and the withholding statement of the passthrough beneficiary or owner and indirect beneficiary or owner
                           that the WT would have otherwise been required to provide under the requirements of a nonwithholding foreign trust. See <a name="en_US_2016_publink100015627" href="ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000224864" title="Not acting as WT. ">

                                                   </a>, later. However, a WT must provide the withholding agent with documentation and any other information from any passthrough
                           beneficiary or owner whose direct or indirect partner, beneficiary, or owner is a U.S. non-exempt recipient unless the recipient
                           is included in the passthrough beneficiary&#8217;s or owner&#8217;s chapter 4 withholding rate pool of recalcitrant account holders or
                           U.S. payees. If WT is making a payment that is a withholdable payment, the passthrough beneficiary&#8217;s or owner&#8217;s withholding
                           statement must meet the requirements of Treasury regulations section 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B). The passthrough beneficiary&#8217;s
                           or owner&#8217;s withholding statement must include the account holders or interest holders of the passthrough beneficiary or owner
                           in chapter 4 withholding rate pools (to the extent permitted), and, for an amount subject to chapter 3 withholding that is
                           not a withholdable payment or is a withholdable payment for which chapter 4 withholding is not required, valid documentation
                           provided by the account holders or interest holders of the passthrough beneficiary or owner that are not themselves qualified

                        <p>In general, you have reason to know that a claim of chapter 4 status is unreliable or incorrect if your knowledge of relevant
                           facts or statements contained in the withholding certificate or other documentation is such that a reasonably prudent person
                           would question the claim being made. For an obligation other than a preexisting obligation (i.e., an obligation other than
                           an obligation, including an account, held by an individual that is outstanding on June 30, 2014, or an obligation, including
                           an account, held by an entity that is opened, executed, or issued before January 1, 2015), you have reason to know that a

                           account files, including documentation collected for AML due diligence purposes, conflicts with the chapter 4 status being
                           claimed. You will not have reason to know that a claim of chapter 4 status is unreliable or incorrect based on documentation
                           collected for AML due diligence purposes until the date that is 30 days after the obligation is created.

                           all documentation obtained with respect to the payee. Under certain circumstances, you may rely on a withholding certificate
                           that has been collected from the payee through an electronic system maintained by an account holder that is an NQI, NWP, or

When withholding under chapter 4 is not applied based on

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;You must review each withholding certificate, written statement (as permitted for chapter 4 purposes with respect

                           not know or have reason to know that the documentation is unreliable or incorrect. See Treasury regulations section 1.1471-3(d)

                        liable for tax, interest, and penalties. If you comply with the presumption rules, you are not liable for tax, interest, and
                        penalties even if the rate of withholding that should have been applied based on the payee's actual status is different from
                        that presumed. 
                     </p>
                     <p>The presumption rules apply to determine the status of the person you pay as a U.S. or foreign person and other relevant characteristics,
                        such as whether the payee is a beneficial owner or intermediary, and whether the payee is an individual, corporation, partnership,
                        or trust. In the case of a withholdable payment you make to an entity, you must apply the presumption rules for chapter 4
                        purposes to treat the entity as a nonparticipating FFI when you cannot reliably associate the payment with documentation permitted
                        for chapter 4 purposes. You are not permitted to apply a reduced rate of chapter 3 withholding based on a payee's presumed
                        status if documentation is required to establish a reduced rate of withholding. For example, if the payee of interest is presumed
                        to be a foreign person, you may not apply the portfolio interest exception or a reduced rate of withholding under a tax treaty
                        since both exceptions require documentation. 
                     </p>
                     <p>If you rely on your actual knowledge about a payee's status and withhold an amount less than that required under the presumption
                        rules or do not report a payment that is subject to reporting under the presumption rules, you may be liable for tax, interest,
                        and penalties. You should, however, rely on your actual knowledge if doing so results in withholding an amount greater than
                        would apply under the presumption rules or in reporting an amount that would not be subject to reporting under the presumption
                        rules. 
                     </p>
                     <p>In the case of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that cannot report with respect to an individual account
                        holder, the FFI must classify the account holder under the requirements (as applicable) of the FFI agreement, Treasury regulations
                        section 1.1471-5(f), or an applicable IGA. Whether withholding applies to payments made to such account holders classified
                        as recalcitrant account holders (including payments to intermediaries or flow-through entities allocating payments to such
                        account holders on an applicable withholding statement) differs under these requirements.
                     </p>
                     <p>The presumption rules, in the absence of documentation, for the subject matter are discussed in the regulation section indicated

                        In most cases, you make this allocation on a time basis. That is, U.S. source income is the amount that results from multiplying
                        the total amount of pay by the following fraction:

                              &nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, the source of multi-year compensation is determined on a time basis over the period to which the compensation
                        is attributable. Multi-year compensation is compensation that is included in the taxable income of a recipient in one tax
                        year but that is attributable to a period that includes two or more tax years. The determination of the period to which the
                        compensation is attributable, for purposes of determining its source, is based on the facts and circumstances of each case.
                        For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years
                        is attributable to the entire multi-year period. Where determining the source of multi-level compensation on a time basis
                        is appropriate, the amount of compensation treated as from U.S. sources is figured by multiplying the total multi-year compensation
                        by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that
                        labor or personal services were performed in the United States in connection with the project. The denominator of the fraction
                        is the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that labor or personal services were performed
                        in connection with the project.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;An employee's main job location (principal place of work) is usually the place where the employee spends most of his
                        or her working time. If there is no one place where most of the work time is spent, the main job location is the place where
                        the work is centered, such as where the employee reports for work or is otherwise required to base his or her work.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;An employee can use an alternative basis based on facts and circumstances, rather than the time or geographical basis.
                        The employee, not the employer, must demonstrate that the alternative basis more properly determines the source of the pay
                        or fringe benefits.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain companies sell products through a multi-level marketing arrangement, such that an upper-tier distributor,
                        who has sponsored a lower-tier distributor, is entitled to a payment from the company based on certain activities of that
                        lower-tier distributor. Generally, depending on the facts, payments from such multi-level marketing companies to independent
                        (non-employee) distributors (upper-tier distributors) that are based on the sales or purchases of persons whom they have sponsored
                        (lower-tier distributors) constitute income for the performance of personal services in recruiting, training, and supporting
                        the lower-tier distributors. The source of such income is generally based on where the services of the upper-tier distributor
                        are performed, and may, depending on the facts, be considered multi-year compensation, with the source of income determined
                        over the period to which such compensation is attributable.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The source of pension payments is determined by the part of the distribution that constitutes the compensation element

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation element is sourced the same as compensation from the performance of personal services. The part attributable
                        to services performed in the United States is U.S. source income, and the part attributable to services performed outside

                        available to provide benefits to any participant. If the payment is from such a plan, you can use the method in Revenue Procedure
                        2004-37 to allocate the payment to sources in and out of the United States. Revenue Procedure 2004-37, 2004-26 I.R.B.1099,

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Income can be FDAP income whether it is paid in a series of repeated payments or in a single lump sum. For example,
                        $5,000 in royalty income would be FDAP income whether paid in 10 payments of $500 each or in one payment of $5,000.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Income derived by an insured nonresident alien from U.S. sources upon the surrender of, or at the maturity of, a life
                        insurance policy, is FDAP income and is subject to chapter 3 withholding and is a withholdable payment. This includes income
                        derived under a life insurance contract issued by a foreign branch of a U.S. life insurance company. The proceeds are income
                        to the extent they exceed the cost of the policy. 
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;However, certain payments received under a life insurance contract on the life of a terminally or chronically ill
                        individual before death (accelerated death benefits) may not be subject to tax. This also applies to certain payments received
                        for the sale or assignment of any part of the death benefit under contract to a viatical settlement provider. See Publication
                        525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information.

                        owner in the absence of definite information contained in a statement filed together with a Form W-8 that the owner has not
                        raced, or does not intend to enter, a horse in another race in the United States during the tax year. If available information
                        indicates that the racehorse owner has raced a horse in another race in the United States during the tax year, then the statement
                        and Form W-8 filed for that year are ineffective. The owner may be exempt from withholding of tax at 30% on the purses if
                        the owner gives you Form W-8ECI, which provides that the income is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade
                        or business and that the income is includible in the owner's gross income.

                        the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. You must treat the income as effectively connected with a U.S. trade

                        the rate is usually 30%. In most cases, you must withhold the tax at the time you pay the income to the foreign person. See

                           price of an obligation sold or exchanged, other than in a redemption, is not subject to chapter 3 withholding unless the purchase
                           is part of a plan the principal purpose of which is to avoid tax and the withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason
                           to know of the plan. However, such original issue discount is a withholdable payment (except when paid with respect to a grandfathered
                           obligation). Withholding is required by a person other than the issuer of an obligation (or the issuer's agent).

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The original issue discount that is subject to chapter 3 withholding and is a withholdable payment (except when paid
                           with respect to a grandfathered obligation) is the taxable amount of original issue discount. The taxable amount for both
                           chapters 3 and 4 withholding purposes is the original issue discount that accrued while the obligation was held by the foreign
                           beneficial owner up to the time the obligation was sold or exchanged or a payment was made, reduced by any original issue
                           discount that was previously taxed. If a payment was made, the tax due on the original issue discount may not exceed the payment
                           reduced by the tax imposed on the part of the payment that is qualified stated interest. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot determine the taxable amount, you must withhold on the entire amount of original issue discount accrued
                           from the date of issue until the date of redemption (or sale or exchange, if subject to chapter 3 withholding or a withholdable
                           payment) determined on the basis of the most recently published Publication 1212, Guide to Original Issue Discount (OID) Instruments.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Portfolio interest includes interest paid on an obligation that is in registered form, and for which you have received
                           documentation that the beneficial owner of the obligation is not a United States person. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, an obligation is in registered form if: (i) the obligation is registered as to both principal and any stated
                           interest with the issuer (or its agent) and any transfer of the obligation may be effected only by surrender of the old obligation
                           and reissuance to the new holder; (ii) the right to principal and stated interest with respect to the obligation may be transferred
                           only through a book entry system maintained by the issuer or its agent; or (iii) the obligation is registered as to both principal
                           and stated interest with the issuer or its agent and can be transferred both by surrender and reissuance and through a book
                           entry system. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;An obligation that would otherwise be considered to be in registered form is not considered to be in registered form
                           as of a particular time if it can be converted at any time in the future into an obligation that is not in registered form,
                           except as otherwise provided in <a xmlns:java-call="gov.irs.xmlbulkcontent.core.link.GetURL" href="http://www.irs.gov/irb/2013-31_IRB/ar07.html" target="_top">Notice 2013-43, 2013-31 I.R.B. 113</a>, as described in the following section.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;An obligation will be considered to be in registered form if it is issued through either a dematerialized book entry
                           system maintained by a clearing organization (or agent thereof) or a clearing system in which the obligation (including a
                           global obligation in bearer form) is effectively immobilized.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Under dematerialized book-entry systems, bonds are required to be represented only by book entries, and no physical
                           certificates are issued or transferred. The bonds are transferred only by book entries.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;An obligation will be considered to be effectively immobilized if (1) it is represented by one or more global securities
                           in physical form that are issued to and held by a clearing organization (or by a custodian or depository acting as an agent
                           of the clearing organization) for the benefit of purchasers and under arrangements that prohibit transfer except to a successor
                           clearing organization subject to the same terms, and (2) beneficial interest in the underlying obligation are transferrable
                           only through a book entry system maintained by the clearing organization or its agent.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;These bonds are considered to be in registered form if the holder may only obtain a physical certificate in bearer
                           form when:  (1) the clearing organization that maintains the book-entry system goes out of business without a successor; (2)
                           the issuer defaults; or (3) definitive securities are issued at the issuer&#8217;s request upon a change in tax law adverse to the
                           issuer. See Notice 2012-20 for more information on registered form requirements.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A registered bond issued after March 18, 2012, and before January 1, 2016, will also be considered to be in registered
                           form if it is targeted to foreign markets, and portfolio interest treatment may apply even when you do not receive documentation
                           regarding the beneficial owner of the bond.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If the registered obligation is not targeted to foreign markets, you must receive documentation on which you may rely
                           to treat the payee as a foreign person that is the beneficial owner of the interest. A registered obligation is targeted to
                           foreign markets if it is sold (or resold in connection with its original issuance) only to foreign persons or to foreign branches
                           of U. S. financial institutions in accordance with procedures similar to those provided under section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i) of
                           the regulations. However, the procedure that requires the obligation to be offered for sale (or resale) only outside the United
                           States does not apply if the registered obligation is offered for sale through a public auction. Also, the procedure that
                           requires the obligation to be delivered outside the United States does not apply if the obligation is considered registered
                           because it may be transferred only through a book-entry system and the obligation is offered for sale through a public auction.
                           The documentation needed depends on whether the interest is paid to a financial institution, a member of a clearing organization,
                           or to some other foreign person. See Notice 2012-20 and Treasury regulations section 1.871-14(e) for more information on foreign-targeted
                           registered obligations.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A treaty may permit a reduced rate or exemption for interest paid by a domestic corporation to a controlling foreign
                           corporation. The interest may be on any type of debt, including open or unsecured accounts payable, notes, certificates, bonds,

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp; If a foreign corporation is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, any interest paid by the foreign corporation's trade
                           or business in the United States (branch interest) is subject to chapter 3 withholding as if paid by a domestic corporation
                           (without considering the &#8220;<span class="quote">payer having income from abroad</span>&#8221; exception) and is a withholdable payment. As a result, the interest paid to foreign payees is generally subject to chapter
                           3 withholding and withholding may apply under chapter 4 absent an applicable withholding exception. In addition, if &#8220;<span class="quote">allocable interest</span>&#8221; exceeds the branch interest paid, the excess interest is also subject to tax and reported on the foreign corporation's income
                           tax return, Form 1120-F. See Instructions for Form 1120-F for more information. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no treaty provision that reduces the rate of withholding on branch interest, you must withhold tax under
                           chapter 3 at the statutory rate of 30% on the interest paid by a foreign corporation's U.S. trade or business and you must
                           withhold under chapter 4 when otherwise applicable and without regard to a treaty provision. 
                           <p></p>

                        <p>In general, payees of interest from a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation are entitled to reduced rates of, or
                           exemption from, tax under a treaty in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as if they had received the interest
                           from a domestic corporation. However, a foreign corporation that receives interest paid by a U.S. trade or business of a foreign
                           corporation also must be a qualified resident of its country of residence to be entitled to benefits under that country's
                           tax treaty. If the payee foreign corporation is a resident of a country that has entered into an income tax treaty since 1987
                           that contains a limitation on benefits article, the foreign corporation need only satisfy the limitation on benefits article
                           in that treaty to qualify for a reduced rate of tax. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Alternatively, a payee may be entitled to treaty benefits under the payer's treaty if there is a provision in that treaty
                           that applies specifically to interest paid by the payer foreign corporation. This provision may exempt all or a part of this
                           interest. Some treaties provide for an exemption regardless of the payee's residence or citizenship, while others provide
                           for an exemption according to the payee's status as a resident or citizen of the payer's country. 
                        </p>
                        <p>A foreign corporation that pays interest must be a qualified resident (under section 884 of the Internal Revenue Code) of
                           its country of residence for the payer's treaty to exempt payments from tax by the foreign corporation. However, if the foreign
                           corporation is a resident of a country that has entered into an income tax treaty since 1987 that contains a limitation on
                           benefits article, the foreign corporation need only satisfy the limitation on benefits article in that treaty to qualify for
                           the exemption.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, the domestic corporation determines its active foreign business income by combining its income and
                           the income of any subsidiary in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the stock. However, if the testing period
                           includes one or more tax years beginning before January 1, 2011, the corporation can use only its gross income for any tax
                           year beginning before January 1, 2011, and will meet the 80% test if the weighted average percentage of active foreign business
                           income is more than 80%.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The active foreign business percentage is found by dividing the corporation&#8217;s active foreign business income for the
                           testing period by the corporation&#8217;s total gross income for that period. The testing period is the 3 tax years before the year
                           in which the dividends are declared (or shorter period if the corporation was not in existence for 3 years). If the corporation
                           has no gross income for that 3-year period, the testing period is the tax year in which the dividend is paid.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A treaty may reduce the rate of withholding on dividends from that which generally applies under the treaty if the
                           shareholder owns a certain percentage of the voting stock of the corporation when withholding under chapter 4 does not apply.
                           In most cases, this preferential rate applies only if the shareholder directly owns the required percentage, although some
                           treaties permit the percentage to be met by direct or indirect ownership. The preferential rate may apply to the payment of
                           a deemed dividend under section 304(a)(1) of the Code. Under some treaties, the preferential rate for dividends qualifying
                           for the direct dividend rate applies only if no more than a certain percentage of the paying corporation's gross income for
                           a certain period consists of dividends and interest other than dividends and interest from subsidiaries or from the active

                           are attributable to any earnings and profits when the branch profits tax is prohibited by a tax treaty.

                           rates to the part of a distribution that arises from the performance of services in the United States after December 31, 1986.

                           available to provide benefits to any participant. If the distribution is from such a plan, you can use the method in Revenue

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign pension plans are exempt from applying withholding under chapter 4 when they are exempt beneficial owners

                           attach a statement to the annual Form W-4 indicating that the individual has filed a U.S. income tax return for the previous

                           to be in the United States during the year. The prorated exemption amount should be shown on line A of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Personal Allowances Worksheet </em></span>that comes with Form W-4. See Publication 519 for the current year daily exemption amount.

                        30% rate on compensation you pay to a nonresident alien individual for labor or personal services performed in the United
                        States, unless that pay is specifically exempted from withholding or subject to graduated withholding. This rule applies regardless
                        of your place of residence, the place where the contract for service was made, or the place of payment. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Payments for personal services are not withholdable payments under chapter 4 when they are nonfinancial payments. See Treasury
                        regulations section 1.1473-1(a)(4)(iii) for a description of these payments and their exclusion as withholdable payments.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers who are illegal aliens are subject to U.S. taxes in spite of their illegal status. U.S. employers
                        or payers who hire illegal aliens may be subject to various fines, penalties, and sanctions imposed by U.S. Immigration and
                        Customs Enforcement. If such employers or payers choose to hire illegal aliens, the payments made to those aliens are subject
                        to the same tax withholding and reporting obligations that apply to other classes of aliens. Illegal aliens who are nonresident
                        aliens and who receive income from performing independent personal services are subject to 30% withholding unless exempt under
                        some provision of law or a tax treaty. Illegal aliens who are resident aliens and who receive income from performing dependent
                        personal services are subject to the same reporting and withholding obligations that apply to U.S. citizens who receive the
                        same kind of income.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp; Independent personal services (a term commonly used in tax treaties) are personal services performed by an independent
                        nonresident alien contractor as contrasted with those performed by an employee. This category of pay includes payments for
                        professional services, such as fees of an attorney, physician, or accountant made directly to the person performing the services.
                        It also includes honoraria paid by colleges and universities to visiting teachers, lecturers, and researchers.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Pay for independent personal services is subject to chapter 3 withholding and reporting as follows.
                        <p></p>

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;You must withhold at the statutory rate of 30% on all payments unless the alien enters into a withholding agreement
                        or receives a final payment exemption (discussed later).
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of pay subject to 30% withholding may be reduced by the personal exemption amount if the alien gives you
                        a properly completed Form 8233. A nonresident alien is allowed only one personal exemption. However, individuals who are residents
                        of Canada, Mexico, or South Korea, or are U.S. nationals generally are entitled to the same exemptions as U.S. citizens. See
                        Publication 519 for the current year personal exemption amounts.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Students and business apprentices covered by Article 21(2) of the United States-India income tax treaty may claim
                        an additional exemption for their spouse if a joint return is not filed, and if the spouse has no gross income for the year
                        and is not the dependent of another taxpayer. They also may claim additional exemptions for children who reside with them
                        in the United States at any time during the year, but only if the dependents are U.S. citizens or nationals or residents of
                        the United States, Canada, or Mexico. They may not claim exemptions for dependents who are admitted to the United States on

                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Each allowable exemption must be prorated according to the number of days during the tax year during which the alien
                        performs services in the United States. Multiply the number of these days by the daily exemption amount to figure the prorated
                        amount. Residents of South Korea must make a further proration of their additional exemptions based on their gross income
                        effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. The rules for this proration are discussed in detail in Publication 519.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Under other tax treaties, pay for independent personal services performed in the United States is exempt from U.S.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Often, you must withhold under the statutory rules on payments made to a treaty country resident contractor for services
                        performed in the United States. This is because the factors on which the treaty exemption is based may not be determinable
                        until after the close of the tax year. The contractor must then file a U.S. income tax return (Form 1040NR) to recover any
                        overwithheld tax by providing the IRS with proof that he or she is entitled to a treaty exemption.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;For pay for personal services to qualify as wages, there must be an employer-employee relationship. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Under the common law rules, every individual who performs services subject to the will and control of an employer,
                           both as to what shall be done and how it shall be done, is an employee. It does not matter that the employer allows the employee
                           considerable discretion and freedom of action, as long as the employer has the legal right to control both the method and
                           the result of the services. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If an employer-employee relationship exists, it does not matter what the parties call the relationship. It does not
                           matter if the employee is called a partner, coadventurer, agent, or independent contractor. It does not matter how the pay
                           is measured, how the individual is paid, or what the payments are called. Nor does it matter whether the individual works
                           full-time or part-time. 
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of the employer-employee relationship under the usual common law rules will be determined, in doubtful

                           religious and charitable organizations, educational institutions, clubs, social organizations, and societies. It also includes

                                       not engaged in trade or business in the United States (including Puerto Rico as if a part of the United States), and 
                                    </p>
                                 </li>

                                    <p>An employer includes any person who has control of the payment of wages for services that are performed for another person
                                       who does not have that control.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a trust pays wages, such as certain types of pensions, supplemental unemployment pay, or retired pay,
                           and the person for whom the services were performed has no legal control over the payment of the wages, the trust is the employer.
                           
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;These special definitions have no effect upon the relationship between an alien employee and the actual employer when
                           determining whether the pay received is considered to be wages.

                        <p>If an employer-employee relationship exists, the employer ordinarily must withhold the income tax from wage payments by using

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Nonresident alien entertainers and athletes who perform or participate in events in the United States can request
                        a CWA for a lower rate of withholding. A CWA is an agreement entered into by the athlete or entertainer, a designated withholding
                        agent, and the IRS. Under no circumstances will a CWA reduce taxes withheld to less than the anticipated amount of income
                        tax liability.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Nonresident alien entertainers or athletes requesting a CWA must submit a written application and appropriate attachments.
                        Use Form 13930, Application for Central Withholding Agreement, and its instructions to apply for a CWA.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The designated withholding agent must agree to withhold income tax from payments made to the nonresident alien, to
                        pay over the withheld tax to the IRS on the dates and in the amounts specified in the agreement, and to have the IRS apply
                        the payments of withheld tax to the withholding agent's Form 1042 account. The designated withholding agent will be required
                        to file Form 1042 and Form 1042-S for each tax year in which income is paid to a nonresident alien covered by the CWA. The
                        designated withholding agent will issue Form 1042-S to each nonresident alien athlete and entertainer affected by the agreement.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Employees and independent contractors may claim an exemption from withholding under a tax treaty by filing Form 8233.
                        Often, however, you will have to withhold at the statutory rates on the total payments to the entertainer or athlete. This
                        is because the exemption may be based upon factors that cannot be determined until after the end of the year.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. source gross transportation income (USSGTI), as defined in section 887, is not subject to  30% gross withholding

                        aircraft, whether owned, hired, or leased, or from the performance of services directly related to the use of a vessel or
                        aircraft. U.S. source gross transportation income includes 50% of all transportation income from transportation that either
                        begins or ends in the United States. USSGTI does not include transportation income of a foreign corporation taxable in a U.S.
                        possession. The recipient of USSGTI must pay tax on it annually at the rate of 4% on Section I of Form 1120-F, unless the
                        income is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and is reportable on Section II of Form 1120-F.

                     (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(18) of the Code) is not subject to chapter 3 withholding. International organizations
                     are not required to provide a Form W-8 or documentary evidence to receive the exemption if the name of the payee is one that
                     is designated as an international organization by executive order. 
                     <p></p>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;Payments made to an international organization, as defined for chapter 4 purposes, are not payments to which chapter
                     4 withholding applies. An international organization for purposes of chapter 4 means any entity described in section 7701(a)(18)
                     of the Code. The term also includes any intergovernmental or supranational organization that is comprised primarily of foreign
                     governments, that is recognized as an intergovernmental or supranational organization under certain foreign laws or that has
                     in effect a headquarters agreement with a foreign government, and whose income does not inure to the benefit of private persons.
                     See Treasury regulations section 1.1471-3(d)(9) for the documentation required to establish an entity&#8217;s chapter 4 status as

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;A foreign organization that is a tax exempt organization under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code is not
                     subject to a withholding tax on amounts that are not income includible under section 512 of the Internal Revenue Code as unrelated
                     business taxable income. In addition, withholdable payments made to a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c) of the
                     Internal Revenue Code are not payments to which chapter 4 withholding applies.
                     <p></p>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a foreign organization is a foreign private foundation, it is subject to a 4% withholding tax on all U.S.
                     source investment income. For a foreign tax-exempt organization to claim an exemption from withholding under chapter 3 or
                     4 because of its tax exempt status under section 501(c), or to claim withholding at a 4% rate, it must provide you with a
                     Form W-8EXP. However, if a foreign organization is claiming an exemption from withholding under an income tax treaty, or the
                     income is unrelated business taxable income, the organization must provide a Form W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI. Income paid to foreign
                     tax-exempt organizations is subject to reporting on Form 1042-S. If the organization is a partner in a partnership carrying
                     on a trade or business in the United States, the effectively connected income allocable to the organization is subject to
                     withholding under section 1446.

                     is made. A payment is not considered unexpected solely because the amount of the payment is not fixed.

                     <p>Mary, a citizen and resident of Ireland, visits the United States and wins $5,000 playing a slot machine in a casino. Under
                        the treaty with Ireland, the winnings are not subject to U.S. tax. Mary claims the treaty benefits by providing a Form W-8BEN
                        to the casino upon winning at the slot machine. However, she does not have an ITIN or foreign TIN. The casino is an acceptance
                        agent that can request an ITIN on an expedited basis.

                     <p>Situation 1. Assume that Mary won the money on Sunday. Since the IRS does not issue ITINs on Sunday, the casino can pay $5,000
                        to Mary without withholding U.S. tax. The casino must, on the following Monday, fax a completed Form W-7 for Mary, including
                        the required certification, to the IRS for an expedited ITIN.
                     </p>
                     <p>Situation 2. Assume that Mary won the money on Monday. To pay the winnings without withholding U.S. tax, the casino must apply
                        for and get an ITIN for Mary because an expedited ITIN is available from the IRS at the time of the payment.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Under certain circumstances, a withholding agent may be permitted to set aside a withheld amount in escrow rather
                        than depositing the tax. A participating FFI that withholds tax on a withholdable payment not otherwise subject to chapter
                        3 withholding or backup withholding under section 3406 made to a recalcitrant account holder of a dormant account may, in
                        lieu of depositing the tax withheld, set aside the amount withheld in escrow until the date that the account ceases to be
                        a dormant account. In such case, the tax withheld becomes due 90 days following the date that the account ceases to be a dormant
                        account if the account holder does not provide the required documentation, or becomes refundable to the account holder if
                        the account holder provides documentation establishing that withholding does not apply. A withholding agent that withholds
                        tax under chapter 3 on certain payments that include an undetermined amount of income may retain 30 percent of the payment
                        to hold in escrow in accordance with Treasury regulations section 1.1441-3(d). Similarly, if a withholding agent is unable
                        to determine whether the payment is a withholdable payment because the source or character of the payment is unknown, the
                        withholding agent may retain 30 percent of the payment to hold in escrow for chapter 4 purposes in accordance with Treasury
                        regulations section 1.1471-2(a)(5).

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;You must deposit all withheld taxes under chapter 3 or 4 by electronic funds transfer. In most cases, electronic funds
                        transfers are made using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). If you do not want to use EFTPS, you can arrange
                        for your tax professional, financial institution, or other trusted third party to make deposits on your behalf. Also, you
                        may arrange for your financial institution to initiate a same-day wire payment on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided
                        by the Department of Treasury. Services provided by your tax professional, financial institution, or other third party may
                        have a fee.

                        to deposit was for reasonable cause and not because of willful neglect. Also, the IRS may waive the penalty if certain requirements

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;James Smith is a resident of the United Kingdom. In December 2015, domestic corporation M paid a dividend of $100
                        to James, at which time M withheld $30 under chapter 3 and paid the balance of $70 to him. In February 2016, James gave M
                        a valid Form W-8BEN. He advises M that under the income tax convention with the United Kingdom, only $15 should have been
                        withheld from the dividend and requests repayment of the $15 overwithheld. Although M Corporation had already deposited the
                        $30, the corporation repaid James $15 before the end of February.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;During 2015, M made no other payments from which tax had to be withheld. On its timely filed 2015 Form 1042, M reports
                        $15 as its total tax liability and $30 as its total deposits. M requests that the $15 overpayment be credited to its 2016
                        Form 1042 rather than refunded. 
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The Form 1042-S that M files for the dividend paid to James in 2015 must show a tax withheld of $30 in boxes 7 and
                        10 and $15 as an amount repaid in box 11. The Form 1042-S must show an exemption code in box 4a for an exemption from chapter

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2016, M made payments from which it withheld tax of $200. On July 15, 2016, M deposited $185, that is, $200
                        less the $15 credit claimed on its Form 1042 for 2015. M timely filed its Form 1042 for 2016, showing tax liability of $200,

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If you discover after March 15 of the following calendar year that you overwithheld tax for the prior year, do not
                        adjust the amount of tax reported on Forms 1042-S (and Form 1042) or on any deposit or payment for that prior year. Do not
                        repay the beneficial owner or payee the amount overwithheld unless you are a withholding agent for the payment that is a QI,
                        WP, WT, or participating FFI that is eligible to file a collective refund on behalf of one or more of its account holders,
                        partners, beneficiaries, or owners (as applicable). See the applicable agreement of each such entity for details on the requirements
                        for a collective refund.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation (other than a collective refund filed by the withholding agent), the recipient will have to file
                        a U.S. income tax return (Form 1040NR, Form 1040NR-EZ, or Form 1120-F) to claim a refund or credit or, if a tax return has
                        already been filed, a claim for refund (Form 1040X or amended Form 1120-F) to recover the amount overwithheld. See Treasury
                        regulations section 1.1474-5 for the specific requirements that apply to obtain a credit or refund of tax actually withheld
                        under chapter 4. As described in Notice 2015-10, 2015-20 I.R.B. 965, the IRS intends to issue regulations providing that an
                        otherwise allowable claim for refund or credit made by a claimant that is the beneficial owner of a withheld payment is only
                        available to the extent that the relevant withholding agent deposited the amount withheld.

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;Every U.S. and foreign withholding agent must file a Form 1042-S for amounts subject to chapter 3 withholding and
                     chapter 4 reportable amounts unless an exception applies. The form can be filed electronically or on paper. A separate Form
                     1042-S is required for each recipient of income to whom you made payments during the preceding calendar year regardless of
                     whether you withheld or were required to withhold tax. However, if you make a withholdable payment to a nonqualified intermediary
                     or a flow-through entity that is allocable to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool as indicated on a withholding statement upon
                     which you may rely with respect to the payment allocable to such a pool, you should complete a separate Form 1042-S for each
                     chapter 4 withholding rate pool (i.e., pool of recalcitrant account holders, pool of nonparticipating FFIs, pool of payees
                     that are U.S. persons), treating the intermediary or flow-through entity as the recipient (and the applicable pool as the
                     chapter 4 status of the recipient). You need not issue a Form 1042-S to each recipient included in such pool. You must use
                     a separate Form 1042-S for each type of income that you paid to the same recipient. See <a name="en_US_2016_publink1000256721" href="ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000225061" title="Statements to recipients.">

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;You must furnish a Form 1042-S for each recipient even if you did not withhold tax because you repaid the tax withheld
                     to the recipient or because the income payment was exempt from tax under the Internal Revenue Code or under a U.S. income
                     tax treaty (except for a withholdable payment that is not a chapter 4 reportable amount).

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use a substitute Form 1042-S if it meets the requirements listed in Publication 1179. Paper substitutes that

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;If you are reporting amounts withheld by another withholding agent, Form 1042-S requests the name and EIN of the withholding
                     agent that withheld the tax to the extent required in the Instructions to Form 1042-S. This information is required for amounts

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;You must furnish a statement to each recipient for whom you are filing a Form 1042-S by the due date for filing Forms
                     1042 and 1042-S with the IRS. You may use a copy of the official Form 1042-S for this purpose. Any substitute forms must comply
                     with the rules set out in Publication 1179. You must furnish a separate substitute Form 1042-S for each type of income or
                     payment. The withholding agent must ensure that any substitute Form 1042-S Copy B, C, and D, which are provided to the recipient,
                     conforms in format and size to the official Form 1042-S and contains the exact same information as the copy filed with the
                     IRS or submitted electronically. However, the size of a substitute Form 1042-S, Copy B, C, and D, may be adjusted if the substitute
                     form is presented on a landscape oriented page instead of portrait. Only one Form 1042-S may be submitted per page, regardless
                     of orientation.

                        to file that form.  You should request an extension as soon as you are aware that an extension is necessary, but no later
                        than the due date for filing Form 8966. Under certain hardship conditions, the IRS may grant an additional 90-day extension
                        to file Form 8966. To request an additional 90-day extension of time to file Form 8966, file a second Form 8809-I before the
                        end of the initial extended due date.

                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A foreign partner may submit a Form 8804-C to a partnership at any time during the partnership's year and prior to
                           the partnership's filing of its Form 8804. An updated certificate is required when the facts or representations made in the

                           payment is the sum of the installment payments for each of its foreign partners. The amount of each installment payment can
                           be figured by using Form 8804-W.

                           the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th months of its tax year for U.S. income tax purposes. Any additional amounts due are to be paid

                           the installment payment date. No particular form is required for this notification. For more information on the substance

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Form 8805 is used to show the amount of effectively connected taxable income and any withholding tax payments allocable
                           to a foreign partner for the partnership's tax year. At the end of the partnership's tax year, Form 8805 must be sent to each
                           foreign partner on whose behalf section 1446 tax was withheld or whose Form 8804-C the partnership considered, whether or
                           not any withholding tax is paid. It must be delivered to the foreign partner by the due date of the partnership return (including
                           extensions). A copy of Form 8805 for each foreign partner also must be attached to Form 8804 when it is filed. Also attach
                           the most recent Form 8804-C, discussed earlier, to the Form 8805 filed for the partnership's tax year in which the Form 8804-C
                           was considered.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of Form 8805 must be attached to the foreign partner's U.S. income tax return to take a credit on its Form
                           1040NR or Form 1120-F.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The withholding agent under this section can be the PTP or a nominee. For this purpose, a nominee is a domestic person
                        that holds an interest in a PTP on behalf of a foreign person. The nominee is treated as the withholding agent only to the
                        extent of the amount specified in the qualified notice given to the nominee by the PTP. If a nominee is designated as the
                        withholding agent, the obligation to withhold is imposed solely on the nominee. The nominee must report the distributions
                        and withheld amounts on Forms 1042 and 1042-S. For more information, see Regulations section 1.1446-4(b) and (d).

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The partnership or nominee must withhold tax on any actual distributions of money or property to foreign partners.
                        The amount of the distribution includes the amount of any section 1446 tax required to be withheld. In the case of a partnership
                        that receives a partnership distribution from another partnership (a tiered partnership), the distribution also includes the
                        tax withheld from that distribution. 
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If the distribution is in property other than money, the partnership cannot release the property until it has enough
                        funds to pay over the withholding tax.

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;A distribution by a QIE to a nonresident alien or foreign corporation that is treated as gain from the sale or exchange
                     of a U.S. real property interest by the shareholder is subject to withholding at 35%. 
                     <p></p>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain exceptions apply to the look-through rule for distributions by QIEs. Any distribution by a QIE with respect
                     to stock regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States is not treated as gain from the sale or
                     exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder did not own more than 5% of that stock (or more than 10% of that
                     stock in the case of REITs) at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of the distribution. A distribution by
                     a REIT generally is not treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if the shareholder is a
                     qualified shareholder (as described in section 897(k)(3)). These distributions may be included in the shareholder's gross
                     income as a dividend from the QIE, not as long-term capital gain.

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of an interest in a domestically controlled QIE is not the sale of a U.S. real property interest. The entity
                     is domestically controlled if at all times during the testing period less than 50% in value of its stock was held, directly
                     or indirectly, by foreign persons. The testing period is the shorter of (a) the 5-year period ending on the date of disposition,
                     or (b) the period during which the entity was in existence.

                                 that would have been treated by the shareholder as gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest; and

                              <p>Acquires, or enters into a contract or option to acquire, a substantially identical interest in that entity during the 61-day
                                 period that began on the first day of the 30-day period.

                     </div>If this occurs, the shareholder is treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest in an
                     amount equal to the distribution that would have been treated as such gain. This also applies to any substitute dividend payment.
                     No withholding is required on these transactions.
