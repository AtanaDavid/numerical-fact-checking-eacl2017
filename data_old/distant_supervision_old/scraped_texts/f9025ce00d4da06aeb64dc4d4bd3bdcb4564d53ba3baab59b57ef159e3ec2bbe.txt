Video of the Loon Copter for the 2016 Drones for Good Competition. The Loon Copter was selected as 1 of 10 semifinalist in the international category. The competition had received 1017 entries from 165 countries.
The Loon Copter submarine drone project started in 2014 at Oakland University and is the first multi-rotor drone to successfully demonstrate flight, operation on the surface of water, as well as diving.
This is a proof-of-concept prototype and there is still a lot of work to be done. We are looking into extended wireless range underwater, navigation underwater, a redesign of the hull for more efficient diving, payloads for different applications, etc. If you like to support this project, please "like" the Loon Copter on the semifinalists webpage here:
