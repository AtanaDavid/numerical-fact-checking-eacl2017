Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is a fourth iteration of the Surface line that’s hot right now. Arguably, some say the device is a tablet while many love to call it a laptop.
Precisely, it’s a hybrid version of both that champions the concept of a ‘laplet’. An excellent take on a laptop and tablet, the Surface Pro 4 is a winner in every aspect. Read to know why.
The Pro 4 shares identical looks with the Pro 3 and it’s got an all-magnesium unibody casing. It has a kickstand at the back fitted to a microSD slot within. Check out its external configuration that features USB 3 slot, power socket, mini DisplayPort, and docking, reports Recombu.
Compared to the previous model, the surface Pro 4 boasts of some aesthetic details such as a larger display at 12.3-inches, up from 12-inches and thinner bezels on the outline. Though the Surface Pro 4 is touted as the slimmest and thinnest laplet model (786 grams, 8.4 mm), the Sony’s Xperia Z4 (393 g, 6.1 mm) and iPad Air 2 (437 g, 6.1mm) are much more tablet-like, reports Forbes.
The model comes loaded with 2160 x 1440 to 2736 x 1824 pixels per inch.  Compared to its predecessor, the Pro 4 display is much brighter and has enhanced colour accuracy. Therefore, artists and film lovers will have a fabulous time with their creativity and entertainment with the tablet.
Indeed, you can manifest your skills with a Surface pen that has up to 1024 levels of pressure, which is four times more than the Pro 3 Pen. True, the pen is a pleasure to use and it’s got an eraser on the top.
In every aspect, the laplet is a winner and steals the show with lots of surprises.
