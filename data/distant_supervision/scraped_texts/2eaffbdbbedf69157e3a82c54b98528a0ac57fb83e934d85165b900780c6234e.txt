At present, England has 164 grammar schools and Northern Ireland has 69. Our  primary purpose is the preservation of these excellent state schools, all of  which face threats from various quarters. Our secondary purpose is to encourage  the formation of more grammar schools, especially in areas of the country where  none currently exist.
Through factual information and reasoned argument, we regularly contribute  to the debate about the future of our schools, both nationally and locally. So  please continue to use this website as a central information point for  questions about grammar schools.
In the meantime, please explore the arguments for grammar schools by using  the links on the left and below.
Above all, please keep us informed.
