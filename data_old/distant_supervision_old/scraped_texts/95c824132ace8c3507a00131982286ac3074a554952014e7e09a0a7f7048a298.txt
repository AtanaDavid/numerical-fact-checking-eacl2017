Syracuse, N.Y. â€” Kenardo Forbes scored three times and Nate Bourdeau and Slavisa Ubiparipovic each tallied twice to spark the Syracuse Silver Knights past the Detroit Waza Flo 9-4 on Friday at the War Memorial.
Garrett Losee and Domenico Vitale also scored for Syracuse, which evened its record at 1-1. Attendance was announced as 3,279 in the home opener for the Silver Knights..
Syracuse goalie Bryan O'Quinn made several acrobatic saves in the fourth and Vitale and Ubiparipovic each scored during that stretch to salt the game away.
Vitale cranked a long shot past Waza Flo goalie Trent Messick with 6:58 left to inflate Syracuse's lead to 8-4, and Ubiparipovic closed the scoring on a penalty kick with 2:39 remaining.
Ubiparipovic put an exclamation point in the third quarter to push the Silver Knights ahead 7-4. Ubiparipovic found open space on the right side and then curled a low shot past Messick and inside the right post.
That answered two straight scores from Detroit, by Costea Decu and Leonardo de Oliveira, that had inched the visitors within 6-4.
The Silver Knights padded a two-goal halftime edge with a pair of quick scores early in the third.
Forbes kissed in an easy rebound into an open left side just 1:10 in to make it 5-2 Syracuse, and 58 ticks later Bourdeau slammed in a rebound for a four-score cushion.
The teams combined for all their first-half scoring in the opening quarter, after which Syracuse led 4-2.
Losee broke a 2-2 tie with 4:11 remaining when he took a crossing feed on the left side from Bo Jelovac and redirected it into the back of the Waza Flo goal.
Just over a minute later, Forbes bounded a bouncing ball into the left side for a 4-2 Syracuse cushion.
