<h3>Advice</h3>
<p>BNY Mellon does not offer investment advice on the merits or suitability of its products and no information contained within this Site should be construed as such. No warranty is given in relation to any information or advice, whether oral or written, obtained from BNY Mellon through this Site or otherwise.</p>
<p>BNY Mellon only provides information about its own products and services and does not give investment advice based on individual circumstances. BNY Mellon believes that it is important that any investments you make are suitable for your needs. Therefore we recommend that prior to making an investment into any of our products you consult with a professional financial adviser who will be able to consider your particular investment and help you to determine which is most appropriate for your circumstances.</p>
<h3>Taxation</h3>
<p>BNY Mellon does not provide tax advice. Except where stated otherwise, the contents of this Site are based on BNY Mellon&#8217;s interpretation of United Kingdom taxation law and practice as at the date appearing at the foot of each product fact sheet. While we believe this interpretation is correct as at the relevant date, we can give no guarantee that tax reliefs and the tax treatment of funds will remain the same in the future. The value of any tax reliefs will depend on individual financial circumstances and the country of residence of the relevant investor. If you are in any doubt, you are advised to consult your professional financial and tax advisers.</p>
