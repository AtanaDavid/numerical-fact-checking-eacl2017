Overall year result and module marks (and for final year students your degree classification) will be emailed to students' University email accounts on Monday 03 July 2017. All results emails will be delivered by 1.00pm. On the same day students will be able to check their results through Liverpool Life from 5pm.  It is your responsibility to obtain your result/marks/ classification.
Log on to Liverpool Life as normal, click on the 'Academic' tab, and click the Second Semester 'Click Here' button in the Results portlet.
Students not in their final year who fail to progress to the next year of study will be required to re-take all modules in which they obtain less than 40%. Find out more about progression.
After the re-sit examinations in August 2017, marks will be emailed to students on Friday 08 September 2017.  All results emails will be delivered to students' University email accounts across the morning of the 08 September  2017.  This process takes a number of hours before all students will be in receipt of their own personal results email, and so you can still expect to receive one up to 1.00pm.
Results will also be available in Liverpool Life by the end of the day on Friday 08 September 2017.
Log on to Liverpool Life as normal, click on the 'Academic' tab, and click the Overall Results 'Click Here' button in the Results outlet.
Module marks and overall results will be emailed to students' University email accounts by 5pm on 22 November 2016. On the same day, students will be able to check their results through Liverpool Life from 5pm.
