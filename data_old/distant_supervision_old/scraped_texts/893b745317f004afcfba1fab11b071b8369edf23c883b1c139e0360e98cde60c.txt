90+1 min Murphy has the ball 20 yards out, attempts to curl it into the far corner but fails to get any bend on his effort and it doesn't threaten Vorm's goal.
90 min Three minutes of added time. You know what I said about Spurs scoring two more? Forget that.
89 min Campbell-Ryce has done nothing but impress tonight. He turns one way, then the other, then back again, then the other before the ball is delivered deep to an unmarked Murphy only for Walker to just about guide it away from the Sheffield United man with the very tip of his head. A crucial interception.
86 min Campbell-Ryce has been quiet this half but the winger steals the ball off Davies, knocks it past Dembele and surges up the field to create a dangerous Sheffield United counter-attack. His attempted cross is knocked out for a corner by Vertonghen but the set piece comes to nothing. A rare glimmer of hope for the visitors. Off goes Scougall for Wallace.
83 min SheffU substitution: Baxter on for McNulty. Not the best gig the lone striker has ever been handed.
82 min Here comes Kane. The England striker-in-waiting shows the full extent of his tricks and pace as he aims straight at goal but Basham shepherds him out with some quite super defending. Possession stats in the last 10 mins are Spurs 85%, Sheffield United 15%.
79 min Boy have Nigel Clough's side started to run out of steam. I suppose it is to be expected from a League One side up against a side of Spurs' quality. I wouldn't be surprised if the hosts stick another couple past Howard.
75 min On comes Paulinho for Stambouli in Spurs's final substitution of the night and the home side are now piling on the pressure.
GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Sheffield United (Townsend) The spotkick is struck well but nowhere near the corner and Howard will be disappointed not to keep it out.
72 min PENALTY! A stunning dinked ball forward from Vertonghen finds Soldado who controls with aplomb and forces McEveley to inadvertently punch the ball behind as he charges back. There can be - and indeed there are - few complaints about that. As blatant a handball as you are ever likely to see.
70 min Here comes Eriksen as Spurs come forward four-on-four. The Dane finds Soldado and then Townsend whose shot is deflected wide. The resulting corner is played short to Kane to unleashes his fury on a shot that fails to reach the goalkeeper as it is halted by a packed United defence inside the six-yard box.
68 min I'd argue it still is pretty dull...
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Ben Pearce - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23thfc" target="_blank"&gt;#thfc&lt;/a&gt; This would be a really boring game if it wasn't so important.&lt;/noframe&gt;
67 min Sheffield United are having so little possession but they have another corner after Murphy's shot is deflected wide. It's positions like these that offer the League One side most hope of scoring... so Murphy scuffs his delivery straight out of play.
64 min That's the end of Adebayor who departs, to more than a handful of boos, for Soldado. Debele replaces Mason.
63 min It looks like it might be Soldado and Dembele time. Spurs have a corner after a decent enough Townsend cross is turned behind. Eriksen goes for the whip but only succeeds in smashing the ball out of play.
60 min We have a flare in the Sheffield United end!
58 min Spurs come forward, Sheffu intercept, Spurs win the ball back and come forward, Sheffu intercept. And repeat. And repeat.
57 min The home side are starting to win possession back increasingly cheaply to produce wave after wave of attack... which come to nothing over and over again.
55 min McEveley, having been fortunate to con the referee only a moment ago, pleads innocence after hacking Townsend down with the most League One of League One tackles but this time the referee gets his decision correct and shows the Sheffield United man a yellow card. Alas the freekick comes to nothing for Spurs.
53 min Now Spurs have a corner of their own and White Hart Lane raises its voice as one in a bid to urge the home side forward. McEveley heads the ball behind for a second corner... and the referee awards a goal kick. Whoops.
49 min ...Reed takes it, the ball is headed as far as Doyle on the edge of the penalty area where the United No 8 lumps it a long way over the bar.
48 min Sheffield United have been admirably organised when Spurs are in possession and Nigel Clough will be extremely happy with proceedings so far. Murphy wins a corner off the boot of Walker (has anyone mentioned he supports United?)...
46 min No half-time changes as Spurs get us underway for the second half. I wonder if Kane will be moved higher up the pitch to support Adebayor.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Henry Winter - 0-0 ht. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23thfc" target="_blank"&gt;#thfc&lt;/a&gt; lack precision/urgency. Need Kane central. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23sufc" target="_blank"&gt;#sufc&lt;/a&gt; organised, undaunted, Campbell-Ryce troubling Davies &amp;amp; backed by loud support&lt;/noframe&gt;
Half time Just one shot on target in the opening 45 minutes then and that was a header from Spurs centre-back Dier. There is nothing like the margin between these two sides that exists on paper. Campbell-Ryce has caused at least three problems for the visitors who are so far repelling what little Spurs are throwing at them. Pochettino will expect far more in the second half.
45 min Two minutes of added time to play. The home side are having a decent spell to end the half but Sheffield United are defending with all their might. Dier again rises highest to head a set piece although his nod trickles wide.
44 min Davies is having a game to forget defensively at the moment but now he finds himself at the other end of the pitch. The Spurs full-back pulls the ball back into the heart of the Sheffield United penalty area where it is hoofed to safety.
Meanwhile Murphy has a nose ouch and has stuck two rolled up bits of bog roll up his nostrils to relieve the pain.
40 min Oooh so close to an opening goal from Scougall. Reed wins the ball high up the field after some dilly-dallying from Davies. The United midfielder squares to Scougall who lashes a first-time effort just wide of the Spurs goal.
36 min Superb intervention from Dier sees Spurs launch a counter-attack and Eriksen instantly pings a long-ball over the United defence to Adebayor. The captain just about brings the ball down travelling over his head, but he is unable to keep his shot down. A big let off for the sleeping Sheffield United defence.
32 min Campbell-Ryce has got serious gas to burn down the right for Sheffield United. The winger keeps finding himself one-on-one with Davies and is able to beat his opposite number for pace every time. This time he wins a corner that is headed safely away. The League One side are holding their own considering the huge difference in league positions between the two sides.
30 min Tottenham are starting to enjoy more of the ball now but they aren't having much luck breaking the visitors down.
28 min Townsend, of shooting-from-long-range fame, decides to shoot from long range and squirts his limp effort dribbling well wide.
Both managers are having a whale of a time:
24 min Crucial save! Townsend delivers a Spurs free-kick from the right, Dier is allowed to rise unchallenged at the near post and the Spurs centre-back connects well with his header only for Howard to palm it away. Both sides have had their best chances in the space of two minutes.
23 min Straight down the other end go Sheffield United and Campbell-Ryce whips a lethal low cross across the face of goal and only about a metre past the far post. If only someone had been gambling on his delivery.
21 min Finally it looks like there might something of interest at White Hart Lane. Eriksen unleashes Townsend down the right on the counter-attack and the one-time England saviour tumbles the floor under pressure from Harris. Referee's verdict: no foul.
20 min Cut Adebayor open and he bleeds the white of Spurs (which looks very similar to the white of Real Madrid - he enjoyed his time over in Spain).
18 min Oi, oi, what's happened here then? Chants of "off, off, off" from the away fans and Nigel Clough is furious after Scougall goes down under an Adebayor arm near the halfway line. Did the Spurs captain (*ahem) lead with the arm or was it an innocuous collision? Well replays show it could probably be interpreted either way and the referee decides to show Adebayor a yellow card. I'm inclined to say it was a flailing hand that happened to find Scougall's face but he was walking a tightrope there.
13 min Sheffield United are proving themselves to be far more of a threat than Spurs at the moment. Scougall brings the ball forward through the middle, lays off to McNulty whose shot is charged down and Vorm and co. can breathe a sigh of relief.
12 min Ah, so the Walker narrative is still going strong.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Simon Peach - "Kyle Walker, he wants us to win" chant the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23SUFC" target="_blank"&gt;#SUFC&lt;/a&gt; fans.&lt;/noframe&gt;
10 min A rare foray into the Sheffield United penalty area as Spurs win a corner kick. The ball finds Kane unmarked at the far post but the man of the moment shows he is human with an awful first touch and the chance fades.
7 min We have our first shot of the match. For the good of everyone watching let us hope things can only get better. Murphy lays the ball off to Doyle who smashes it so high it threatens to leave the stadium and travel down the high road.
5 min In fact the visitors are looking the sharper of the two sides. Perhaps they enjoyed a nap on the bus. Flynn capitalises on a loose pass among the Spurs defence and forces Vorm to scamper off his line and dive at the feet of the United midfielder.
3 min As expected Kane looks to have set up behind Adebayor with Eriksen out on the left for Spurs. The League One side have certainly matched their more illustrious opponents in the opening exchanges.
1 min We are underway and SheffU have a free-kick just five seconds into the match. The ball is worked out wide to Murphy who loops his cross far, long and out of play.
19.58 The players are shaking hands which means football is moments away.
19.55 Sheffield United's players doing a mighty fine impression of sixth formers lost on a school trip:
19.47 Mauricio Pochettino has also just been on. Asked to explain the decision to give Adebayor the captain's armband he offered this sparkling insight: "I need to pick the best team for every game and we decided to pick him. I think we will try to win the game and play better than Sheffield United."
19.42 Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough has been speaking ahead of kick-off. On traffic troubles: "I don't think it has affected us too much."
On their cup form that has seen them beat QPR, Southampton, West Ham, Fulham and Aston Villa over the past 12 months: "We have had our breaks in the cup games more than the league campaign so far. We've been difificult to beat and break down and we will need those things tonight."
19.36 Glenn Hoddle, how would you describe Pochettino's decision to give Adebayor the captaincy tonight?
"There's some friendly situations going on there".
Glenn, thanks for clearing that up for us.
19.35 The verdict in the Sky Sports studio is that Sheffield United may be more focused on traffic than football. The verdict from me is that they would be foolish to do so.
19.27 Our man at the ground today is none other than Henry Winter, who has provided this insight which has allowed me to put my GCSE matchs to good use and inform you that Sheffield United travelled to White Hart Lane at an average speed of 2mph.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Henry Winter - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23sufc" target="_blank"&gt;#sufc&lt;/a&gt; bus took two-and-a-half hours to do the 5 miles from their Islington hotel to White Hart Lane. Traffic bad - even by London standards.&lt;/noframe&gt;
19.21 Is this the stat that proves Adebayor will score today? (If you ever see a story with a question as a headline the answer is 99% "no". That logic applies here as well)
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: OptaJoe - 8 &amp;ndash; Eight of Emmanuel Adebayor&amp;rsquo;s last 10 goals for Tottenham (in all competitions) have come at White Hart Lane. Homely.&lt;/noframe&gt;
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Simon Peach - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23SUFC" target="_blank"&gt;#SUFC&lt;/a&gt; have belatedly arrived at White Hart Lane.&lt;/noframe&gt;
19.14 Let's talk teams. Aside from the Adebayor bombshell the other headlines from the Spurs camp are Lloris has been given the night off, Davies, Townsend and Mason all start, and Naughton is left out of the squad ahead of what looks like an impending move to Swansea.
There are three changes from the United team that lost against MK Dons on Saturday with Basham, Flynn and Reed all starting.
19.07 They still haven't arrived at White Hart Lane but here are the Sheffield United men who will be doing shuttle runs up and down the visitors' bus:
Sheffield United: Howard, Flynn, Basham, McEveley, Harris, Campbell-Ryce, Doyle, Reed, Murphy, Scougall, McNulty. Subs: Turner, Alcock, Baxter, Higdon, Kennedy, Adams, Wallace
19.02 BREAKING! The match has been put back to 8pm (at the earliest) because Sheffield United are... stuck in traffic.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Goodbrand Stats - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23thfc" target="_blank"&gt;#thfc&lt;/a&gt; Harry &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23kane" target="_blank"&gt;#kane&lt;/a&gt; has scored in all 3 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23LeagueCup" target="_blank"&gt;#LeagueCup&lt;/a&gt; matches for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23Tottenham" target="_blank"&gt;#Tottenham&lt;/a&gt; this season &amp;amp; in his last 4 apps in this competition. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23spurs" target="_blank"&gt;#spurs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23COYS" target="_blank"&gt;#COYS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
18.57 I'll bring you the Sheffield Utd team imminently but what do Spurs fans think of the decision to have this man leading the troops tonight? Booed on his last appearance at White Hart Lane and rewarded with the armband. Bold call from the gaffer. Get in touch on email or Twitter.
18.51 I usually refrain from capital letters but that's pretty special news. When I think of who I want in the trenches with me there is almost no one ahead of Emmanuel Adebayor. An inspiration to men, women, boys and girls around the world. Team player through and through. Spurs till he dies. That's the Tottenham skipper.
Tottenham: Vorm, Walker, Dier, Vertonghen, Davies, Townsend, Mason, Stambouli, Eriksen, Adebayor, Kane. Subs: Friedel, Kaboul, Rose, Dembele, Lennon, Paulinho, Soldado.
18.48 EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR IS SPURS CAPTAIN TONIGHT!
18.45 Good evening folks. I don't want to start on a gloomy note (because tonight's game could be pretty good) but when a match is being sold on the basis of Kyle Walker playing against a team he used to go and watch as a youngster it doesn't bode brilliantly...
But enough of that. Tonight has got giant-killing written all over it doesn't it? Actually how successful must a club be to warrant the tags of giants ready to be slain? Something to ponder...
Preview Blood is said to be thicker than water but that does not ring true for Kyle Walker, with the Tottenham right-back's own family hoping he slips up against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-finals.
Born and raised in the Steel City, the 24-year-old makes no secret of his Yorkshire roots and his love for the Blades, even going to Wembley last season to watch their FA Cup semi-final against Hull.
Walker spent many weekends as a child at Bramall Lane with his grandfather watching his idols Brian Deane and Peter Ndlovu, before stepping out on the hallowed turf himself.
The right-back remains a dyed-in-the-wool Blade despite only making a handful of appearances before leaving in 2009 for Spurs, who he will on Wednesday be hoping to help reach the Capital One Cup final at his boyhood club's expense.
"It's such an important game, especially for me," Walker said. "I have obviously supported the club since I was a boy and played for the club before I came here.
"I know their spirit and what the coaches will want. It's going to take a lot of hard work for us to get to Wembley."
This will be just the second time Walker has played United, having featured at Bramall Lane in an FA Cup third-round tie when on loan at Aston Villa four years ago.
"I played for my first game on loan for Aston Villa against United in the cup and scored," the right-back said. "Not only that but it was with my left foot.
"I think as a professional footballer you have to do your job. My heart will always be with Sheffield United but I am a Tottenham player and they are my club."
There are no such split loyalties for Walker's family, though.
"No (they won't be cheering me on) - they are Sheffield United fans," he said. "Seriously.
"They obviously support me and want me to do well, but they will be wanting Sheffield United to go through, although it is a bit of a win-win situation for them because either way they will go to Wembley."
Tottenham are overriding favourites for the two-legged semi-final, although they would be wise not get complacent against United.
The third-tier Blades have beaten five Premier League side since the start of 2014 and captain Michael Doyle believes they have "a brilliant chance" if the tie is still alive after the first leg.
"There's a lot to play for and I'm sure Tottenham will be fired up," Doyle said. "They'll look at our previous results and performances in other cup games and I'm sure they'll take note of that.
"They won't underestimate us, especially as we've come so far and they'll be looking to finish it in the first leg, so we've got to be on our guard.
"I just hope we can keep the tie alive. If we can, coming back to Bramall Lane will give us a brilliant chance."
