Playing the 7th hole--then a wicked dogleg right par five compared to today's more sedate dogleg--he hit a nasty pull hook that ended up behind a hot dog stand.  From there he got a drop for a TIO, and hit a wood into the left rough well short of the green.
His third shot ended up in the rough short of the pond fronting the green.
The fourth made the green, but left him a 6- to 8-foot putt for par.
The putt lipped out, and he looked up at me and the 5-10 other spectators standing behind the green, and said, "Man, that would've been a hell of a fahve."
