40 mins: Villa are building some momentum as half-time approaches, with Bacuna offering a more dangerous ball in that’s hacked away by Sakho.
“I very much doubt Benteke will get booed. As soon as he started playing regularly for us, it was obvious he was a much better player than the rest of the squad and it was only a matter of time before he left” says Tom Adams.
“He stuck around for longer than we expected, and dug us out of a lot of holes. He left with the minimum of fuss and thanked the fans as he went. He was the mirror image of Delph’s departure and I’d expect a round of applause from the Villa faithful when he comes on.”
