OAK BROOK, Ill., July 3â€” 
The 78th Western Open has its best field of big names in recent years, but for the second straight day the leaders came out of the Who's He? category.
Greg Powers, who was 122d on the PGA Tour money list last year, scored 67 today and took a two-stroke lead after 36 holes. His total of 136 was eight under par for two rounds over the 7,087-yard Butler National Godf Club course. Powers tied the record for the back nine with a 31, five under par.
''I've been in contention in 10 or 12 tour events,'' Powers said.  ''and I've never felt I didn't belong there. I'm anxious for the next two days to unfold. I've stuck to my game plan two days, and I'll keep it the last two days. That is, to play within myself and to keep the ball in play.'' Fortified Iron Shots
Part of Powers's game plan is to rely on his sturdy 1-iron, which he used on nine of the 14 driving holes today. He hits that club 240 to 250 yards, and one of today's tee shots was 260 yards long.
And then there was Don Pooley, who couldn't sleep ''real well'' last night. That's understandable because Pooley, 29 years old, has won once in six years on the tour. The cause of his insomnia was the lead he held after the first round yesterday. Today Pooley shot a 70 for 138.
Tom Kite, winner of the Inverrary tourney earlier this season, scored 68-140 and Joe Inman posted a 71, also for 140. Ed Fiori, a tour journeyman who has won once, carded five birdies and no bogeys for a 67-141. He was tied with Jim Colbert, who posted a 70. Tom Purtzer sank two consecutive 50-foot birdie putts on his way to 68-142.
''All these crowds must have come out to see Watson sink a few 40-footers,'' Purtzer said of his playing partner of the day. ''He didn't do it, so somebody else had to.''
And what about those big names who helped draw a record crowd of 32,700 today? Tom Watson scored 70 but because he shot 78 yesterday, he was far back at 148. Jack Nicklaus, after a first-round score of 75, shot a 72 for 147. Lee Trevino followed his 71 yesterday with a 73 for 144.
The 36-hole cut reducing the field from 156 to the low 70 and ties came out at 149, five over par. Among those eliminated from the final two rounds were Tom Weiskopf, 153; Scott Simpson, who won here last year, 151; Al Geiberger, 150; Jack Newton, 156, and Miller Barber, 152.
Pooley said he could not relax last night but added, ''it's not bad being a little nervous; I'd much rather be in the lead.'' To Pooley, the most pleasing circumstance was the prospect of appearing on television tomorrow.
Powers played the front nine in par 36, with two birdies and two bogeys. As he came off the ninth green he saw he was three shots behind Pooley.
''If it happened on a Sunday,'' Powers said, ''I might have got aggressive. But we still had a lot of golf left to play, and I stuck with my game plan.
''I wanted to be sure I didn't blow myself out with stupid mistakes.'' Powers reeled off birdies on the 10th, 11th and 12th. On the 10th he hit an 8-iron to six feet and on the par-3 11th he nearly shot a hole-in-one, the ball stopping one foot from the cup. On the par-5 12th Powers reached the front edge in two, chipped to three feet and sank the putt.
By now Powers was pumped up, so much so that on the par-3 13th he ''gave it a run'' at a 20-foot putt and ran it 8 feet past the cup.  The second putt lipped out.
After a par 4 on the 14th, Powers birdied the 15th from 15 feet and the 16th from 12 feet.  Pooley had a fine putting round with seven one-putt greens. He played the front nine in one under par, with a birdie-3 on the sixth hole, where he sank a 20-foot putt. Recovery of Kite
He had to scramble to save five pars between the eighth and 17th holes, but he finished with a flourish, sinking a 35-foot putt for a birdie on the 18th.
Kite carded four birdies on the front nine on putts of 12, 8, 15 and 12 feet. He started the back nine with what he called a ''disgusting'' double bogey at the 12th, where his exit shot from the right rough plopped into a water hazard. He recovered, though, with a birdie 3 at the 14th, where he hit a 5-iron to two feet, and another birdie on the 16th, where he ran home a 15-foot putt.
Inman, whose nickname is ''Jumpin' Joe'' because of the fidgety way he addresses every shot, had an erratic final 11 holes, with only one par. The other scores were six birdies, three bogeys and one double bogey.
Fiori hit all the greens in regulation and all but the 17th fairway. Even there he managed to save par by chipping from the back fringe to one foot. ---- Pat Bradley Shares Lead
POINTE-DES-CASCADES, Quebec, July 3 (UPI) - Pat Bradley, the defending champion, and Jan Stephenson shot seven birdies and one bogey apiece today to share a two-shot lead after 36 holes of the $200,000 Peter Jackson Classic.
Miss Bradley and Miss Stephenson, each one stroke off the pace after the first round, carded the lowest scores of the day at sixunder-par 66 to go nine under for the tournament at 135. Sandra Haynie, the first round co-leader, shot a 69 for 137 and second place.
