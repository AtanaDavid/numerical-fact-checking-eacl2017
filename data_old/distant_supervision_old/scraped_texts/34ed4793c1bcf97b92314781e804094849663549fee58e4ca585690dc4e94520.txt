Seven groups of seven players produce seven winners who play in one further group to determine the winner of the 2016 Championship League.
In each group every player will play each other once in a best of five frame match (21 matches) after which the top four players will contest in the play offs; semi finals and final over the best of five frames.
Players will be awarded one point for each match won, then most frames won and the least frames lost in the league series will determine their position in the league table. Dead frames will not be played in either the league or knock-out stages.
The play-off winner will progress to the Winnersâ€™ Group of Championship League Snooker while the players coming sixth and seventh in the group will be relegated and will not feature in any further group matches.
Therefore after the group has played its total 24 matches (21 League matches plus play offs semi finals and final) three players will leave and be replaced by a further three players for the next group.
