Everything sadly is relative. <br />
If your earning 50k a week. is that a lot of money? <br />
 (I'm not saying this is right! ) <br />
<br />
But let's be honest. if you earn enough money, that you can have anything you want. can we blame them for spending, even blowing some? <br />
<br />
Not a professional footballer fault what someone is prepared to pay them!</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Flackie"><img src="http://mobile.astonvillarumours.co.uk/uploads/thumb_image-443645115.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" align="left"> Flackie</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Yea mate sounds like BS, they don't give that sort of information out willy nilly, especially for a high profile customer spending those sorts of figures. When you sign up to those websites and agree to the terms and conditions within the privacy detail there are parts that protect you and your identity as a customer, and even if she were to be high enough to get that info (doubtful), telling someone whose then just letting people who he doesn't know that well know, it doesn't bode well for her job or their relationship lol. Unfortunately because of all that it has to be fake.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=chrisAVFC">chrisAVFC</a></span></footer><p class="ednote"><img src="http://celticrumours.co.uk/images/Ed0072852016.jpg"  alt="" style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">{Ed007's Note - I'd take it with a pinch of salt.}</p><div class="agreebtns">

No! And that's what I was trying to say. it's an obscene amount of money to you and I, but to a guy who earns a week more than the average joe does a year, it's pocket money. Like I said, everything is relative, <br />
<br />
I don't blame him having fun with his money if he can afford to, and I don't blame anyone earning it. If you don't like what they earn, blame the people willing to pay it!</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Flackie"><img src="http://mobile.astonvillarumours.co.uk/uploads/thumb_image-443645115.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" align="left"> Flackie</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Ed he said in his post he was always betting on poker, so he wouldn't have broken any rules, but still BS I think, wouldn't surprise me if he was spending that much on gambling and similar things. I just don't think it would be found outthe way it was described. Plus paddy power is a joke, their servers rarely let you on at peak times lol, if he had any sense he'd be on William hill vegas, then again it is Gabby so sense doesn't come into the question.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=chrisAVFC">chrisAVFC</a></span></footer><p class="ednote"><img src="http://celticrumours.co.uk/images/Ed0072852016.jpg"  alt="" style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">{Ed007's Note - Is it seperate accounts for poker and football bets, I thought it would just be one account to gamble on anything on their site? That was my point, I was just meaning in general with footballers, considering the money they make would anyone be surprised to see that kind of money going into gambling accounts whether it's for poker, horse racing or even their sneaky football bets?}</p><div class="agreebtns">

Today Steve Bruce has said that there's no better striker in the championship than Gabriel agbonlahor so people do we agree that his better than kodija dwight gayle even Cameron Jerome? Surely his just trying to give the lad confidence because gabbys record for goals isn't great am i wrong? Does anybody agree Gabriel agbonlahor is the best in the championship? love to hear your views as always UTV.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=mr.still.know.it.all"><img src="http://astonvillarumours.co.uk/uploads/thumb_tony-xia-1314517802.jpg" width="60" height="40" alt="" align="left"> mr.still.know.it.all</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

If he did say that, he has been on the jollop mate. <br />
I think even Gabby would think is this bloke for real making statements like that. <br />

It's called management. <br />
Getting the best out of people is a rare skill. <br />
Motivating under performers to give 100% is a Bruce strength and he has a lot of opportunities. <br />
We must all join Bruce in his efforts regardless of who is loved or loathed. <br />
If we all put one name on a list that we want to see re motivated, I would hazard a guess that 50% of the current players at VP would be on the list. <br />
The crowd must go with the managers decisions.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Oldvillan">Oldvillan</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

*Disclaimer - I don't know why I'm bothering but here goes'<br />
<br />
A fully fit and firing Agbonlahor probably would be the best striker in the championship but I think we all know we aren't likely to ever see that Agbonlahor again. Too much time has passed since the last time he really lit up games regularly. But that being said he doesn't actually have to be the best striker in the league to be an asset to the club so I commend Bruce for trying to raise his confidence. If he bags a goal or two off the bench who knows what might happen.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=AndyVilla"><img src="http://astonvillarumours.co.uk/uploads/thumb_aston-villa-logo-73796558.jpg" width="47" height="60" alt="" align="left"> AndyVilla</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Did Bruce say that about Gabby or was it a made up story by the news papers. God what is he on. Remember when he was at his best he had up front with him the likes of Benteke. Also in the team Young, Milner that's just naming a few.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=villaman">villaman</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Aston Villa is looking to sign £12 million-rated Polish striker Łukasz Teodorczyk from Dinamo Kiev in January. <br />
<br />
He is on loan at Anderlecht at the moment, and is scoring regularly for both club and country. <br />
<br />
I think that Bruce should loan him with the option of buying him after this season, and then we can move Ayew as a right winger. I think that we should sell Kozák, Steer and Cissokho and sign 1-2 players.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Hnchmchl85">Hnchmchl85</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Absolutely Buzzing! Deserved it as well, they had most possession but we had by miles the better chances! Formation worked well, kept it tight didn't give nothing away and attacked in numbers. Finally a good performance from Gardner, him and bacuna were outstanding for the whole game, kodja and gustede ran their socks off. <br />
<br />
Chester and Baker solid, Hutton put in effort and was good defensively (should have followed the pen in quicker though! ) only negative was cissoko, his effort and attitude can't be faulted but his a headless chicken, two pens in two games is ridiculous, Amavi has to start Saturday surely! Let's put a run together now, 6 points off the play offs! Up The Villa! <br />
<br />
Away support was best in the land, no booing, non stop and just as we started to sit back and invite pressure their it was everyone singing them home, brilliant!</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=chrisAVFC">chrisAVFC</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

chrisAVFC, I couldn't agree more, mate. I tried to see the match on the Internet. But the way I read about the it, I think that Aston Villa fully deserved their victory. Now we need to keep going like this, as many victories as possible, because we deserve better. It looks like we finaly have the right manager after the past 6 years. Hope this season we will win the FA Cup, but next season we will do our best to win just that and maybe the League Cup as well. I'm an optimist, that's why.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Hnchmchl85">Hnchmchl85</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

I couldn't care whether or not we deserved it; we bloody well needed it though. Too many times this season we have deserved to win games that we have ended up drawing. <br />

Think it's true, shame because playing through the middle he is outstanding! Owell he will learn, think the referee Saturday caused a lot of incidents, if a ref can't control a game then players get wound up and end up taking it out on each other.

Just read a quote from a Brentford forward saying "their lads were scared, if the lost the ball or put it out the fans would boo them, then they would crumble" and I do remember Charlie Adam saying "at villa park if you keep them quiet for 15 minutes the fans turn on them", I personally don't think this is true, heard the team being boo'd after the final whistle loads of times when they've played like a Sunday league team put together with 11 blokes who had never met each other and spoke different languages, but I don't think we get on their backs unless they repeatedly make mistakes. <br />
<br />
Professional players should be able to perform at a certain level and be able to cope with some booing, it should not make their ability drop to that of a 5 year old who can't be bothered.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=chrisAVFC">chrisAVFC</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Too be fair mate! if ANY other team in English football had our home and away record this last five years they would be the same. Football fans boo when players perform badly unless you are a Arsenal fan who boo when they are 2nd in the league lol<br />
Fans pay good money and i think we have won something like 11 home games (Maybe less) in around 100 games. <br />

I spotted a few things yesterday and so will Bruce have. Ayew is our best creative spark and we missed him yesterday. he worries other midfielders and defenders and creates space for us. We lacked pace in the middle of the park and as a result Wolves dominated with quick bursts of speed, they identified that as our weak spot before the game and took advantage perfectly. Jednaik looks like his legs have gone and Tishbola is slow when he gets the ball. Needs to be looked at as does our wobbly defence. Elphick out Baker in and bin Richards he's like a headless Chicken gone mad.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Devlins">Devlins</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Definitely would have been a different story. Ayew breaks things up and frightens the life out of defenders! Worrying thing is that he is the only player we have who can do it.

Hnch85 I was there v Wolves mate everyone was saying Ayew would have made a difference. Sometimes it's players with individual qualities like him who make things happen. Last night is clear evidence of that, he made the penalty then scored under pressure! Quality.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Devlins">Devlins</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

As I have posted before - I have been a villa fan for 57 years and I have not seen a player with such a s**t attitude. If he cared about the Villa he would have behaved got himself fit to go on loan an prove himself, he disrespected the club and the fans bu choosing not to do that. He has no football brain, is a crap finisher for a centre forward, and has lost the only asses he had which was his pace. Please Steve do not make a huge mistake and bring him back into the match day squad. you will alienate the fans and b toxic Flabby gabby will only play for himself and the money.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=mort13">mort13</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

I agree with everything you say. Hopefully we will not see him in a Villa shirt again. <br />
 BUT I would also say that we should trust SB. He is a great man manager. <br />
 So if Gabby did get properly fit and somehow become an asset to the team I would support him because Bruce knows what he is doing. <br />
 Might just put a sneaky little tenner on him scoring the winner against the Slumdogs of Small Heath in 2 week's time.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=AndyPF">AndyPF</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Not that I don't agree, he's burnt his bridges and Hepburn Murphy should be played over him! But if he plays and scores, they'll be 30,000 singing his name and tbh I'd be one of them.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=chrisAVFC">chrisAVFC</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

No, I'm saying this because I really believe that we won't change. We have seen that on and off the pitch time and time again, he isn't even trying anymore. <br />
 <br />
Last season he managed to score one lousy Premier League goal. With his kind of pace and stamina, I think that he should have been able to score more goals than that, at least give his best. <br />
<br />
I am sorry to tell you that if he plays again, you will be disappointed. Just my honest opinion.</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=Hnchmchl85">Hnchmchl85</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

Without the attitude some 4 seasons ago Gabby was not pulling up any trees, we stuck with him for seasons after that giving him the benefit of the doubt! Oh he will come back again after injury, after injury, after injury. He was all about pace and that has been gone a long time. If he were at full fitness he wouldn't make the grade. If full fitness and head together HE STILL WOULD NOT MAKE THE GRADE! His attitude last season and this season is an absolute disgrace and I wish he had one minute grain of decency and go out on loan to someone like Tamworth or Solihull Moors where he maybe King again! Good riddance and should never wear the shirt again not even a replica one when retired! As you can see I am not really fussed either way on the subject!</p><footer><span><a href="memberposts.php?n=NickB6"><img src="http://www.astonvillarumours.co.uk/uploads/thumb_image-987849274.jpeg" width="45" height="60" alt="" align="left"> NickB6</a></span></footer><div class="agreebtns">

I have a good feeling on this appointment.

Bruce has a habit of ruffling feathers and if he gets it right the doubters will hate us.
