The Centers for Disease Control estimated that roughly 91.9% of U.S. children ages 18 months to 35 months had at least one dose of the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in 2013, but that rate varies greatly from state to state and county to county.
The CDC state-level estimates are based on a survey of 30,000 children and have a margin of error ranging from 7% in Virginia to 2.3% in New York.
The following list shows the percentage of children vaccinated in each state and the District of Columbia in 2013. The margin of error is in parentheses.
Measles has infected 84 people in 14 states this year
