Tom Watson's wife hopes her husband's old Open triumphs will console him after lifting the lid on their Turnberry heartache.
But Hilary Watson admits her husband's failure to par the 72nd hole to secure his sixth Open title will live with them forever. Watson almost pulled off arguably the greatest win in the history of sport when he had an eight-foot putt to win the Open aged 59.
But the star missed and then emphatically lost a four-hole play-off to compatriot Stewart Cink to finish runner-up.
The Watsons left Turnberry on Monday to travel down to London for this week's British Seniors Open at Sunningdale. Mrs Watson said: "It's another week and another tournament but Turnberry will live with us for some time. I am very proud of him, to finish runner-up at 59 is quite spectacular.
"I know he is disappointed, but the best player won. The fact he has won it five times before helps a lot."
