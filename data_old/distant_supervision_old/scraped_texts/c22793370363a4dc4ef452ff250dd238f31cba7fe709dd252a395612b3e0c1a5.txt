Several months ago Paula MacArthur decided she wanted to get better at golf. She felt she was missing out on the advantages that men get from business golf and the relaxed way that business can be conducted on a course.
Paula runs a company that brings together men and women in a variety of networking ways and runs coaching groups for certain people within her network.
But Paula also had a second reason for wishing to play golf. Both her parents were mad keen golfers and played nearly every day. She felt that it would be a great way to spend some fun time with them. Oddly, or perhaps not, the thought of playing in front of her parents caused her far more stress than a few business golf outings.
So Paula signed up for the Break Par Blueprint having talked to me about it at a networking event. I didn’t think another thing about it until a couple of days ago when she sent me through an email with a card attached to it. She had shot 52 over nine holes with a birdie and a par in the mix. You can see the card below.
So shooting 52 over 9 (relatively short) holes might seem a long way from breaking par.
But this was her fourth round of golf. Ever! Her first nine holes produced a score of 75.
And she hadn’t spent hours at the range either.
She had simply focused on two core modules in the Break Par Blueprint – Basics and Modelling.
She has a half set of mismatched clubs. And doesn’t even have a wedge. But she has created a beautiful, effortless swing in almost exactly the same way that I learnt my swing.
