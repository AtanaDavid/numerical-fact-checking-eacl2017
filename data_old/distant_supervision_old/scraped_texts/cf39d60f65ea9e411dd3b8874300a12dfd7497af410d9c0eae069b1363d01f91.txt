North Star Golf Club in Fairbanks, Alaska is not only the Northernmost golf course in America, but also one of the most unique. This is not just because of the unusual and ever-changing lay of the land but also due to the likelihood that you will share the golf course with any of a host of wildlife species that call Alaska home.
Permafrost:North Star Golf Club property is underlain by permafrost, creating an ever changing pattern of dips, swales, and mounds reminiscent of the great courses of Scotland. No two shots are alike here, which generates great interest and variety as a golfer progresses through the links. Enjoy!
Local Rule:When a raven or fox steals a golf ball, a replacement may be dropped without penalty at the scene of the crime.
