Measles outbreaks occur in cycles in the U.S. and globally, usually every two to three years.1,2,3  Prior to 1912, measles was not a reportable disease in the U.S., so  accurate numbers of cases are not available prior to that time. In 1941,  there were 894,134 cases reported.4  In  1920, the United States had 469,924 recorded cases of measles and 7,575  deaths associated with measles. From 1958 to 1962, the U.S. averaged  503,282 cases and 432 death associated with measles each year.5
Before measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, the CDC admits there was massive underreporting of measles cases and that “because virtually all children acquired measles, the number of measles cases probably approached 3.5 million per year (.i.e., an entire birth cohort).”,6,7 Other doctors say it was more like 5 million cases of measles occurring every year. 22 In 1960, three years before the first measles vaccine was put on the market in the U.S., there were about 442,000 reported measles cases and 380 related deaths,8,9 among 3.5 to 5 million Americans.
There was a huge resurgence of measles in the U.S. between 1989 and  1991, when reported measles cases increased 6- to 9-fold over a previous  period studied between 1985 and 1988. During the1989-91 time period,  more than 53,000 cases occurred in 815 separate outbreaks.10 Also during that time period, 120 deaths were attributed to measles in the U.S.11
In an eight-year period between 1993 and 2001, there were 1804 cases of measles reported in 120 outbreaks. After only 15 measles cases were reported between 1999 and 2001 and with more than 90 percent of school children having received two doses of MMR vaccine, public health officials declared that measles was no longer endemic in the United States in 2000.12,13
In the years 2000-2007, the U.S. recorded an average of 63 cases of measles a year before an increase in measles cases was reported beginning in 2008.14
Increases in reported measles cases in the U.S. can be observed by looking at the CDC’s Notifiable Diseases and Mortality Tables:15
According to the CDC, most cases of measles in 2011 were among, or linked to, travelers returning from, or visiting, other countries, including those in Europe and Southeast Asia.16 In April 2014, the CDC stated there had been 58 confirmed cases of measles reported in the U.S. during the first few months of 2014 and many were associated with a genotype of measles prevalent in a large outbreak in the Phillippines.17 By the end of 2014, 644 measles cases spanning 27 states had been reported in the U.S.18
In mid-January 2015, the California state health department and CDC officials began reporting a “measles outbreak” they said could be traced back to a visitor who was at  Disneyland in Orange County, California between Dec. 17 to Dec. 20, 2014. In a Jan. 23, 2015 Health Advisory, the CDC stated “no source case of the outbreak has been identified.”19
Out of 52 confirmed measles cases reported in 7 states, including California, the CDC said that 51 were epidemiologically linked to visitors or contacts of visitors to the popular Disneyland entertainment park. Of the 52 measles cases identified by Jan. 21, 2015 in people aged from 10 months to 57 years, eight (15%) were hospitalized; 28 (55%) were unvaccinated; 6 (12%) were vaccinated and four had received two or more MMR shots; 5 (9%) were too young to receive MMR vaccine and 17 (33%) had an unknown vaccination status.20
On Jan. 30, 2015, the CDC updated their webpage on measles outbreaks in the U.S. and reported that 84 cases of measles had been reported in 14 states, with 64% (or 53) of the measles cases linked to the Disneyland outbreak.21
Public health officials estimate that every year in countries around the world there are about 20 million cases of measles.22
The CDC attributes the drop in reported measles cases and deaths in the U.S. to use of the measles vaccine beginning in the mid-1960’s23  But, published measles morbidity and mortality data give evidence that death rates for measles had dropped significantly in the U.S. before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963.24,25
“Modified” measles can also occur in persons with some degree of immunity, as well as in previously vaccinated persons, who get a milder form of measles. “Atypical” measles can occur in a person, who was previously vaccinated with a killed-virus vaccine used from 1963 to 1967, and who is exposed to wild-type measles. The course of atypical measles is generally longer than natural measles.26
