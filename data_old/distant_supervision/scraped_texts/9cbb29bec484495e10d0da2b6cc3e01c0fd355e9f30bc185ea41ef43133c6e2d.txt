Fantastic holidays start with great locations... and Slovenia has bucket loads of them. Affectionately known as 'Europe in miniature' you could spend weeks here exploring and always find a new surprise - from the sand and shingle beaches of the Adriatic coast in the south to the rugged peaks Julian Alps in the north. And then there’s the medieval capital and Slovenia’s lakes – regarded as some of the most beautiful in Europe. Also there are more than 8,000 subterranean caves and one of the world’s leading stud farms.
Slovenia is a relatively new country – part of former Yugoslavia – but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have its own cultural identity. They’ve borrowed a lot of the best bits from neighbouring Austria and Italy, evident in much of the cuisine and service you’ll find throughout the country, but there is a distinctively Slavic feel – in particular along the 26 miles of coastline.
And it’s the only country in the world with love in its name.
