That’s quite the article, written by a female reporter from the Baltimore Business Journal.  A few other excerpts:
“At the end of the season, the league's owners will evaluate which method of scoring draws more fans.”
“And that's the aim of the league — to attract more fans.” 
Yup, that’s certainly a good thing to aim for.  Great insight there Sarah!
“The Major Arena Soccer League is in talks with ESPN to air games on ESPN 3's "Game of the Week" series. Although the MISL's games were streamed on YouTube, the games are not televised.”
Um, ESPN 3 isn’t televised either  
(by the way Sarah, that should be 'were not televised', past tense.  You're welcome).
“Currently, the Major Arena Soccer League is split between four geographical divisions with teams from the U.S. and Mexico.”  
Those mexican teams of course would be Hidalgo and probably soon to follow in their footsteps Saltillo.  As Sarah Palin used to say, “how’d that work out for ya?”.  However, the new expansion side will be playing in an 8000 seat arena, so it’s all good.  Yes, it contains a small, oval shaped, horse show arena-ish playing area, but that's beside the point.
"They really think that they're better than us," Hale said of the former PASL teams. "We can't wait to play them and prove them wrong."
After those 24-0, 26-0, and 27-0 games, I guess he showed them!
In addition to the aforementioned bunch of endangered teams, I'd add Brownsville, Detroit, Sacramento, and Turlock to that list.   Gotta go with the under.
