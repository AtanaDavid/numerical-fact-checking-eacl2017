A place for visual representations of data: Graphs, charts, maps, etc.
DataIsBeautiful is for visualizations that effectively convey information. Aesthetics are an important part of information visualization, but pretty pictures are not the aim of this subreddit.
Check the best user-made visualizations of 2013 and 2014 (Jan-July | Aug-Dec).
A post must be a data visualization.
Directly link to the original source article of the visualization (not an image file) or tag the post as [OC] if you made the visualization.
[OC] posts must state the data source and tool(s) used in a comment. Only [OC] posts may link to image files.
Requests and questions must include a visualization. More info.
No infographics or other unautomated diagrams. Infographic vs. Visualization.
Post titles must describe the data plainly without using sensationalized headlines. Clickbait posts will be removed.
Posts regarding American Politics, and contentious topics in American media, are only permissible on Thursdays (EDT).
