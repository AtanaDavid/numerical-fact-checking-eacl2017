Recently, I become interested to grasp the data from webpages, such as Wikipedia, and to visualize it with R. As I did in my previous post, I use rvest package to get the data from webpage and ggplot package to visualize the data.
In this post, I will map the life expectancy in White and African-American in US.
Now I have to clean the data. Below I have explain the role of each code.
Since there are some differences in life expectancy between White and African-American, I will calculate the differences and will map it.
I will load the map data and will merge the datasets togather.
Now its time to make the plot. First I will plot the life expectancy in African-American in US. For few states we donâ€™t have the data, and therefore I will color it in grey color.
The code below is for White people in US.
Finally, I will map the differences between white and African American people in US.
On my previous post I got a comment to add the pop-up effect as I hover over the states. This is a simple task as Andrea exmplained in his comment. What you have to do is to install the plotly package, to create a object for ggplot, and then to use this function ggplotly(map_plot) to plot it.
Thats all! Leave a comment below if you have any question.
