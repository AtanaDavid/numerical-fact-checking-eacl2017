<p id="c6028151" thumbs="2">This wannabe actress has proven that she has no talent. Everybody knows it. But she was born filthy rich with a lot of connections. This means no matter how bad she is she will never fade away. She should be ashamed of herself to impose her as an actress when many other actresses with talent have to struggle for having descent roles. She has to do nothing for getting roles.</p>

<p id="c3146632" thumbs="0">Talentless! Gives good female rappers a bad rep.

This actress had millons and went almost broke because her decadent lifestyle, and now we have to give her $2 million to do some shows about her no-talent? There are so many poor people in this world who struggles with all kind of problems, and we give money away to " help " a talentless person? She should be ashamed of herself to accept that money because she don't deserve it. Only herself is to blame and paying the price for her decadent lifestyle with giving her money to help her is way much too easy. Give money to people who actually deserves to be helped and not to some has-been that nobody cares about.</p>
<p id="c1618060" thumbs="7">Lindsey Lohan is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. The only movie I actually like with her in it is mean girls. Lindsey should just give up her career and get some more rehab.</p>

She's not that good as an actress for serious dramatic roles. If she had from the beginning played comedies ( while she was still young ) she would certainly made it far as an actress. Talent for comedy ; yes. Talent for some other roles ; no.</p>
<p id="c6220590" thumbs="2">Not one of the worst or most talentless actresses ( some movies have outstanding performances of her ) but she's certainly not one of the best actresses of all time either. She's in the movie industry since she was a child and there must be a reason if she really never " made " it big as an actress. I have to agree that she's pretty and maybe that helps a lot.</p>
<p id="c6849807" thumbs="1">Greatest actress of all time? Certainly not. But talentless? Certainly not either. She's a very good actress in certain roles and a less good actress in other roles but she's got talent. Her personality and cuteness are a delight.</p>
