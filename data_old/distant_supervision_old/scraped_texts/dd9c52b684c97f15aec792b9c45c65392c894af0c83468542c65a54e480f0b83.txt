Betty Stöve (born 24 June 1945) is a former Dutch professional tennis player. She is best remembered for reaching the ladies' singles final at Wimbledon in 1977. She also won ten Grand Slam titles in women's doubles and mixed doubles.[1]
Stove began playing tennis internationally in the mid 1960s. She made her Grand Slam debut at the 1964 Wimbledon. A virus, complicated by a malfunctioning thyroid gland, forced Stöve out of tennis for an 18-month period in the late 1960s. Despite being advised that she should never play tennis again, Stöve recovered and had her best years on the circuit after that.[1]
Stöve's most notable singles match was the 1977 Wimbledon final, which she lost to Virginia Wade: 4–6, 6–3, 6–1. Queen Elizabeth II attended the final against Wade. This would be the last time she would attend Wimbledon until a second round match between Andy Murray and Jarkko Nieminen on 24 June 2010.
Stöve was also a semifinalist at the 1977 US Open, losing to Chris Evert. She also found success in the 1977 US Open by winning the women's doubles with Martina Navrátilová and the mixed doubles with Frew McMillan.
Stöve had her greatest success in doubles. She won ten Grand Slam doubles championships, six in women's doubles and four in mixed doubles. She won two women's doubles championships with Billie Jean King and two with Wendy Turnbull. Her other two titles were won with Françoise Dürr and Martina Navrátilová. All of her mixed doubles championships were with Frew McMillan. Stöve was the runner-up in seventeen Grand Slam doubles tournaments, eight in women's doubles and nine in mixed doubles.
During her career, Stöve won one singles title and 75 doubles titles. She reached a career high singles rank of World No. 5 in 1977. She was also ranked World No. 1 in doubles.
