Reports say at least 20 Palestinians were wounded.
Palestinian hospital staff said most of the injured had been hit by rubber-coated bullets, but there were some wounds from live rounds.
In the West Bank, thousands of Palestinians held rallies to mark al-Nakba, or "the catastrophe" - the term used by Palestinians to describe the creation of  the state of Israel 52 years ago.
One of the protest organisers, Khaled al-Khatib, said the rallies were an expression of popular frustration at the lack of progress in the peace talks.
The senior Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, and his Israeli counterpart, Oded Eran, held talks on Sunday over the release of 200 Palestinian prisoners.
