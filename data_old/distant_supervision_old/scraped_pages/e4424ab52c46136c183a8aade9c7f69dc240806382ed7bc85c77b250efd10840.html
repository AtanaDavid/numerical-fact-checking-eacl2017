<h4>1. General Types of Wager</h4>
<p>Point spreads and totals may be offered on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th quarters, the 1st or 2nd half, or the whole game. A money line is usually only offered on full game wagers. Full game bets on these types of general wagers include any overtime.<br />
&lsquo;Push&rsquo; result &ndash; Stakes on straight/single bets are returned, and in parlays/multiples the selection is treated as a non-runner, and the bet will be settled on the remaining selections.</p>
<h4>2. Money Line </h4>
<p>Both teams are priced to win the full game with no handicaps applied. When wagering on the money line your team must win the game on the field in order for you to win your bet. For settlement purposes overtime counts. If after Overtime the scores are still tied bets will be &ldquo;pushed&rdquo;.</p>
<h4>3. Point Spread</h4>
<p>A point spread is a bet on a team to win the game with the handicaps applied. To even the match for betting purposes, the favourite gives the underdog a handicap start. A favourite is indicated by a minus points handicap and the underdog by plus points handicap. At the end of the relevant period of play, the relevant handicap is added to, or subtracted from the selected teams score to determine the point spread result. Where teams are deemed to be evenly matched, no point spread is applied; this is called a &lsquo;pick&rsquo; game. When scores are level after accounting for any handicap the result is a &lsquo;push&rsquo;.</p>
<h4>4. Game Totals</h4>
<p>A total line is offered on the predicted total number of points scored. Prices are offered for the actual score to be over or under this quote. The total result is the combined total points for both teams at the end of the relevant period of play. When the combined scores of both team's equals the total line exactly then the result is a &lsquo;push&rsquo;. Overtime counts.</p>
<h4>5. Game Wagers</h4>
<p>At least 55 minutes of play must elapse for game bets to have action.</p>
<h4>6. Quarter/1st Half Wagers</h4>
<p>The relevant quarter or half must be completed for bets to have action. The 4th quarter does not include overtime.</p>
<h4>7. 2nd Half Wagers</h4>
<p>The 2nd half must be completed in full to have action. Overtime counts.</p>
<h4>8. In Game Wagers</h4>
<p>Normal US football game rules apply for spread/total/money line bets. If a game spread/total/money line is quoted, it is for the whole game including any overtime played. Please note: as with all in-play betting markets, the market may be closed at any time.</p>
<h4>9. Point Spread/Total Points In-Play</h4>
<p>This market is offered on selected games with point spread lines available and updated whilst the game is in-play. The Total Points quoted is for the whole game including overtime if played, and the result is the combined total points for both teams. Push rules apply. However, the spread in-play may contain a &ldquo;tie&rdquo; option. </p>
<h4>10. Game Props</h4>
<p>Normal US football game rules apply for spread/total/money line bets. If a game spread/total/money line is quoted, it is for the whole game including any overtime played. All bets are action for prop bets such as &lsquo;team to score next&rsquo; and &lsquo;next scoring play is&rsquo;. Please note: as with all in-play betting markets, the market may be closed at any time.</p>
<p>Propositions or &lsquo;props&rsquo; are additional betting opportunities offered on the game. They can cover a wide range of results and occurrences within the game, e.g., total offensive yards, total first downs, longest scoring play, time of first score, etc.</p>
<p>Any special game proposition bets are accepted single bets only, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>Overtime counts for all proposition bets unless specifically stated otherwise. For example, overtime does not count for double result, highest scoring quarter of the game and half with most points.</p>
The period of play necessary for bets to have action may vary from prop to prop. Customers are advised to liaise with customer services if necessary.
<ul>

    <li>Tricasts are only accepted for named or numbered selections. Tricasts are not accepted if they include unnamed favourites. Any tricast including an unnamed favourite accepted in error will be deemed void and stakes returned.</li>
    <li>In the event of two or more greyhounds dead-heating for first, second or third place, separate dividends will be declared and paid to each qualifying tricast. </li>
    <li>Tricasts are accepted as singles and doubles only.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6. Trap Challenge</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Trap challenge bets are accepted on selected greyhound meetings, and odds will be available on which trap will win the most races at either one greyhound meeting, or two meetings combined. </li>
    <li>In the event of a dead-heat, each dog is awarded one win. </li>
    <li>Trap challenge wagers are unaffected by reserves, vacant traps, void races or abandoned meetings (once the meeting has started). </li>
    <li>In the event of a meeting not starting, all bets are void.</li>
    <li>If two or more traps record the same number of wins, dead heat rules will apply. </li>
</ul>
<h4>7. Specials &ndash; To Go Furthest</h4>
<ul>
    <li>If the last remaining greyhounds are eliminated at the same stage then dead heat rules apply.</li>
    <li>In the event of two or more greyhounds qualifying for the final, the greyhound with the best finishing position will be deemed as the winner. If they dead heat then dead heat rules will apply.</li>
    <li>Singles Only.</li>
    <li>All-in run or not.</li>
</ul>
<h4>8. Australian Greyhounds.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Races are run with 8 greyhounds.</li>
    <li>Each-way terms are 1/5th odds 1,2 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should a race be reduced to less than 8 runners the standard each-way terms will apply. The dividends used for settlement are Australian NSW tote returns and may return a dividend for 3rd place on a race with less than 8 runners. Should a race be reduced to 5, 6 7 runners Betfred will pay the dividend on each-way wagers for the first 2 places only. Should the selections be reduced to 4 or less only the win dividend will apply, and any each-way bets will be all to win.</p></div>

    <h2><a href="#" class="toggleLink">Greyhounds Derivatives</a></h2>
    <div class='toggle'><h4>1. General</h4>
If placing a bet by trap number, then your bet will be settled on the trap regardless of whether or not a reserve is running. When a race is re-run all bets stand. However, where a price has been taken, settlement will be at the starting price returned on the re-run. Should a race be declared void and not re-run, all selections will be treated as non-runners.
<h4>2. Trap Challenge</h4>
This is a bet on which trap will win the most races at meeting or a specified number of races. If a race finishes as a dead heat each trap will receive a &ldquo;half win&rdquo; (3 way dead heat &ldquo;one third win&rdquo; etc). If two or more traps record the same number of wins dead heat rules apply. A Trap Challenge at a BAGS meeting will be settled on the results of the BAGS races only. Trap challenge bets are unaffected by reserves, vacant traps, void races or abandoned meetings (once the meeting has started).
<h4>3. Odds Or Evens</h4>
On a race by race basis it is settled on whether the trap number of the winner for that race is odd or even. Dead heat rules apply.
<h4>4. Inside v Outside (1,2,3 v 4,5,6)</h4>
On a race by race basis it is settled on whether the trap number of the winner for that race is an inside or outside trap. Dead heat rules apply.
<h4>5. Inside v Middle v Outside (1,2 v 3,4 v 5,6)</h4>
Settled on a race by race basis, this market is decided on whether the trap number of the winner for that race is an inside (1, 2), middle (3, 4) or outside (5, 6) trap. Dead heat rules apply.
<h4>6. Insurance</h4>
2nd place A price will be offered for the dog to win the race. If the dog finishes second, the stake will be returned. 2nd or 3rd place A price will be offered for the dog to win the race. If the dog finishes second or third, the stake will be returned.
<h4>7. Place Betting</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2nd place A price will be offered for the dog to finish in the first 2 places. Dead heat rules apply.</li>
    <li>2nd or 3rd place A price will be offered for the dog to finish in the first 3 places. Dead heat rules apply.</li>
</ul>
<h4>8. Versus The Field</h4>
A match bet between 1,2 or 3 dogs against the rest of the field. Dead heat rules apply.
<h4>9. Match Bets</h4>
A match bet is based on predicting which dog will achieve the best finishing position. Bets are settled on the official result. If both dogs finish in the same position, dead heat rules will apply. If one dog in a match fails to complete, the other will be considered to have won the match. If neither dog finishes, bets will be void.
<h4>10. Betting Without The Favourite</h4>
&lsquo;Betting without&rsquo; bets will be settled with the finishing position of the &ldquo;without&rdquo; runner ignored. Dead heat rules apply.<br />
<br /></div>

    <h2><a href="#" class="toggleLink">Handball</a></h2>
    <div class='toggle'><p>All bets will be settled on the result after regulation time unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>Should a match be postponed or abandoned it will be settled as a non-runner unless played within 48 hours of the original start time. Should a venue for a match change all bets will be deemed void and stakes refunded.</p></div>

    <h2><a href="#" class="toggleLink">Horse Racing</a></h2>

<h4>1. Ante-post </h4>
<ul>
    <li>An ante-post wager is defined as a wager taken at a price, anytime before 10 a.m. on the day that the final declaration to run is made. </li>
    <li>Ante-post wagers are accepted on the basis all-in run or not, entered or not. Except where specifically stated otherwise, stakes are lost on an ante-post bet if a selection does not take part and no Tattersalls' Rule 4(c) deductions are made from winning ante-post bets. </li>
    <li>When the same horse is taken to win two or more races in ante-post doubles, trebles and accumulators special reduced odds will be laid. </li>
    <li>On days when classic or other trials occur, ante-post betting may be suspended and new prices issued. </li>
    <li>Jockey Club Rule 121 decrees that stewards are empowered to reduce the numbers in a race if, at the overnight declaration stage, too many have been left in for the safety of horses and jockeys. Ante-post bets on horses compulsorily withdrawn in these circumstances will be void and stakes returned. </li>
    <li>Ante-post bets are settled at the Price and Place terms applicable at the time of acceptance. Should a wrong Price or Place terms be given in error we reserve the right to settle the bet at the correct Price/Place terms that were available at the time the bet was struck. </li>
    <li>Should a wager struck at a price on the day of an event couple selection(s) in that event with selection(s) in future event(s) then if the first selection(s) does not run the wager will be executed on the remaining selection(s) on the basis of all-in, run or not </li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Postponed Races </h4>
<p>If a race is postponed to another day and overnight declarations stand, then bets stand. However, single bets on horse racing will be made void and any selection involved in accumulative bets will be treated as a non-runner if: </p>
<blockquote>a. The race is abandoned. <br />
b. The race is officially declared void. <br />
c. The conditions of the race are altered after bets are made (as defined under Tattersalls&rsquo; rules). <br />
d. The venue is altered. <br />
e. The running surface is altered (e.g., Turf to Dirt/All Weather or vice versa).</blockquote>
<h4>3. Each-way Betting </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Bets are settled to win unless &lsquo;each-way&rsquo; is selected. An each-way bet is a bet of twice the selected unit stake. It contains one bet of unit stake on the selection to &lsquo;win&rsquo; and one bet of unit stake on the selection to &lsquo;place&rsquo; according to the terms advertised for the event. </li>
    <li>In general, for UK horse and greyhound racing only, the &lsquo;place&rsquo; part of each-way bets will be settled as per the following &lsquo;place&rsquo; terms:
    <ul>
        <li>Handicaps &ndash; 16 or more runners one quarter the odds &ndash; first four places </li>
        <li>Handicaps &ndash; 12-15 runners one quarter the odds &ndash; first three places </li>
        <li>All other non-handicap races of 8 or more runners one fifth the odds &ndash; first three places </li>
        <li>Races of 5, 6 or 7 runners &ndash; one quarter the odds &ndash; first two places </li>
        <li>Less than 5 runners &ndash; the place money is invested to win </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In all races the number of runners shall be the number of runners coming under starter's orders. Bets will not be accepted where the place stake exceeds the win stake. </li>
    <li>Each-way doubles, trebles and accumulators will be settled &lsquo;win to win&rsquo; and &lsquo;place to place&rsquo; in accordance with the above. </li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Dead Heats </h4>
<p>Where two selections dead heat half the stake money is lost and the full odds are paid to the other half. If more than two dead heat the stake is proportioned accordingly. If two runners dead heat for second (or third) place then those runners are deemed to have finished joint second and third (or joint third and fourth) etc&hellip;, with place bets being settled accordingly. </p>
<h4>5. Favourites </h4>
<h4>HOW MANY RACES WILL BE WON BY THE FAVOURITE?</h4>
<p>A fixed odds bet is available at selected meetings and is based on the number of races won by the SP favourite at a nominated meeting.</p>

</ul>
<h4>6. Forecast Betting </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Forecast wagers are accepted for all races of three or more actual runners and will be settled as a Straight Forecast (i.e. selections to finish first and second in correct order) in accordance with the Computer Straight Forecast return. If there are less than three actually running in a race, all Forecast wagers for that race will be void &ndash; win or lose. Should Reverse Forecasts (i.e. selection to finish in either order) be required this must be clearly stated. In the event of no Computer Straight Forecast return being declared, Forecast wagers will be settled in accordance with the NSL Straight Forecast chart provided that three or more actually run in that race. Should there be no official SP return for a race all Forecast wagers for that race will be void. </li>

    BC CB</p>
    </li>

    <li>In Forecasts, where one horse is a non-runner, the stake is invested as a win single on the remaining selection. </li>
    <li>In races where a horse finishes alone and no forecast dividend is returned, all Forecast bets nominating that horse to finish first will be settled as a win single at Starting Price on the winning horse. All other Forecast bets in the race are lost. </li>
    <li>In the event of two or more horses dead-heating for first or second place, separate dividends will be declared and paid to each qualifying forecast. </li>
</ul>
<h4>7. Forecast Doubles, Trebles, Patents and Yankees </h4>
<ul>

    <li>Tricasts are accepted for singles only. </li>
</ul>
<h4>9. Show/Board Prices </h4>
<p>Should a horse be withdrawn no Show/Board Price will be laid after the time of withdrawal unless the &lsquo;market&rsquo; is reformed. </p>
<h4>10. Early Morning Prices/Day of Event Prices </h4>
<p>These prices are on offer daily, subject to fluctuation. In the event of a withdrawal(s) Tattersalls Rule 4(c) will apply: non-runner no bet. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Early morning price&rsquo; prices are the prices on offer (subject to fluctuation) on our website, and they will be available up until 30 minutes prior to the advertised &lsquo;off&rsquo; time or until the first betting &lsquo;show&rsquo; is passed by S.I.S. whichever is earlier. </p>
<p>In reformed markets, the total deduction on the two or more horses &ndash; one in the original market and one in the reformed market -&nbsp; will be calculated on the prices applicable to that market at the time of withdrawal.</p>
<p>Bets on horses in the subsequent markets that then have one or more withdrawn horses will have a deduction calculated on the prices applicable to that market at the time of withdrawal.</p>
<p>Should there be a withdrawn horse the following applies for any wagers taken where an early price has been selected; the total deduction will apply to the original market price of the withdrawn selection at the time of bet acceptance, which may differ from the actual price of the selection at the time of withdrawal.</p>
<h4>11. Withdrawals other than Ante-Post </h4>

</table>
<p>In the event of two or more horses being withdrawn before coming under starter's orders, the total deductions shall not exceed &pound;0.90 in &pound;'s. Should a horse be withdrawn and a new market formed, then any bets laid at &lsquo;Show&rsquo; prices prior to the new show will be subject to the above deductions. In the event of a further withdrawal after the market has been re-formed, bets placed at &lsquo;Show&rsquo; prices in the original market will be subject to a further deduction based on the price of the withdrawn horse in the original market. Bets placed in the new market will be subject to a deduction based on the current price. </p>
<p>The above scale will also apply in the case of non-runners in Early Price races and will be used for other events where we specifically advertise that deductions in line with Tattersalls' Rule 4(c) will apply.</p>
<h4>12. Re-runs </h4>
<p>In the event of a false start, etc., resulting in a race being re-run, &lsquo;under starter's orders&rsquo; is negated and stakes will be refunded on horses taking no part in the re-run, with returns on the remaining runners subject to Tattersalls' Rule 4(c). The number of runners taking part in the re-run governs Place terms. </p>
<h4>13. Walkovers and Void Horse Races </h4>
<p>Walkovers and void races count as races but any horse so involved will be treated as a non-runner for settling purposes. </p>
<h4>14. Favourites Performance </h4>
<p>Predict the total number of points scored by the favourites at a specific meeting, based on the following scoring criteria: </p>
<blockquote>Winner = 25 <br />
2nd = 10 <br />
3rd = 5 <br />
A walkover will be allocated 20 points.</blockquote>
<p>Dead heats are equally split, e.g., two selections including the favourite dead heat for 2nd place = (10+5)/2 = 7.5 points, dead heat for 3rd place = (5+0)/2 = 2.5 points. For joint or co-favourites, the lowest racecard number will be used. If a meeting is abandoned before all races have been run, or if one or more races is declared void, all bets will be void, unless settlement of bets is already determined. Selections may not be combined with other selections where our related contingency rule applies.</p>
<p>Should the favourite be withdrawn before coming under starter's orders but too late for a new market to be formed, the favourite in that particular race will be allocated points based on its price at the time of withdrawal, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>Odds-on = 15 <br />
Evens to 5/1 inclusive = 10 <br />
Over 5/1 = 5</blockquote>
<p>In the event of no SPs being returned, the Racing Post forecast favourite will be deemed the selection. If there are two or more forecast favourites, the lowest racecard number will be used.</p>
<p>Our Double Result offer does not apply to this market.</p>
<h4>15. Jockey's Performance </h4>
<p>Predict the total number of points scored by the nominated jockey at a specific meeting on a specific day, based on the following scoring criteria: Winner = 25, 2nd = 10, 3rd = 5. A walkover will be allocated 20 points. Dead heats are equally split, e.g., two selections including the jockey's mount dead heat for 2nd place = (10+5)/2 = 7.5 points. If a meeting is abandoned before all races have been run, or if one or more races are declared void, all bets will be void, unless settlement of bets is already determined. Scoring is based on intended rides as per <i>Racing Post.</i>Non-runners&rsquo; points&rsquo; allocation is based on its Racing Post price forecast as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Odds-on = 15<br />
Evens to 5/1 inclusive = 10<br />
Over 5/1 = 5</blockquote>
<p>Our Double Result offer does not apply to this market.</p>
<h4>16. Winning Distances </h4>
<p>For winning distances under a length, distances are calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nose = 0..05 lengths</li>
    <li>Short Head = 0.1 lengths</li>
    <li>Head = 0.2 lengths</li>
    <li>Neck = 0.3 lengths</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum winning distances per race:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flat Race = 12 lengths</li>
    <li>NH Race = 30 lengths</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of a walkover after prices have been compiled a winning distance of 5 lengths will apply in a flat race and 12 lengths in a National Hunt race.</p>
<p>In the event of a horse finishing alone (all other horse fall/take wrong course) the maximum distance will apply. This is 12 lengths on the flat and 30 lengths for NH.</p>
<p>In the event of disqualification the official winning distance declared at the weigh-in will apply.</p>
<p>In the event of a meeting being abandoned part way through, or selected races being cancelled during the meeting, then all bets are void unless the bet can be definitely settled as a winner or loser.</p>
<h4>17. Match Bets and Threesomes </h4>
<p>All horses must come under starter's orders, or bets are void. The horse that attains the highest finishing position is the winner (<i>Racing Post </i>result). Dead heat rules apply. If both/all horses fail to finish all bets void and stakes returned. Bets are settled on a &lsquo;First Past the Post&rsquo; basis.</p>
<h4>18. Horse Racing (Non UK and Ireland) </h4>
<p>For some of the major overseas horse races, an industry SP and Forecast/Tricast may be declared. In these cases, if no price is taken and Tote (Pari Mutuel) is not requested, then bets will be settled based on the industry declared SP and Forecast/Tricast dividends. Normal place terms will apply for each-way betting. The above also applies to bets placed for racing in Dubai.</p>
<h4>South Africa </h4>
