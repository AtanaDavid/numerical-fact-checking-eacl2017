- ... it was our 250th
Premier League game live on UK TV - this time on BT Sport
- and the last time we were 3-0 down at half-time was also live
on BT Sport
- that was in the 0-4
debacle at Anfield in January 2014
- it was the second time we've lost 0-5 in the Prem
- the other one was at
Man City in December 2000
- in fact that Man City hammering was the very last time we lost
0-5 in the League
- the Chelsea game therefore put an end to a 601 game run in the
League without a 0-5 defeat for us
- our last 0-5 defeat in all competitions, by the way, came
at Benfica in the Europa League in Oct 2009
- and our last 5 goal margin of defeat was
1-6 at home to Arsenal in the Prem in August 2009
- overall it was the 12th time we've conceded 5 or more goals
in the Premier League
- and it was the 4th time we've lost by a
5 goal or more margin in the Prem
- it's not our biggest margin of defeat against Chelsea, though!
- that came in a 0-6 walloping at
the Bridge in September 1948
- of course Liverpool won 6-1 the following day against Watford
- only once before in the same weekend have we lost by 5 goals
whilst they won by 5 goals 
- that was on 28 September 1935 - they beat West Brom 5-0 at Anfield
- we lost 6-1
at Middlesbrough
- it was our first defeat at home live
on UK TV this season (in our 5th appearance)
- and it was our 4th
successive Bommy Night defeat !
- the loss at Chelsea also continued our appalling recent record
at their place
- since we won 1-0
at Chelsea in November 1994, we've now visited the Bridge
26 times in all competitons ...
- ... and we've won none of them! 
- that's an awful W0 D11 L15 record!
- in the League our record is W0 D10 L12 in 22 trips since that
November 1994 win!
- both runs are our current longest at any ground without a victory
- the nearest challengers for our worst ongoing away days are
Arsenal and Liverpool
- at Arsenal it's 22 games with no win in all competitions - W0
D4 L18
- the run is 20 in the League - W0 D4 L16 - since a
January 1996 win
- at Liverpool it's 17 matches without a victory for us - W0 D9
L8 - in all comps
- and it's 16 games without an Anfield League win - W0 D8 L8 -
since the Kevin
Campbell derby in Sep 99
- Phil Jagielka played his 274th League game for Everton in the
Chelsea game
- that's the same as Kevin Sheedy!
- they are both now level in 30th place on our All-Time
League Appearances list
- Aaron Lennon, meanwhile, made his 50th appearance for us in
all competitions
- and for Bryan Oviedo it was his 50th Premier League game for
the club
- Jags's start against the Pensioners was his 315th start
for us in all competitions
- he's now in 26th place on his own our All-Time
Starts chart, 1 ahead of David Unsowrth and Sandy Young
- Seamus Coleman's start was his 168th start for us in the Prem
- he's 1 ahead of Sylvain Distin and in 14th place alone on our
All-Time
Prem Starts list
- Kevin Mirallas came off the bench at Chelsea
- that was his 44th substitute appearance for us in all competitions
- that puts him 9th alone on our All-Time
Sub Appearances list, 1 ahead of Sandy Brown & Alan Harper!
- and so on to Swansea at home on November 19th!
- the late Gary Ablett was born on that date in 1965
- we won on our last November 19th outing - 2-1
at home to Wolves in 2011
- and we haven't lost at home in a November 19th game since a
1-0 loss to Sunderland in 1927!
- but we've never played the Swans before on that date
- our recent record against Swansea is poor - W0 D3 L2 in the
last 5 meetings, home and away
- and we only scored twice in those 5 games, 1 of them an own
- our last win against the Welsh side was
a 3-2 home victory in March 2014
- the last time we played them ended in a
2-1 home defeat for us last January
- but that was their only League win against us ever!
- our full League record against the Swans is W13 D8 L1 - F44
- in all competitions, home and away, our record is W15 D8 L2
- F50 A22
- if he plays against Swansea it will be Phil Jagielka's 275th
League game for the club
- that's the same as 1900s legendary forward Alex 'Sandy' Young
- they'd be level in 29th place on our All-Time
League Appearances list
- if Seamus Coleman plays it will be his 189th Premier League
appearance for us
- he'd move to joint 14th with Steven Pienaar on our All-Time
Prem Appearances list
- if Kevin Mirallas plays he'll move to joint 29th on that list
with Barry Horne on 122 games
- and Romelu Lukaku will be joint 35th with Johnny Heitinga on
115 Prem apps for us if he plays
- if Romelu Lukaku scores against Swansea it will be his 69th
goal for us in all competitions
- he'd move 1 ahead of Tim Cahill and into 31st position on his
own on our All-Time
Scoring chart!
- Rom would also move on to 51 League goals for the club if he
does score
- he'd be 1 ahead of 1920's forward Wilf Chadwick in 38th place
alone on our All-Time
League Scoring chart
- a goal for Kevin Mirallas, meanwhile, would be his 27th for
the club in the Premier League
- Kev would then be joint 9th - with Mikel Arteta and Louis Saha
- on our Prem
Scoring list
- if we avoid defeat against Swansea it will mean a 9 match unbeaten
home league run for us
- we haven't done that since May
2013 - part of a 17 match run that time round
- the hated Martin Atkinson will referee the Swansea match
- but we're actually unbeaten in his last 5 games in charge of
things at Goodison - W2 D3 L0
- and in his last 9 at our place our record is W4 D4 L1
- Atkinson has sent off 6 players in previous Everton fixtures
- 3 of ours and 3 opponents
- they include, of course, Jack Rodwell shamefully in the
October 2011 Goodison derby
- that red card was later rescinded by the FA - but the damage
had been well-and-truly done by that stage
- Atkinson also refereed our 3-1
defeat at Man City in last season's League Cup Semi Final 2nd
- he missed the ball going out of play before Citeh's crucial
second goal you may remember
- he and his fellow officials were the only people on the planet
who didn't see it
- if Atkinson sends off a Swansea player this time, it will be
the 50th opponent sent off at Goodison in the Prem
- if he sends off an Everton player, it will be the 50th Everton
dismissal at our place in our League history
- Atkinson may, of course, award a penalty in the Swansea game
- a successful spot-kick would be the 350th penalty goal (for
either side) in the League at Goodison Park
- a missed pen would be the 150th unsuccessful penalty at Everton
by all teams (including us!) in the League
- if Everton score a penalty it would be our 250th spot-kick success
at home in our League history
- and if Swansea miss a penalty it would be the 50th opposition
miss in all comps at our place
- all of those fascinating penalty facts do not, of course, include
penalty shoot-outs!
- new recruit Ashley Williiams
is our latest Number 5
- why not have a look at all of the previous Evertonians who have
played
for us as a Number 5
