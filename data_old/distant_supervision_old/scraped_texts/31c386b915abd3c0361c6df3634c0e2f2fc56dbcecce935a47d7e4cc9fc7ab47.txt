NOTICE  
All future fixtures from here onwards have
been removed from the site on the orders of Football DataCo
Ltd who told us that we would have to pay over Â£1,200
to continue showing fixtures on our site. Naturally, we will
not pay this figure which we consider to be extortionate,
simply for us to do a favour to the football clubs local to
our area. We don't expect to receive any fees from local clubs
from broadcasting to the world that they have games coming
up, but we are not going to advertise for them AND pay into
the bargain.
We will continue to show results of games that have taken
place but if you are visiting the area and wanted to know
if there was a football match coming up, you are not now going
to find out from this web site following the actions of Football
DataCo Ltd.
