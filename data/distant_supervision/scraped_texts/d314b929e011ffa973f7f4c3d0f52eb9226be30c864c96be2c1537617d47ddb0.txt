The following is a list of publicly traded companies having the greatest market capitalization. This list is based on the Financial Times Global 500 rankings. The list of non-public companies by estimated market value is attached for comparison.
Market capitalization is calculated from the share price (as recorded on selected day) multiplied by the number of shares issued. Figures are converted into USD millions (using rate from selected day) to allow for comparison. Only companies with free float at least 15% are included, value of unlisted stock classes is excluded. Investment companies are not included in the list.[1]
All market capitalization figures are in USD millions.
