The four markets are three-time host San Diego, Dallas, Ontario, and Chicago.  The sites were initially determined based on several factors including venue availability and suitability.  The potential hosts will be evaluated based on attendance, accessibility and the teams' competitive history. The final determination will take place in mid-January.
The top three teams in each division will qualify for the 2014 Newman Cup Playoffs.  In the host team's division, the three top teams other than the host will qualify, creating a total field of 10 playoff teams.
In each division the division winner (or next best team other than the host), will get a first round bye.  The #3 seed will play at #2 and the winner of that game will play at the #1 seed. The three divisional playoff winners will join the host team in the Final Four.  All rounds of the playoffs will be single elimination.
"Having an uneven number of divisions this year created some scheduling challenges when it came to the playoffs,"  said PASL Commissioner Kevin Milliken.  "With the format we settled on, however, we are going to be able to have our Final Four in a first class venue and give our host city enough time to plan and promote a truly memorable weekend for the semifinals and the Newman Cup Final."
