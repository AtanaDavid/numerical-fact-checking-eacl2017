ACTIONAID CAMBODIA: I would like to continue the good work of a close schoolmate called ADAM COLE who was tragically killed in a car accident on 19th April 2006. He had just sponsored a 9-year old girl called Ya Chea. She lives in the  Banteay Meanchey province of Cambodia. This province is one of the regions in which Actionaid has set up a variety of community projects to help the poorest and most disadvantaged people. If you would like to sponsor me and make a contribution to Actionaid Cambodia, please use this webpage. More details will follow highlighting how and where the donations will be spent.
THANK YOU: Both charities would be delighted to receive any donations you feel you would like to make so a big thank you in advance. Your donation will also be an incentive for me to keep grinding out the miles when the rain is horizontal, the chain has come off again, I have punctures in both tyres, there is no reception for World Cup updates and my saddle continues to slowly slice me in two!
We aim to sample only the local cuisine as we tick off the miles (Cornish pasties, Lancashire hotpot etc - please place all suggestions in comment boxes below) and reach each checkpoint in time for all World Cup games.
