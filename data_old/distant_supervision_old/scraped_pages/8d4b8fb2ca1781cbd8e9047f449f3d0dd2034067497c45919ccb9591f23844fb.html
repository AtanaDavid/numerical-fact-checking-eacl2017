Today we have a presentation <br />
of the mascot of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in 2013 in Moscow <br />
and summarize the preparation for the World Championships in the current year.<br />
Alexei Vorobyov, head of the Department of Physical Education and Sport of Moscow<br />
I'll present you some bureaucratic information. <br />
I want to remind you that in the period from 10 to 18 August 2013 <br />
in Moscow at the Olympic complex "Luzhniki" <br />
the World Championships in Athletics will be held.<br />
In Moscow, about 4100 participants from 212 countries of the world <br />
are expected to arrive. <br />
Work on the preparation for the World Championships <br />
is held in the interaction between specialists <br />
of the Ministry of Sports in the Russian Federation, <br />
the All-Russian Athletics Federation <br />
and the Department of Physical Culture and Sport in Moscow <br />
in accordance with the plan for the preparation and holding <br />
of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in 2013 <br />
approved on February 2, 2012 at the meeting of the Organizing Committee.  <br />
I recall that the opening ceremony of the championship <br />
will be held on August 10, 2013 at 21-00 (Moscow) <br />
at the Grand Sports Arena of the Olympic complex "Luzhniki". <br />
We have developed a transport concept of the World Championships, <br />
including the routes of buses and vehicles involved in this activity. <br />
The organizational problems of meeting the competitors, <br />
transportation of program volunteers, <br />
accommodation and meals <br />
are well-defined. <br />
We have identified all the areas of the Olympic complex "Luzhniki", <br />
which will be used during the World Championships. <br />
On April 24, 2012 we launched a planned complex of works <br />
on planar structures of the Olympic complex "Luzhniki" <br />
in accordance with the regulations, rules and recommendations of the IAAF. <br />
I can tell you that today almost 90% of all activities <br />
in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the IAAF <br />
are carried out. <br />
To do this, we replaced the existing sports coverage on the treadmill, <br />
the sectors for jumping and throwing at the Grand Sports Arena <br />
and Southern and Northern Sports Section. <br />
In 2013, we planned the renovation of the existing coverage in the Sports Village <br />
and the area for throwing in the "Hungarian Fields", <br />
as well as the replacement of the artificial turf at the Grand Sports Arena. <br />
After the end of the football season, <br />
we will deal with this issue. <br />
The following question is important for everyone, <br />
both for the organizers and for those who will attend the events -<br />
it is a matter of security during the event.<br />
It will be implemented at three levels: <br />
federal level, city level and the level of the stadium, <br />
the Olympic complex "Luzhniki".<br />
Mikhail Butov, Secretary General of the All-Russian Athletics Federation<br />
I want to say first of all <br />
that now our delegation presented its report <br />
to the IAAF Council meeting in Barcelona, <br />
and the championship is of great interest <br />
for all the parties involved in the process -<br />
athletes, coaches, officials, and journalists. <br />
For me it is even unexpected - <br />
there is a huge surge of energy and interest from our athletes. <br />
Athletes, our stars, all of the strongest Russian athletes<br />
say with great enthusiasm that next year they will play at home - <br />
here in Moscow. <br />
Many of them even put off the moment of decision - <br />
to stay in the sport or not to stay, <br />
that is, until the moment <br />
when they will perform at the World Championships in Moscow. <br />
This is great. <br />
This shows that our athletes are patriots, <br />
and they really want to please their fans, their audience. <br />
Not always even close relatives can go somewhere abroad <br />
to see how they perform at the biggest athletic events in the world. <br />
But here at home, they hope to show very good results: <br />
I think you read many interviews - <br />
there are talks of possible records, <br />
and they simply wish to perform with pleasure in the capital, <br />
here at the Luzhniki Stadium. <br />
Many foreign athletes also confirm the seriousness of their intentions, <br />
and I have not even seen any interviews or opinions <br />
about a possible withdrawal from the World Championships <br />
due to the fact that it was the post-Olympic year and so on - <br />
it happens sometimes. <br />
Everyone is ready, and top stars of world athletics, of course, will come to Moscow. <br />
We wish them good health, good training, <br />
and I am sure that they will please their fans. <br />
If we talk about our work on the preparation, <br />
the part of the work which I probably would like to mention is, of course, our mascot, <br />
which has finally been approved by the International Federation, <br />
this is a specific procedure. <br />
Now I'll only tell you that such approval has been obtained. <br />
We are pleased that the efforts that have been made in this direction by the committee, <br />
now, we think, have been quite successfully completed. <br />
We will surely present it to you. <br />
But the most important thing I want to say is that our mascot, <br />
the logo of the contest, <br />
any promotional activity that we plan, <br />
of course, are largely focused on the main thing: <br />
the success of the event and promotion of athletics in Russia. <br />
We are very keen that the World Championships become a real serious impetus <br />
to the increased interest in athletics and the sport in general <br />
in Moscow and in the whole country.<br />
Alexander Polinsky, Director General of the Directorate of Sports and Entertainment Events<br />
On October 17, the sale of a package of electronic tickets began. <br />
Retail sale of tickets on the site and at the box offices of "Luzhniki" <br />
is scheduled to begin on March 1, 2013. <br />
For official IAAF partners, travel agencies and TV rights holders <br />
booking tickets in general can be carried out until the end of December. <br />
Ticket sales will be organized by ticket operators - <br />
"Arena-Market" and "STS Eventim", <br />
which, in particular, are official ticket operators <br />
of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi in 2014. <br />
To ensure a high level of attendance and filling the stands by spectators <br />
in the morning and in the evening <br />
the program "Spectator" will be organized. <br />
For ticket sales for the World Championships in Athletics <br />
33,115 tickets for each day of the competition in various price categories are provided.<br />
In addition, the stadium assumes the presence <br />
of over 6000 accredited VIP-guests, team officials and the media.<br />
Mikhail Butov, Secretary General of the All-Russian Athletics Federation<br />
I'll say few words about the birth of this wonderful creature <br />
which we shall present to you now. <br />
Its birth took place in June 2012. <br />
I think that some of you have heard <br />
that a special contest on the Internet, a public competition open to all comers, <br />
was organized. <br />
Both for us and for the jury the idea was quite important - <br />
not so much its real embodiment as the idea itself, <br />
because it was important that the mascot <br />
which will accompany the competition and promotional campaign<br />
was recognizable, popular, and reflected the image of the event <br />
or some historical part to some degree, <br />
or was associated with the city of Moscow. <br />
It was important that it was associated with athletics, <br />
so it was not a very far-fetched thing. <br />
You know, in recent years the competition of mascots <br />
moved, of course, in different directions. <br />
For instance, there was a stylized dog in Korea. <br />
Bear was in Berlin, than there were girls, <br />
there were some phantasmagoric creatures. <br />
So, the competition featured more than 200 different works <br />
of completely different level, different directions, with different ideas. <br />
The result was the chosen one mascot, <br />
the mascot, which will be with us until August 2013 - <br />
maybe it will remain with us if we love it. <br />
And now I would like to present it. <br />
First of all, I'll present its author:<br />
Anastasia Urchukova is a Muscovite who created this project, this idea, <br />
and thanks to her for the first incarnation of our mascot. <br />
I will no longer torment you: <br />
we chose sparrow as a mascot of the World Championships in 2013. <br />
Here is a cheerful sparrow. <br />
You know, the sparrow is, above all, a bird. <br />
A bird has never been a mascot of the championships. <br />
A bird has many of the qualities of athlete, you know -<br />
it's a very quick and nimble creature. <br />
So, this is a sparrow, a bird which is typical for Moscow, <br />
probably, it is the most common in Moscow, <br />
and it is nimble and fast.<br />
Of course, we will teach this wonderful sparrow to throw, to push and to jump, <br />
so we will have a strong and fast sparrow. <br />
So, we have become more numerous - <br />
we gained at least one member of the organizing committee: <br />
we have a mascot, a sparrow, <br />
so I hope that together we will make it easier and more fun<br />
to achieve the desired result.<br />
