Information to aid interpretation of the data is available from the Australian Health Survey: Users' Guide, 2011–13 on the ABS website (ABS cat. no. 4363.0.55.001).
Data for the general and non-Indigenous populations replaces data supplied for the 2013 reporting cycle which was based on the NHS subset (20,500 people) of the full sample (32,000 people). The larger sample size (the full sample or core) supplied for the 2014 reporting cycle provides more accurate estimates and allows for analysis at a finer level of disaggregation. For more information on the structure of the AHS, see Structure of the Australian Health Survey.
For information on how the results compare between the two samples, see Comparison of Results in Australian Health Survey: Updated Results, 2011–12 (ABS cat. no. 4364.0.55.003).
Information on how to interpret and use the NATSIHS data appropriately is available from Explanatory Notes in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey: First results, 2012–13 (ABS cat. no. 4727.0.55.001) and also from the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey: Users' Guide, 2012–13 (ABS cat. no. 4727.0.55.002).
Many health-related issues are closely associated with age, so data for this indicator have been age-standardised to the 2001 total Australian population to account for differences in the age structures of the states and territories. Age standardised rates should be used to assess the relative difference between groups, not to infer the rates that actually exist in the population.
