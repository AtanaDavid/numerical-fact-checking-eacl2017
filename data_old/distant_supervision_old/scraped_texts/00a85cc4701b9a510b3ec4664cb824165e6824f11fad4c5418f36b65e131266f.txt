Thank you to everyone who has in some way helped MFRU on our mission. We would have gotten nowhere without the people who bought our music and came to our shows, the people who booked us for those shows and even anyone who gave us a place to crash for the night. We’d also like to say a massive thanks to Amanda and the team at Possessive Management for all the help and guidance they have offered to us over the last few years. We couldn’t and wouldn’t have done it without any of you.
A lot has changed over the years. Our brother and original shredder Andy left us a few years back to start a new life down South. That same year Boots arrived on the scene, bringing a new found enthusiasm that has driven the band for the last few years. But recently with the departure of our rhythm section Lee and Tom, we feel that continuing without them just wouldn’t be the same. It’s time to move on to new pastures, which you’ll hear about very soon…
From the bottom of our hearts, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. It’s been a rollercoaster ride that we’ve never really thought about getting off until now.
