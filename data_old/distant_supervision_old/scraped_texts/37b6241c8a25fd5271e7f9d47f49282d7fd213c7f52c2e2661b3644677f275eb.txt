Permanently signing Sol Bamba made perfect sense for Leeds United; he was a rock on loan from Palermo for the 2015 part of the 2014/15 Championship campaign. Talk amongst Leeds fans is that, such is his influence on the team, that he should be made captain – a role that Bamba has admitted he’d be honoured to take should such an offer materialise. However, after a 1-1 draw with non-league neighbours Harrogate Town, the physical Ivorian said that this coming Wednesday’s game against League Two York City is one where Leeds must get a positive result. Citing the ‘knock-on effect’ that such a win would have on the team ahead of bigger games against two German Bundesliga teams, in Hoffenheim and Eintracht Frankfurt, Sol Bamba told LUTV,
“The result is going to start to count because it is good to win games, that’s good for confidence.” Sol Bamba – LUTV interview
Head coach Uwe Rösler always maintained that the Harrogate Town game was going to be a training exercise under game conditions and that the result of the game didn’t matter. The game was simply being used to try out things as the Whites transitioned from the training field to the match pitch. Such a luxury will surely not be afforded against York City, a team who play at a level two tiers above that seen by Harrogate Town. Still, Bamba further told LUTV that he sees the friendly against York as key in the plans of Uwe Rösler saying,
“I think it’s another step forward for how the manager wants to play and that’s the most important thing.” Sol Bamba – LUTV interview
As Leeds look to step up the fluency of their game, York City might represent the last chance to take risks and ‘try things out’; a chance likely denied to Leeds’ first XI of choice when they face the aforementioned Bundesliga teams and then entertain Premier League side Everton at Elland Road on August 1.
