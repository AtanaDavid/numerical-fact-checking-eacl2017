With most pitches around the city calling games off early, miraculously Underhill Park was called playable.  Unfortunately, by the time kick off came, the only pitch playable was the small junior pitch, which makes for a very different type of game with it being very congested.
Mumbles started on the front foot, getting to loose balls quicker than Treboeth, and applied even more pressure by getting the ball into the box as much as possible.  Alex Smith headed just over from a Liam Brown long throw.
With Rangers feeling comfortable that they were in the driving seat, Treboeth fashioned their best chance of the game, with Mumbles old boy Luke Gear showing a good turn of pace down the right and firing a cross into the box, for the striker's header to cannon off the bar.
Mumbles played quickly seeing Luke Turner play the ball into the box in front of Tom Harris' run from deep, the Treboeth defender got across a little too late taking out Harris in the box, penalty awarded.  Tom Harris picked himself up and tucked away the penalty confidently. 1-0.
Rangers kept applying the pressure and dominated proceedings.  The ball came back out of the box to Liam Brown, who fired through the crowd but the ball skimmed off the post with the keeper not in sight.
Some more good play saw Luke Turner roll the ball across to Matt Lloyd unmarked at the back post, but having beaten the keeper his shot skimmed the woodwork also, this time off the bar.
Mumbles did manage to get their second of the game before half time to make the score a little more reflective of the performance.  Ed Bresnan won the ball strongly in his own box, he got the ball out of his feet and played a long ball (clearance) over the top of the Treboeth defence,  Luke Turner out paced the lethargic defence and lifted it over the keeper as he came out. 2-0.
Treboeth came out with more vigour early in the second half and Carl Morris had to be alert in the Rangers goal tipping wide from a long strike to keep his sheet clean, even if his shirt wasn't.
Mumbles knew they just need one more to settle the game and secure the points and it came when Treboeth failed to deal with another Liam Brown long throw, and Lee Watson smashed in as the ball dropped. 3-0.
As the sunset and floodlights were needed, Rangers topped off the performance with a last minute goal. Liam Brown played a quick free kick over the top and Tom Harris ran through and finished. 4-0.
