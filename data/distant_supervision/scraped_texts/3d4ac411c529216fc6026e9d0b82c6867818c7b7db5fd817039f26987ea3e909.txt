School data includes the measles vaccination rate for kindergartners, though states may have released rates for all students, all vaccines or in some cases, exemption rate by type (medical, philosophical, religious, etc.). Other states could not provide data at the building level, or did not keep the data at all, in spite of Centers for Disease Control recommendations. USA TODAY did not include data on schools with fewer than 10 students.
