All four Welland schools with senior boys basketball teams are scheduled to host quarter-final games when the 53rd edition of Ontario's oldest high school school tournament tips off early in the new year.
After the Tribune Tournament opens Wednesday, Jan. 9, with qualifying-round games at Centennial, Eastdale and Notre Dame, Jean Vanier will join the lineup of venues for Day 2 action in the four-day, 16-team tournament. As has been the case for the past several years, the Friday's semifinal games and Saturday night's consolation and championship finals once again will be decided at Dillon Hall.
Notre Dame comes into the tournament as the three-time defending champion, but the Fighting Irish will face a new opponent in the final should they make it that far next month. Denis Morris, tournament runner-up the past three years, won't be fielding a team, nor will Governor Simcoe, a six-time champion and consolation-round winners in 2005.
Every Welland high school with the exception of Confederation, which cancelled its senior boys basketball program late last month, will be playing for local bragging rights in the 53rd Tribune Tournament. As well, the three schools in The Tribune's Port Colborne and Pelham coverage areas - Lakeshore Catholic, Port High and E.L. Crossley - will all be back for another year.
Rounding out the 16-team lineup will be Fort Erie, A.N. Myer, St. Paul, Stamford, Westlane from Niagara Falls, Thorold High and three schools from St. Catharines - Eden, Holy Cross and Sir Winston Churchill.
Crossley is the defending consolation champion but after capturing the same title at the Standard tournament in St. Catharines the Cyclone have their sights set on advancing to Saturday night's final on the championship side of the bracket.
Same goes for Centennial, which beat the host Blue Bears at the buzzer in an invitational tournament at Port High earlier this month.
