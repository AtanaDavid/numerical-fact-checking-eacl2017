The 1892 British Open was a tournament that included some important firsts, one of which was the first Open trophy won by amateur Harold Hilton.
The 1892 British Open was the site of two significant firsts:
Previous Opens (and most other stroke-play tournaments of this era) were 36 holes, played in one day. The 1892 Open stretched out to 72 holes, played in four rounds over two days.
Muirfield, still part of the Open rota today, was brand new in 1892 - it opened only nine months previous to this championship. It was built by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, and Muirfield took the place of the Company's former home, the 9-hole Musselburgh Links, in the Open rota.

The winner was amateur Harold Hilton. This was the first of Hilton's two British Open victories (he also won the 1897 British Open). He remained an amateur throughout his golf career, also winning four British Amateur and one U.S. Amateur championships.
Hilton was the second amateur to win the Open. The first to do so - John Ball - was runner-up to Hilton by three strokes here (tied with Sandy Herd and Hugh Kirkaldy).
Another amateur, Horace Hutchinson, was the 36-hole leader at 152, seven strokes better than Hilton. But Hutchinson soared to scores of 86 and 80 in the final two rounds. Hilton, meanwhile, carded the best score of the tournament - a 72 - in the third round to move into second place, one behind Ball.
And Hilton put together another fine score in the final round, a 74, to finish three clear of Ball, Herd and Kirkaldy.
