The Pennsylvania Farm Show is the largest indoor agricultural event in America. The Farm Show Complex houses 24 acres under roof, spread throughout 11 buildings including three arenas.
The  PA Farm Show has something for everyone, farmers and non-farmers. It  provides an atmosphere for everyone to walk through, observe and educate  themselves about different areas of Agriculture - the Commonwealth's  largest industry, and what the industry provides to them.
The PA  Farm Show provides a showplace for farmers to see the most up-to-date  farm equipment, farming practices and farming needs while providing the  non-farmers with an educational showcase to learn about agriculture and  how the products they consume are harvested/processed.
