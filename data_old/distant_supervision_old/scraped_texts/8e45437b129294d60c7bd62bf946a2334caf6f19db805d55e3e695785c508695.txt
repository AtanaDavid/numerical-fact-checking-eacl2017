The 2012–13 Harrisburg Heat season was the first season of the new Harrisburg Heat indoor soccer club. The Heat, an Eastern Division team in the Professional Arena Soccer League, played their home games in the Farm Show Arena at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The team, owned by Harrisburg Heat Sports Group, LLC, was led by general manager David Grimaldi, head coach Richard Chinapoo, and assistant coach Gino DiFlorio.
The team struggled in the regular season, finishing 6–10, and failed to advance to the postseason. Four of Harrisburg's six wins came against the Ohio Vortex who they swept for the season. Their other wins came against the struggling Illinois Piasa and in an upset of the Eastern Division-leading Detroit Waza. The team fared better at the box office with the third-highest average attendance at home games, behind only the Dallas Sidekicks and San Diego Sockers.[2]
The Heat participated in the 2012–13 United States Open Cup for Arena Soccer. They received a bye in the Wild Card round then defeated Real Harrisburg in the Round of 16 before losing to the Detroit Waza on the road in the Quarter-Finals.
