(CNN) -- Argentina's Estanislao Goya claimed his maiden European Tour title but was almost denied by an amazing late birdie burst by Callum Macaulay of Scotland in the Madeira Open.
Goya survived a late scare to get his hands on the Madeira Open title.
Goya, in only his sixth tournament on the full circuit after learning the ropes on the Challenge Tour, carded a two-over 73 for a six-under total of 278.
But Macaulay, who turned professional after helping Scotland to the world amateur team title last October, came so close to an incredible victory.
He birdied the last six holes and eight of the last nine for an inward 28 on the Seve Ballesteros-designed course at Porto Santo -- just one outside the Tour record.
It gave him a course record-equaling 64 and posted the clubhouse target of 279.
The 25-year-old had nearly missed the cut but late birdies on Friday and a fine third round of 67 saw him charge into contention in dramatic fashion.
Goya, 20, had been 11 shots ahead of Macaulay as he started the back nine, but double-bogeyed the par-four 16th to find himself needing to par the final two holes to claim victory.
He kept his nerve to claim the euros 116,000 first prize and a two-year exemption on the Tour.
Irishman Damien McGrane and Dutchman Wil Besseling shared third place on four under, McGrane leaving himself with too much to do after double-bogeying the short 13th.
