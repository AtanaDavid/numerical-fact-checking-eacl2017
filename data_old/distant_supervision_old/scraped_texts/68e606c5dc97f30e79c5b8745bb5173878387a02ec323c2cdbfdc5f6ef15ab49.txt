First played in 1960 and won that year by Sam Snead, the Par 3 Contest has become a Wednesday tradition at the Masters. The Par 3 course was designed in 1958 by architect George Cobb and Clifford Roberts. Tournament participants, non-competing past champions and Honorary Invitees are invited to participate in the Contest. The nine-hole course is par 27, 1,060 yards and played over DeSoto Springs Pond and Ike's Pond. In 1987, the current hole Nos. 8 and 9 were added over Ike's Pond, eliminating hole Nos. 1 and 2 of the original course from Wednesday competition. In the history of the Contest, there have been 80 holes-in-one made, a record five in 2002. No Par 3 Contest winner has won the Masters the same year as his short-course victory. There have been 19 sudden death playoffs. Art Wall (1965) and Gay Brewer (1973) share the course record of 20.
Listed below is each year's winner and score, and the year(s) he won the Masters.
