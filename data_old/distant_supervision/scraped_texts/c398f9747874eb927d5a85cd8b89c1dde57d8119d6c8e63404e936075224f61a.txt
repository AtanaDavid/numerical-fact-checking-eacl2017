The National AZ Office Has Moved!
Please update your records with our new address for correspondence:
Returning members to the AZ Fraternity need to pay annual national dues for the school year in order to remain in good standing with the Fraternity. Your initiation fee of $95 covers your membership for the remainder of the school year, and then dues are only $30 per school year, payable in the fall. You can log on to the AZ website to see when your membership expires.
If you are unable to log on, it probably means that your dues need to be paid. You can pay online at any time.
Even if you are graduating you still need to renew your dues! You must be current with your dues to wear an honor cord or stole at graduation!
