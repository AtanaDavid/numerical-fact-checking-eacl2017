Thank you to you all for entering the fabulous HEXUS competitions.
HEXUS’ policy is to notify all winners via email within seven days of the competition closing.
Once notified via email, the winners’ first name, initial of the surname, and country of entry will be displayed in the recent competitions winners section.
If you believe your name is listed in the winners’ section but you haven’t received an email from HEXUS, we’re sad to say you haven’t won that competition – but please keep entering competitions because the next winner could be you!
