• Only six times has a player won the Masters and the U.S. Open in the same year. One good omen for Zach Johnson is that one of them -- Ben Hogan -- did it in 1953 by winning at Oakmont after winning at Augusta. The others were Craig Wood in 1941, Hogan in 1951, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Tiger Woods in 2002.
• Woody Austin began last week out of the PGA TOUR Playoffs for the FedExCup, ranking 145th in the standings. By week's end, Austin had climbed to 29th with his victory at the Stanford St. Jude Championship. The top 13 spots went unchanged after last week with Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Vijay Singh still running 1-2-3.
• The third-place finish for David Toms last week in Memphis marked his sixth consecutive top-10 finish in the tournament. The finish moved him from 11th on the Presidents Cup points list all the way to sixth. Mark Calcavecchia dropped out of the Top 10 and is now 11th in the standings.
• Phil Mickelson's four second-place finishes at the U.S. Open (1999-2002-2004-2006) ties the all-time record held by Bobby Jones, Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.
• This week's U.S. Open will feature players from 20 countries and 27 states. It will also include 68 former Nationwide Tour players. Of the 72 spots available through open qualifying, former or current Nationwide Tour players took home 40 those places.
In 41 professional starts, Tiger Woods has won 10 of his 12 major championship titles on par-72 courses during his career on the TOUR. Oakmont Country Club will play as a 7,230 yard par-70.
Geoff Ogilvy's 5-over-par winning total in 2006 was the highest at the U.S. Open since 1974 when Hale Irwin won at 7-over-par. It was the seventh time the winning total has been over par since the USGA went to 18 holes over four consecutive days in 1965. Ogilvy's 285 total was the highest since Andy North's 285 in 1978.
Last year Geoff Ogilvy did not make a double bogey all week at the U.S Open, the only player in the top four without one. Phil Mickelson (one double bogey) and Colin Montgomerie (two double bogeys) both had doubles on the 72nd hole. Jim Furyk had one double bogey in the third round.
There were no bogey-free rounds at the 2006 U.S. Open. The last player to go bogey-free in a single round was Arron Oberholser in the second round in 2005 at Pinehurst No. 2.
Through the 2007 Masters, Geoff Ogilvy has four top-10 finishes and 10 consecutive cuts made in 13 major starts.
Phil Mickelson, a two-time winner in 2007 including at THE PLAYERS Championship, has made 30 consecutive cuts at major championships, including 13 consecutive U.S. Opens. During that span, Mickelson has put together three victories and 16 top-10s.
No player has ever won the week before the U.S. Open and then won the U.S. Open. It is the only one of the major championships where this has never occurred.
