SAN DIEGO, CA.- The San Diego Sockers will be looking for their fourth straight championship this weekend at the Valley View Casino Center. The team was originally founded in 2009 and has competed in
the Professional Arena Soccer League (PASL). The Sockers have won the championship each year since their comeback and are currently in the semifinal round looking to bring home the forth title in as many years.
The current San Diego Sockers claim to have ties to the original San Diego Sockers and have the ï¿½78 on their team logo (1978 year that the original San Diego Sockers were founded) as well as 13 stars; the combined number of championships between the original Sockers and the current Sockers. The original San Diego Sockers had both an outdoor soccer team as well as an indoor soccer. While the outdoor team never won any championships, they did have some notable players within their ranks, players like Mexican superstar Hugo Sanchez and Leonardo Cuellar. The indoor soccer team won 10 titles.
Since being re founded the San Diego Sockers have enjoyed the success that was so characteristic of the original San Diego Sockers. And this has reflected in the support of the fans. Each year the average attendance for San Diego Sockers has steadily risen. In 2009 the average attendance at a Sockers match was of 1,705 people. Over the years it has had a steady growth, and now the current average attendance at a Sockers match is 3,744 people.
Since their re-birth the San Diego Sockers have also won three straight U.S. Open Cups. This year on their quest for a forth they were stopped short by Detroit Waza in the championship game. Detroit is also qualified for the PASL semifinals and will be in action on Sunday night at the Valley View Casino Center.
There could potentially be a rematch of the U.S. Open Cup final between San Diego Sockers and Detroit Waza in the championship game. The Sockers will surely be looking to avenge the 7-6 defeat that denied them their fourth straight U.S. Open Cup.
The Sockers will take on the Las Vegas Legends on Sunday night. Rio Grande Valley will play Detroit Waza in the other semifinal game also on Sunday night. These will be single elimination games and the winners will face off in the championship game on Monday night.
