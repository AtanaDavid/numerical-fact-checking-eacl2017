It appears your data is comparing 2004 gun death data to 2009 gun ownership data.
Here is where I got my data:
It disagrees with your wikipedia data in a very serious way.
Gun deaths by state:  the violence policy center data for 2009
gun ownership by state:  http://usliberals.about.com/od/Election2012Factors/a/Gun-Owners-As-Percentage-Of-Each-States-Population.htm
The resulting graph of deaths (Y axis)  vs gun ownership (X axis) shows a positive correlation.
y = 0.1533x + 6.1237  RÂ² = 0.1726
It is not clear to me how I post my graph, but it shows a least squares fit that runs from lower right to upper left, meaning:
More guns means more deaths.
It also shows, if you correlate the data by which 2012 Presidential candidate won that state, that, in general, the RED states have higher percentages of gun ownership and higher
gun deaths per 100,000 of population than do the BLUE states.
Tell me how to post my graph and you will see exactly what I mean.
