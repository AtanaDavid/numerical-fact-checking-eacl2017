Steve Davis,  OBE (born 22 August 1957 in  Plumstead, London) is an English professional  snooker player. He has won more professional titles in the sport than any other player, including six  World Championships during the 1980s, when he was the  world number one for seven years and became the  sport's first millionaire. He has  won 28 ranking events in total, second only to  Stephen Hendry.
Davis' achievements also include three  Masters and a record six  UK Championship titles. In 1988 he became the first player to complete snooker's  Triple Crown in a  single season. He is also a former four-time  World Doubles champion with  Tony Meo and won the  World Team Classic/World Cup four times with England. In 1982, he became the first player to compile an official televised  maximum break and is one of five players to have compiled over  300 competitive century breaks. Though he has not won a major tournament since 1997, he continues to play snooker at a high level and reached the quarter-finals at the  2010 World Championship. He was still ranked in the world's top 16 at the age of 50, and is ranked number 49 after the  Players Tour Championship 2012/2013 – Finals.
Davis has also competed in  pool and  poker events and has written books on a variety of subjects. He played at the  Mosconi Cup between  1994 and  2004 as a member of  Team Europe, winning the event in  1995 and  2002, and reached the final table of the 2003  Poker Million. He was made an MBE in 1998 and an OBE in 2001. He now combines his playing career with his role as an established television analyst and occasional commentator for the  BBC's snooker coverage.
In the book Masters of the Baize, a detailed comparison and ranking of snooker professionals, authors Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby rated Davis as the third greatest snooker player of all time behind  Joe Davis and  Stephen Hendry. As of 2011, Davis has won a record 80 professional titles from 115 finals,  28 of them in ranking events. His record of six world titles in the modern era has been bettered only by Hendry and no player has yet matched his tally of six UK titles. Davis has also  compiled over 300 competitive centuries during his career. In 2011 he was inducted to World Snooker's newly created  Hall of Fame along with seven former World Champions.
Davis was introduced to snooker by his father Bill, a keen player, who took him to play at his local  working men's club at the age of 12, and gave him  Joe Davis' instructional book How I Play Snooker. They studied the book and built Steve Davis's own technique on it in the 1970s. He started playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in  Romford, where at the age of 18 the manager of the club brought his talent to the attention of  Barry Hearn, chairman of the Lucania chain of  snooker halls. Hearn became Davis' friend and manager. Paid £25 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the country, taking part in challenge matches against established professionals such as  Ray Reardon,  John Spencer and  Alex Higgins. Around this time he was given the nickname "Nugget" because, according to Hearn, "you could put your case of money on him and you knew you were going to get paid."
Davis won the English Under-19 Billiards Championship in 1976. One of his last wins as an amateur was against another future professional  Tony Meo in the final of the  Pontin's Spring Open of 1978. A year later he successfully defended his title, this time defeating another of his future rivals,  Jimmy White, 7–4 in the final. Davis turned professional on 17 September 1978 and made his professional television debut on  Pot Black, where he played against  Fred Davis. He made his World Championship debut in  1979, losing 11–13 to  Dennis Taylor in the first round.
Davis came to public prominence after his performance at the  1980 World Championship, where he reached the quarter-finals, defeating defending champion  Terry Griffiths en route, before losing to Alex Higgins. Davis won his first major title in the same year – the  UK Championship – during which he beat Griffiths 9–0 in the semi-finals and Higgins 16–6 in the final. This began an 18-month period of dominance. He won the  Classic and then the  International Masters and  English Professional titles in 1981, and became the bookmakers' favourite to win the  1981 World Championship, despite being seeded only 15. Davis reached the final by defeating  Jimmy White in the first round, Higgins in the second round, Griffiths in the quarter-finals and defending champion  Cliff Thorburn in the semi-final. Davis's 18–12 victory over  Doug Mountjoy in the final confirmed bookmakers' early predictions, and in celebration his manager  Barry Hearn charged across the arena to lift him up in the air. He would go on to reach seven out of the next eight world finals.
He followed up his world title win with a 9–0 final victory over Dennis Taylor in the  International Open and then retained the  UK Championship with a 9–0 whitewash over White in the semi-finals and a 16–3 win over Griffiths in the final. This began a period of six months in which Davis and Griffiths contested almost all the major tournament finals. During this run, in January 1982, Davis made television snooker history when he compiled the first televised  maximum break at the  Classic at the Queen Elizabeth Hall,  Oldham, against  John Spencer, though he subsequently lost 8–9 in the final against Griffiths. In 1982 Davis won his first  Masters title, defeating Griffiths 9–6 in the final.
Davis's 18-month period of dominance ended at the  1982 World Championship, when he succumbed to the so-called " Crucible Curse", losing 1–10 against  Tony Knowles in the first round. Later that year, he couldn't win a third consecutive  UK title as he lost in the quarter-finals against Griffiths. Following those two setbacks, he won the  World Doubles Championship title with partner  Tony Meo. In  1983 Davis regained the world title with a session to spare in the final, defeating an overwhelmed Thorburn 18–6; Thorburn had seen his previous three matches go to a deciding frame and a late finish. Davis lost 15–16 to Higgins in the  1983 UK Championship final, despite having led 7–0 at one point of the match. In  1984, he became the first player to retain his world title at the  Crucible Theatre by beating Jimmy White 18–16 in the final. He also regained the UK title in  1984 defeating Higgins 16–8.
At the  1985 World Championship, Davis dropped only 23 frames en route to the  final, where his opponent was Dennis Taylor. He looked set for a third consecutive world title after an opening session of near-faultless snooker gave him a 7–0 lead, which he extended to 8–0 in the evening session, but Taylor recovered to trail only 7–9. From 11–11 the pair traded frames before Davis forged ahead to lead 17–15. Taylor won the next two frames to level the match at 17–17 and force a deciding frame. With the scores close, Taylor potted the final colours to leave the black as the winner-takes-all ball. After a series of safety shots and attempts at potting it, Davis over-cut the black, leaving Taylor with a reasonably straightforward pot to secure the championship. The "nailbiting" finale drew 18.5 million viewers, a record post-midnight audience on British television and a record audience for  BBC Two. The  black-ball finish was voted the  ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.
Davis and Taylor met again in the final of the  1985 Grand Prix, but this time Davis won in the deciding frame. At 10 hours 21 minutes, it remains the longest one-day final in snooker history. In the  1985 UK Championship final Davis trailed 8–13 against  Willie Thorne, who missed a blue off the spot which would have given him a 14–8 lead. Davis won the frame and then seven of the next eight to win 16–14. At the  1986 World Championship, Davis defeated White 13–5 in the quarter-finals and Thorburn 16–12 in the semi-finals, Davis's opponent in the final was  Joe Johnson, who had started the tournament as a 150–1 outsider. Davis lost the match 12–18. The result did not affect his position at the top of the world rankings, as he had won the UK Championship, the Grand Prix and the  British Open in the  1985/1986 season. At the end of 1986 he beat  Neal Foulds 16–7 to retain the  UK Championship.
Davis started 1987 by winning the  Classic, beating defending champion Jimmy White 13–12. At the  World Championship, he defeated Griffiths 13–5 in the quarter-final, and White 16–11 in the semi-final. In the final he again met Johnson, and established a 14–10 lead after three sessions. Johnson reduced Davis' lead to 14–13, but Davis won four of the next five frames to win the match 18–14 and regain the title. In beating Johnson he became the first player to win the  UK Championship, Masters and World Championship in the same year. In December he retained his  UK title with a 16–14 final win against White. In 1988 retained the  Classic, claimed his second  Masters title with a 9–0 final whitewash of  Mike Hallett (the only final whitewash in the event's history), won the  World Cup with England and won his fourth  Irish Masters title. In the  World Championship Davis defeated Hallett 13–1,  Tony Drago 13–4 and Thorburn 16–8 en route to the final, where he met Griffiths. Davis established a 5–2 lead after the first session, but Griffiths levelled at 8–8 after the second. On the second day of the match Davis took ten out of thirteen frames to win 18–11 and claim his fifth world title.
Davis won the first ranking event of the  1988/1989 season with a 12–6 win over White in the  International Open; in the same match, he became the first player to make three consecutive century breaks in a major tournament. In October, Davis won the  Grand Prix, beating Alex Higgins 10–6 in the final to hold the World, UK, Masters, Grand Prix, Classic and Irish Masters titles simultaneously. However, his four year unbeaten run at the  UK Championship came to an end in December with a 3–9 semi-final loss to Hendry. He did not win another major title that season until the  1989 World Championship, where he beat Hendry 16–9 in the semi-finals before going on to complete the heaviest victory in a world final of the modern era with an 18–3 win over  John Parrott, his last world championship to date. In October he retained the  Grand Prix, beating  Dean Reynolds 10–0 in the final, the first  whitewash in a ranking event final. By the end of the 1980s, Davis was snooker's first millionaire.
In the  1990 World Championship, Davis was denied an eighth consecutive appearance in the final by Jimmy White, who won their semi-final 16–14. Davis was replaced as world number one by  Stephen Hendry at the end of the  1989/90 season. He was ranked number 2 for the  1990/1991,  1991/1992,  1994/1995 and  1995/1996 seasons. He reached the semi-finals of the World Championships in  1991 and  1994. He also won the  Irish Masters in 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1994, the  Classic and the  Asian Open in 1992, the  European Open in 1993, and consecutive  Welsh Open titles in  1994 and  1995. His successful defence of his Welsh Open title in 1995 is to date his last  ranking title. Davis's last victory in a major tournament came at the  1997 Masters. Trailing his opponent  Ronnie O'Sullivan 4–8 in the final, he won the next six frames to secure a 10–8 win.
After a season which saw Davis reach only one ranking event quarter-final, Davis dropped out of the top 16 for the  2000/2001 season, and failed to qualify for the World Championship for the next two years. After failing to qualify for the World Snooker Championship for the first time in his professional career in  2001, Davis felt that retiring would be the easy thing to do, but as he still liked the challenge of snooker, he continued playing, and regained his place in the top 16 for the  2003/2004 season. He was runner-up in the  2004 Welsh Open to O'Sullivan, losing 8–9 after having led 8–5. In  2005 he reached the quarter finals of the World Championship, losing to eventual winner  Shaun Murphy.
At the  2005 UK Championship, held in York, Davis reached his 100th major career final, and made his first appearance in the UK final since 1990. En route he beat defending champion  Stephen Maguire 9–8, a win which included a 145 break; and then  Stephen Hendry 9–6 in the semi-finals to reach the final, where he lost 6–10 against  Ding Junhui. Before the  World Championships Davis brushed off suggestions of retirement, and he reached the second round, where he lost to Murphy. Davis's performances through the  2006/2007 season, including reaching the  UK Championship quarter-finals and the  Welsh Open semi-finals, ensured he was still a top 16 player at the age of 50.
He dropped out of the top sixteen a year later, but showed form in the  2008/2009 season by reaching the quarter-finals of both the  Shanghai Masters and  Grand Prix, the first time he had reached consecutive ranking event quarter-finals since 1996. At the  World Championship Davis lost in the first round 2–10 against Neil Robertson. After the match he again dismissed talk of his retirement.
In the first two tournaments of the  2009/2010 season Davis failed to qualify for the televised stages as he lost 4–5 against  Matthew Selt in the  Shanghai Masters and 0–5 against  Mark Davis in the  Grand Prix. In the next tournament, the  UK Championship, he defeated  Michael Judge 9–7 to set up a first round match against Hendry, which he lost 6–9. Davis started 2010 by failing to qualify for the  Welsh Open and the  China Open, losing 2–5 against  Dominic Dale and 3–5 against  Mike Dunn respectively in the final qualifying round. In March he qualified for the  World Championship for a record 30th time by defeating  Adrian Gunnell 10–4.
In the first round Davis defeated  Mark King 10–9, becoming, at the age of 52, the oldest player to win a match at the Crucible since  Eddie Charlton beat  Cliff Thorburn in 1989. In the second round against defending champion  John Higgins, a 1–20 favourite, Davis led 6–2 after the first session, 9–7 after the second session, and ultimately won 13–11, a win  Clive Everton described as "the greatest upset in the 33 years the Crucible has been hosting the championship." This made him the oldest world quarter-finalist since Charlton in 1983. In the quarter-final match against Australian  Neil Robertson, Davis recovered from a 2–12 deficit to force the match into the third session, eventually losing 5–13. On 29 April 2010, to mark the 25th anniversary of their black-ball final of 1985, Davis appeared with Dennis Taylor before the beginning of the first semi-final, to stage a humorous re-enactment of their historic final frame. Taylor entered the arena wearing a pair of comically oversized glasses, while Davis arrived sporting a red wig.
Davis started the  2010/2011 season by qualifying to the televised stages of  Shanghai Masters, whitewashing Rod Lawler 5–0, but lost in the first round 3–5 against  Jamie Cope. He lost his qualifying matches in the next two tournaments, he lost 1–3 against  Peter Ebdon in the last 64 of the  World Open and 2–9 against  Mark Joyce in the last 48 of the  UK Championship. He also participated at the  Players Tour Championship, where his best results came at the  Paul Hunter Classic, where he reached the quarter-finals, but lost 1–4 against  Shaun Murphy. He finished 67 on the  Order of Merit. Davis also reached the final of the  World Seniors Championship, but lost in the final 1–4 against  Jimmy White. He reached the third qualifying round of the  German Masters, but was whitewashed by Ryan Day 0–5. Davis lost his first qualifying matches of the next two tournaments. He was beaten by  Joe Jogia 3–4 in the  Welsh Open and 4–5 by  James Wattana in the  China Open. He narrowly reached the last qualifying round of the  World Championship, by defeating  Jack Lisowski 10–9, but lost against  Stephen Lee 2–10.
Davis started the  2011/2012 season at number 44, his lowest rank since turning professional. He lost his first qualifying match at the  Shanghai Masters 1–5 against  Passakorn Suwannawat. Davis also participated at the  Players Tour Championship, where his best results came at the  Warsaw Classic, where he reached the semi-finals, but lost 3–4 against  Ricky Walden. He finished number 26 on the  Order of Merit. After 2010 he reached the final of the  World Seniors Championship, but again lost in the final, this time 1–2 against  Darren Morgan. He qualified for the  UK Championship, by defeating both  Ian McCulloch and  Andrew Higginson 6–2, but he couldn't qualify to the  German Masters as he lost 1–5 against  Robert Milkins and also lost in the first round of the UK Championship 1–6 against  Ronnie O'Sullivan. Davis than missed the  World Open, as he lost his first qualifying match 1–5 against  Ian McCulloch, but reached the last 16 of the  Welsh Open with three 4–3 victories, defeating  Lucky Vatnani,  Ricky Walden and  Allister Carter, before losing 0–4 against  Shaun Murphy. However he then didn't qualify for either the  China Open, nor the  World Snooker Championship, losing 1–5 to  Rory McLeod and 7–10 to  Ben Woollaston respectively.
Davis started the  2012/2013 season at number 51, but couldn't qualify for the first two ranking events, as he lost 3–5 against  Kurt Maflin at the  Wuxi Classic, and 0–5 against  Michael Wild at the  Australian Goldfields Open. Davis took part in the  Six-red World Championship, where he finished third in Group E with three wins out of five matches and advanced to the knock-out stage, but lost 1–6 against  Mark Davis in the last 32. Davis qualified for the  Shanghai Masters by defeating  Alfie Burden 5–1 and  Andrew Higginson 5–0. There he defeated  Zhu Yinghui 5–1 to reach the last 32, but lost 4–5 against  Ricky Walden. He however couldn't qualify for the  International Championship after losing his first qualifying match 5–6 against  Pankaj Advani. Davis then qualified for the final stages of the  UK Championship by defeating Advani 6–5 and  Jamie Burnett 6–2, but lost 2–6 against  Ali Carter. He also lost hist first qualifying match at  German Masters 4–5 against  Simon Bedford.
From 1994 to 2007, Davis played in professional  nine-ball  pool events regularly. He was instrumental in the creation of the  Mosconi Cup, and has represented Europe in the tournament on eleven occasions, and was a member of the team's  1995 and  2002 wins; his victory against the US's  Earl Strickland clinched the 2002 competition for Europe. In 2001, Davis nearly won his first singles title in pool at the  World Pool League. However,  Efren Reyes defeated him 9–5 the final.  Sid Waddell gave him the nickname "Romford Slim" and said he was Britain's answer to the famous American pool player  Rudolf "Minnesota Fats" Wanderone. Davis dislikes  eight-ball pool as played on English-style tables in British  pubs and clubs, considering it a "Mickey Mouse game" because of its under-sized cue ball in relation to the other balls, but made it clear that he is only critical of the game when it is played with an undersized cue ball. He is also a keen chess player and was for a while the President of the  British Chess Federation.
Davis has also become a proficient  poker player, with successful appearances at televised tournaments; one of these included an appearance at the final table of the 2003  Poker Million together with fellow snooker player  Jimmy White, who eventually won. Later, at  Event 41 of the  2006 World Series of Poker, Davis finished 579th, winning US$20,617. At  Event 54 of the  2008 World Series of Poker he finished 389th, winning $28,950. At  Event 56 of the  2010 World Series of Poker he finished 131st, winning $5,491. At Event 22 of the 2011 The Grand Poker Series he finished 8th, winning $2,049.
In 1988, Davis was named the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year and was made an  MBE. He was awarded an  OBE in 2001, and is currently honorary president of the  Snooker Writers' Association. Davis is a big fan of the French  progressive rock band  Magma, and even organised a concert in London so he could watch them. Davis is on the board of  Leyton Orient football club, which he has revealed to be more of a gimmick; Davis has been a  Charlton Athletic fan most of his life, and  Barry Hearn is the Orient chairman. He lives in  Brentwood, Essex, and divorced from his wife Judith in 2005 after 15 years of marriage. Together, they have two sons called Greg (born 1991) and Jack (born 1993). In 2012 Greg Davis entered the Q School, with the aim of winning a place on the  professional snooker tour.
