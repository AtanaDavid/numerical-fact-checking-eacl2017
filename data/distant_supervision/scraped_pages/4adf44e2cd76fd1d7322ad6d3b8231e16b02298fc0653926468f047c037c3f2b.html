        <h1 id="h1">Banking</h1>
        <p><u> Private Versus Government Banks</u></p>
        <p> Mexico had a two tiered banking system consisting of governmental banking institutions and private banks that lasted until 1982, when the banking system was nationalized and consolidated. By 1985, only 18 commercial banks remained all state run. The tide of nationalization turned in 1987, though, when the government took the first tentative steps toward re-privatization. This process gained momentum in 1991, so that by the summer of 1992 all 18 commercial banks were privately owned. By 1993, the government was encouraging the formation of new private banks, and even allowed American and Canadian banks to begin 
          operating in Mexico in anticipation of NAFTA. A financial crisis in 1995 resulted in a staggering loss to banks of 4.5 billion pesos in the first fiscal quarter of that year. Rising interest rates naturally followed. Banks eventually found themselves burdened with a large number of non-performing loans that necessitated a government “bail-out” for bank debtors involving the radical re-structuring of loans to prevent a complete economic collapse. In the end, by 1996 the government effectively owned 25% of bank assets. </p>
        <p><u> Banking Reforms</u></p>
        <p> Since the financial collapse of the mid-1990s, Mexico has instituted numerous reforms, much like the U.S. did following the stock market collapse of 1929. One of these reforms was the Law to Protect Bank Savings (LPAB) that went into effect at the beginning of 1999, designed to promote financial stability by inspiring greater consumer confidence in the private banking system. The LPAB, among other things, established the Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings (Instituto para la Protección del Ahorro Bancario), administered by a seven member governing board that includes the Secretary of Finance and Public Credit, the Governor of Banco de Mexico, and the Chairman of the National Banking and Securities Commission, and four voting members appointed by the President of Mexico and approved by the Senate. The two largest private banks are Banco de Bilbao y Vizcaya, owned by the Spanish, and Banco Nacional de Mexico, which was purchased by City Bank, but still operates under its own name. </p>
        <p><u> Specialized State Owned Banks</u></p>
        <p> The central bank is Banco de Mexico, which was made autonomous in 1994. It alone issues and regulates currency, manages credit, fixes the nation’s financial reserve, funds government development programs, sells gold, and generally supervises banking through the National Banking Commission. Mexico also has numerous state owned banks for specialized areas, such as agriculture, public works, transportation, and various industries like oil and sugar. Nafinsa Bank, which handles funds for Mexico’s industrialization programs, supports Mexican investment companies, oversees the stock market and issues public securities, and is the legal depository of government securities. </p>
        <p><u> Banking Scandals</u></p>
        <p> The banking system in Mexico has always been plagued by charges of corruption, which charges have only grown more acute with the rise of the international drug trade, One such charge resulted in a minor international incident in 1996 when, during a hemisphere wide drug trafficking conference, American DEA chief Thomas Constantine asserted that Mexican banks were working with drug traffickers to launder millions of dollars in drug money. The Mexican press expressed loud outrage, while the Mexican Foreign Ministry categorically denied the charge. This was ironic considering that the government of Ernesto Zedillo had itself introduced an anti-narcotics bill into Congress that aimed to suppress such money laundering. </p>
        <p> The largest banking corruption scandal in Mexico’s history would erupt only two years later, in 1998. The scandal involved FOBAPROA (Fondo Bancario de Proteccion al Ahorro), the trust fund for the protection of bank deposits established in the wake of the 1994 peso collapse, which was found to have been involved in illegal loans to bank shareholder companies and already bankrupt businesses. A Canadian auditor in 1999 discovered around $7 billion in questionable transactions, and subsequent audits unearthed $4 billion in irregular loans. The banks halted further audits by using a legal procedure known as “amparo” (“shelter” or “refuge”) that, ironically, was originally intended to protect Mexican citizens from illegal prosecution by corrupt law enforcement agencies. To date, legal proceedings have focused on the right of the banks to avoid audits. No individual has yet even been investigated for involvement in a FOBAPROA crime, much less prosecuted. </p>

      <!-- Utilities -->
      <div> <a name="Utilities"></a>
        <h1 id="h2">Utilities</h1>
        <p><u> Electricity</u></p>
        <p> Thermal electrical generation — which burns domestically produced oil and natural gas — has replaced hydroelectric generation in Mexico. The country is hampered by an inefficient state owned energy sector that suffers from corruption and strangling regulations. The administration of Vincente Fox attempted a reform of the energy sector, which would have required constitutional changes, but was prevented by political opposition. Nevertheless, electricity production in 2003 exceeded domestic consumption. Out of 209.2 kilowatt hours produced, Mexico consumed 193.9 kwh, allowing for the export of 1.07 kwh. The Federal Commission of Electricity operates the electrical power grid. </p>
        <p> Mexican homes receive electrical bills every two months, which may be paid at most banks, supermarkets, and even some convenience stores, as well as directly at the electric company. The cost of electricity for a Mexican home can vary widely, depending upon the city and particular neighborhood in which the home is located. In lower middle class homes in the average city, electrical costs can run between $10-50 U.S. dollars per bill, while more affluent homes may spend upwards of $200. </p>
        <p><u> Water</u></p>
        <p> Water bills can vary as widely as electrical bills, running from as little as $5 every two months to as much as $50, depending not only on the local but also on whether the home is metered or pays for service at a fixed rate. There is also a common belief that water is not a service for which one ought to pay, but is a legal “right” that ought to be provided free of charge. This belief has led to a culture of non-payment of water bills in some areas. The issue of water becomes further charged by the fact that water reserves are concentrated in the southern part of the country, while most water consumption occurs in the arid central and northern parts. Thus water sometimes becomes a political issue, often preventing the expansion of services to communities without access to clean water. </p>
        <p> State owned water services (which include 2,400 municipal providers and various larger ones that serve 40-50 big cities) control about three quarters of the market, while private companies provide the rest. There are two regulators overseeing water utilities, the Comision Nacional del Agua (CNA) regulating water at the national level and the Sistema de Aguas regulating water in the nation’s capital, Mexico City. </p>
        <p><u> Water Pollution</u></p>
        <p> Not only is water availability a major issue in Mexico, but so is water quality. Water pollution from a variety of sources – from mining, industry, sewage, agricultural waste, among many others – has created numerous health problems, such as fatal cases of diarrhea. The problem has not been alleviated by receiving water from the U.S. Mexico has an agreement with the United States whereby Mexico gives the U.S. 350,000 acre feet of water from Rio Grande tributaries while the U.S. gives Mexico 1.5 million acre feet from the Colorado River. However, 
          the water reaching Mexico is polluted by U.S. agricultural run off: fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste. Water consequently has become a political issue with both foreign and domestic implications. In fact, the Mexican government has declared water quality a national security issue, and its desire to be seen as trying to address the problem has led it to host the 2006 World Water Summit, the first time the Summit has been held in the America continent. </p>
        <p><u> Natural Gas</u></p>
        <p> Natural gas is not piped directly into homes, but is delivered by trucks that regularly tour neighborhoods, often daily, ringing “gas bells” (or using a loudspeaker) to notify residents of their arrival. The price of gas is set by the federal government, and has increased substantially over the last few years. The reason for this is that gas production has failed to keep up with domestic consumption. In 2004, natural gas production was 47.3 billion cubic meters, while consumption was 55.1 billion cubic meters, resulting in the importation of 7.85 billion cubic meters. </p>

      <!-- Health Care -->
      <div> <a name="Health"></a>
        <h1 id="h3">Health Care</h1>
        <p> Mexico faces numerous health care challenges. While, for example, deaths resulting from diarrhea and respiratory infections have declined over the last half century, these afflictions continue to claim a large number of lives. Infant mortality is another serious problem, though government census data reveals a consistent decline in infant mortality from 1930 to 1990 (but with wide regional variations). Still, in 2004, the infant mortality rate in Mexico was 21.4%, while in the U.S. it was only 6.8%, according to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
          Another alarming figure is the maternal mortality rate. In 2002, according to the government’s own figures, Mexico documented maternal deaths at 6.2 per 10,000 live births, a stubborn statistic that has resisted many efforts to lower it over the years. (Other computations put this figure as high as 7-9 deaths per 10,000 live births.) The reason for this mortality rate is not hard to find: 20.8% of maternal deaths take place due to delivery in the home rather than in hospitals, 68.3% of the victims being women without access to medical services. </p>
        <p> On the positive side, diseases controlled by vaccination have markedly declined in Mexico. Moreover, life expectancy for adults in Mexico reaching 60 years of age, both male and female, is nearly comparable to that of their U.S. counterparts. In short, Mexico has made some gains over the years, but still lags behind other developed nations in widespread access to medical services to reduce preventable health problems. </p>
        <p> The reason for this lag is largely economic. Total public spending on health care rose from 40% in 1990 to 45% in 2002, the same as in the U.S. Still, compared to other Latin American countries with similar levels of economic development, Mexico spends far less per capita of GDP on health care. One reason for this is that private health insurance is virtually non-existent in Mexico. Health expenditures in the U.S. for 2002 break down to 45% paid by public expenditure, 36% by private insurance, and 14% by out-of-pocket funds; awhile in Mexico the numbers are 45% paid by public expenditure, only 3% by private insurance, and an astonishing 52% by out-of-pocket funds. Thus about half of all medical expenses are paid by the patient out of personal finances in a country where, according to the World Bank (describing Mexico’s economy in 2002), half the population is living in “poverty” and one fifth is living in “extreme poverty.” </p>
        <p> Moreover, the health care infrastructure is fragmented and unequally distributed throughout the country. The public health care system serves only select parts of the population and offers widely varying quality of care, while the private sector is large but generally unregulated. Half of Mexico’s population receives health care through governmental social security institutions, such as the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Socia (IMSS), covering private sector workers, and the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE), covering workers in the public sector. The Ministry of Health has relegated the population not covered by social security to individual states operating their own State Health Services, which run public hospitals and 
          clinics generally noted for their inferior services, and which often fail to provide needed drugs and medications. For the wealthy who can afford the costs, the private sector offers far better medical services. In fact, the private sector provides about a third of all hospital beds in the country, and nearly half of all private hospitals are concentrated in affluent Mexico City. </p>
        <p> The large disparity in health care coverage reflects economic, social, and ethnic disparities between the northern and southern states of Mexico, meaning that health care exists primarily in geographic areas with wealthier and socially more influential populations. Difficulty accessing Mexico’s health care system in many geographic regions explains, for example, the fact that nearly half of all maternal deaths take place in communities of 15,000 inhabitants or less, being especially concentrated in poorer southern states like Yucatan and Oaxaca. Restricted access to medical services also helps explain the fact that Mexico employed only 1.5 practicing doctors per 1,000 people in 2002. </p>

      <!-- Tourism -->
      <div> <a name="Tourism"></a>
        <h1 id="h4">Tourism</h1>
        <p> The tourist industry provides about 3.2 million jobs in Mexico, accounting for around 9.5% of all employment. It also accounts for approximately 8.2% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), most tourists coming from the U.S. to visit a handful of major tourist destinations such as Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, Cozumel, Los Cabos, and the famous Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza. Because tourism accounts for such a significant slice of Mexico’s economy, it is overseen by a large government bureaucracy, the Secretariat of State for Tourism, which supervises two largely autonomous bodies: FONATUR, which controls funds for tourism development, and the Mexican Tourism Board, which promotes tourism. </p>
        <p> Historically, tourists to Mexico visited mainly either Mexico City or exotic historical sites, such as the Mayan ruins in the Yucatan. Since the 1960s, though, beach resorts like Mazatlan have captured an increasingly large percentage of tourist dollars. The Mexican government accordingly encouraged the development of facilities at these resorts, such as airports and hotels. Still, the growth of Mexico’s tourism industry in the 1990s lagged behind the rest of the world’s tourism industry, spurring the government to initiate significant reforms. Traditional resort spots, such as Cancun, saw new development, while newer potential tourist spots, especially beaches in southern Mexico like Ixtapa and Huatulco, were systematically cultivated and promoted. By the year 2000, Mexico was rated the 8th most popular tourist destination in the world. </p>
        <p> The government’s stated strategy for tourist development during 2001-2006 involved engaging and nurturing local businesses, all developmental programs being geared toward specific objectives and with progress measured by a national system of indicators. The strategy targeted local development in a basically bottom up approach, committing over half of the government’s budget for tourism development to local tourist destinations. Ultimately, this resulted in a cafeteria approach in which the best projects could receive funds from the federal government, funds that might hopefully be matched by local authorities and by the tourist industry. Despite this innovative development program, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, resulted in a major reduction of tourists traveling from the U.S. to Mexico. However, tourism has since improved, and the World Travel & Tourism Council has forecasted an annual growth rate in Mexico’s tourist industry of 7.7% through the year 2012. </p>
