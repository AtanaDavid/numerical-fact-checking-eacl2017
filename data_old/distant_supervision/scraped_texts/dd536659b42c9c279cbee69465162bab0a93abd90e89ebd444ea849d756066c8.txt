12:00-13:00 we will be in Scaniasalen and hold a presentation about REACT and give you the opportunity to ask us questions in connection to the recruitment process.
To find Scaniasalen, enter the main entrance of the student union building and go up the stairs that are going to be in front of you - when you get to the 2nd floor, Scaniasalen is located on your left side.
Hope to see you there!
