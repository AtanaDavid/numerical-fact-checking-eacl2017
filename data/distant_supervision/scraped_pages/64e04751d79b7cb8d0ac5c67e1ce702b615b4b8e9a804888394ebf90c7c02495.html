Lessons ■ Overview
Public opinion polls regularly ﬁnd that medical professionals and the
public are dissatisﬁed with the system and believe major change is
necessary.
Windows can sometimes be mirrors. A look at health systems abroad can enable us to
develop a better understanding of our health system in the United States. An international perspective suggests that the United States has the most expensive health care Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 54 Part I. Health Policy system in the world, but unlike other wealthy countries, we fail to provide universal
health insurance coverage and experience large inequities in access to primary and
specialty care. Health care costs are often a source of financial strain, even bankruptcy,
for people with serious illness (Hacker, 2006), and Americans suffer from high rates
of mortality that could have been avoided with timely and appropriate access to a
range of effective health care services (Nolte &amp; McKee, 2012). There is also evidence
that the U.S. health care system squanders resources and fails to address many of its
population’s health care needs. Not surprisingly, public opinion polls regularly find
that medical professionals and the public are dissatisfied with the system and believe
major change is necessary (Blendon, Benson, &amp; Brulé, 2012). LOOKING ABROAD TO PROMOTE SELF-EXAMINATION AT HOME
International comparisons of health care system performance remind us that there
are workable alternatives to our current system. Examining other systems provides
“the gift of perspective” and helps us to understand our own system “by reference
to what it is like or unlike” (Marmor et al., 2005). As Rudolf Klein (1997, p. 1270)
explains:
Policy learning . . . is as much a process of self-examination—of reflecting on the
characteristics of one’s own country and health care system—as of looking at the
experience of others . . . the experience of other countries is largely valuable insofar
as it prompts a process of critical introspection by enlarging our sense of what is
possible and adding to our repertoire of possible policy tools. For policy learning is
not about the transfer of ideas or techniques . . . but about their adaptation to local
circumstances. (emphasis in original) This chapter attempts to provide a better understanding of the U.S. health care
system by comparing it to health systems in wealthy countries, which share many
characteristics in common, and by contrasting it to China, which is different. Our
focus on wealthy nations draws on the experience of those belonging to an organization based in Paris that studies economic trends and policies and collects health data
from member nations—the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We pay special attention to England,1 which operates a national health
service (NHS), and to Canada and France, which have national health insurance (NHI)
systems. Our focus on China is an example of so-called BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia,
India, and China) with large populations that have benefited from rapid economic
growth over the past two decades and now are demanding access to state-of-the-art
medical care.
Although England’s NHS is one of the most public systems in the world, it also
allows opportunities for private hospitals, private practice, and private insurance for
those who prefer such options. Canada is frequently compared with the United States
because of its physical proximity and similar political culture; until the mid-1960s,
Canada’s health care financing and delivery systems were nearly identical to those
in the United States (Marmor et al., 2005). France’s health system also shares many
1
We focus on England, the largest constituent country within the United Kingdom because there are important
differences among the NHS in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 55 features with the U.S. health system. Like the United States, France relies on a multipayer system for financing care and offers a mix of public and private providers for
delivering health care services. French citizens also enjoy freedom of choice among
providers—to an even greater extent than Americans. The French experience (Rodwin
&amp; Contributors, 2006) suggests that it is possible to achieve universal coverage without adopting a single-payer NHI system, such as Canada’s, or an NHS, as in England.
China offers a more striking contrast to the United States. Despite its rapidly growing economy, China’s national investments in public health and medical care are far
smaller than those of OECD nations, and out-of-pocket payments represent roughly
half of all health care expenditures. We conclude the chapter with some lessons of
comparative experience for U.S. policymakers. ■ Health System Models
NHS systems, such as those in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Finland,
Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece, may be traced back to Lord Beveridge,
who wrote the blueprint for the English NHS immediately after World War II. Although
such systems are characterized by a dominant share of financing derived from general
revenue taxes, this does not preclude other forms of financing. For example, the relative size of private financing and provision is much higher in Italy and Spain than in
Sweden or Denmark. In England, 76% of NHS funding comes from general taxation,
18% from a payroll tax, and the remainder from private payments (Thomson, Osborn,
Squires, &amp; Reed, 2012, p. 33). Historically, NHI systems have had a more open-ended
reimbursement system for health care providers, but this distinction is blurring as
NHI systems are increasingly under pressure to operate within budget limits.
NHI systems may be traced back to Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who established
the first NHI program for salaried industrial workers in Germany in 1883. With the
exception of Canada, whose dominant share of financing is from general tax revenues,
these systems are characterized by payroll tax–based financing. In addition to income
taxes, about a quarter of Canada’s federal spending on health care comes from corporations. The provinces also supplement income and corporate taxes with additional
sources of funding, such as sales, tobacco, and alcohol taxes. As with NHS systems, NHI
systems are characterized by significant variation in their financing and organizational
arrangements. For example, the share of French health care expenditures financed from
general tax revenues has increased beyond 40% (Rodwin &amp; Contributors, 2006).
Whether one’s image of a health system is private and market-based, as in the
United States and Switzerland; public and government-managed, as in the United
Kingdom and Scandinavian nations; or at some intermediary point along such a continuum, as in France and Canada; it is possible to make some useful distinctions with
respect to the public versus the private provision of health care and methods of financing of health services. Table 4.1 classifies health systems along these dimensions. PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES
The arrangements for providing health care in Table 4.1 distinguish whether health
services are delivered by the public, private not-for-profit, or private for-profit sector.
Within these categories, many distinctions may be added. For example, some publicly

C capitalized organizations (row A) are national (VHA), others are subnational (state
mental hospitals), and many are local (municipal hospitals). Likewise, the not-forprofit category may include a variety of quasi-public organizations, such as hospital
trusts in Britain (row B). The for-profit form of provision (row C), a distinctive subcategory in the United States, includes private for-profit hospitals and managed care
organizations (MCOs) that sell ownership shares to investors through stock markets.
Indeed, the growth of large investor-owned MCOs distinguishes the United States
from most other OECD nations. FINANCING
The four methods of raising revenues to pay for health services correspond to columns
A through D:
■
■
■
■ A: General revenue financing through the fiscal tax system
B: Compulsory payroll tax financing through the Social Security (payroll tax) system
C: Voluntary premiums assessed by private health insurance companies
D: Individual out-of-pocket payments There are, of course, other methods and sources of financing, particularly for capital expenditures, such as direct employer contributions and philanthropic funds. But
these are no longer dominant sources of health care financing.
Although all countries rely on these four sources of revenue to finance health
care services, most developed countries have adopted one of two distinct models
for financing care. In NHS systems, the government uses its resources to operate
most, if not all, of the delivery system. In NHI systems, revenue is most often raised
through payroll taxes to fund a social insurance program that reimburses health
care providers for services rather than paying for health care directly through the
government’s budget. Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 57 In contrast to England, Canada, and France, China and the United States rely,
to varying degrees, on subnational and local governments to finance health care. In
Canada, provinces and territories administer universal health insurance programs and
the federal government provides block grants that account for approximately 20% of
health care expenditures. To qualify for the federal funds, provincial and territorial
health insurance systems must meet five criteria specified by the Canada Health Act
of 1984. They must be (a) administered on a nonprofit basis by a public authority;
(b) comprehensive in the sense that they must cover most health services provided
by hospitals, medical practitioners, or dentists; (c) universal in that all legal Canadian
residents are covered; (d) portable so that coverage for all residents in each province
or territory is transferable to all other parts of Canada; and (e) accessible, although
“reasonable access” is not defined in the law.
In 2009, China adopted a reform that seeks to provide health insurance for all of
its population. Although China already provides some minimal health insurance to
the majority of its population, coverage remains extremely limited and, as we noted
earlier, more than half of all spending on health care still comes from out-of-pocket
payments (Table 4.1, column D). In terms of public funding for health care, China
relies—to an even greater extent than Canada—on subnational government revenues
to finance the country’s three national health insurance funds.
Below the national government, China has provincial, regional, and local governments. By the mid-1990s, these subnational government authorities financed 80% to
90% of total government spending on social services, including health care (Hipgravel
et al., 2012). The adoption of health reform has increased central government contributions to health care, but local government taxes and out-of-pocket payments
from individual patients still represent the two largest sources of revenue. As of 2012,
provincial and local government revenues financed 78% of health care expenditures
(Fabre, 2013). This approach has exacerbated the large economic disparities between
the wealthier coastal provinces and the poorer rural provinces in western China. The
national government has attempted to address the country’s rural–urban disparities,
but with limited success (Jian, Chan, Reidpath, &amp; Xu, 2010). ■ NHS and NHI Systems Compared With the United States
Table 4.1 enables one to highlight key features of NHS and NHI systems and to
adopt an international perspective on the U.S. health care system. The most striking difference between the United States and NHS or NHI systems is that the United
States—even after passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010
(ACA)—includes large elements of financing that are based on actuarial principles
whereby private insurance premiums (column C) are set with respect to estimated
risk. In contrast, in NHS and NHI systems, most health care financing is based on
ability to pay (columns A and B). Ability-to-pay criteria lead to wealthier, younger, and
healthier individuals paying disproportionately to finance the care of poorer, older,
and sicker individuals. Aside from this important distinction, a look at box 1 through
box 12 suggests that most health care systems have elements of many boxes ranging
from socialized medicine (box 1) to out-of-pocket payment for private practitioners
and hospitals (box 12). Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 58 Part I. Health Policy The United States has neither an NHS nor an NHI system. Instead, the U.S. health
care system relies on a patchwork of public and private insurance with large gaps in
coverage (see Chapter 3). Its enormous pluralism exhibits components of its health
system within each of the boxes in Table 4.1. It uses a social insurance system for
older people and for those with permanent disabilities (Medicare: columns A and B); a
social welfare system for some people with low incomes (Medicaid and CHIP, column
B); and a subsidized employer-based private health insurance system for a large, but
shrinking percentage of salaried employees in the private and public sectors (column
C). Along with its public and private insurance programs, the United States has elements of socialized medicine (publicly funded and provided programs in box 1), such
as the military health care system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system,
and the Indian Health Service (IHS) for Native American and Alaskan Native people. ■ The Health Systems in England, Canada, France, and China After World War II, governments have gradually extended their role in the
ﬁnancing and provision of health services. Beyond the differences we have noted between NHI and NHS systems, these systems
have evolved in similar directions. After World War II, governments have gradually
extended their role in the financing and provision of health services. What was once
largely the responsibility of the family, philanthropy, religious institutions, employers,
and local governments has largely been taken over by national and subnational governments—a trend that has accompanied the rise of the welfare state (de Kervasdoué,
Kimberly, &amp; Rodwin, 1984). This evolution has affected all wealthy OECD nations and,
increasingly, BRIC and less developed nations. The U.S. reliance on employer-based
private health insurance—even after the implementation of the ACA—is an important
contrast to NHI and NHS systems. Yet even in the United States recent decades have
seen an expansion of public insurance and a decline in employer-based coverage.
The growth of government involvement in health systems has characterized
OECD nations during the great boom years of health sector growth (1950s and 1960s),
when governments encouraged hospital construction and modernization, workforce
training, and biomedical research. It continued in the 1970s, when the goals of OECD
countries shifted more in the direction of rationalization and cost containment (Rodwin, 1984). In the early 21st century, public and private health insurance has become
the dominant source for funding health care, and public expenditure on health care
services, along with education and Social Security, has become one of the largest categories of social expenditure as a share of gross domestic product (GDP).
In contrast to these trends in OECD nations, by the end of the 1970s China moved
from a health system dominated by public financing to one that is now dominated
by private, out-of-pocket payments. Between 1949 and the early 1980s, the Chinese
health system was financed largely by the central government and state-owned enterprises ( Valentine, 2005). In 1978, Deng Xiaoping called for market reforms. The central government reduced its share of national health care spending from 32% to 15%
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 59 (Blumenthal &amp; Hsiao, 2005). It slashed subsidies to public hospitals and introduced
market mechanisms in health care, resulting in rapid growth of out-of-pocket payments and income-based inequities.
By the late 1990s, Chinese officials increased investment in public health to
address growing disparities between rural and urban areas. Efforts to improve the
public health and primary care systems accelerated after the outbreak of SARS in late
2002. By the end of 2003, more than 5,000 people were infected with SARS and 349
people died (Smith, 2006), thus exposing the weaknesses of the public health system.
Since 2009, China has continued to expand the role of government through the creation of new public insurance schemes and the adoption of new public health regulations (Wang, Gusmano, &amp; Cao, 2011).
In addition to the growth of government’s role in health care, most OECD nations
must confront common challenges and exhibit distinct approaches for many issues.
We illustrate how this is so by comparing the health systems of England, Canada,
France, and China with respect to (a) provider payment, (b) coordination of care,
(c) workforce and IT, and most importantly, (d) health system performance. PROVIDER PAYMENT
All countries rely on multiple methods for paying physicians and hospitals. NHS systems traditionally have relied more on salaried and capitation forms of payment for
physicians and budgets for hospitals. In the English NHS, about two thirds of general
practitioners (GPs) and dentists work as independent contractors reimbursed through
a blended payment system, 75% from capitation payment and most of the rest (20%)
from fee-for-service (FFS) payments based on performance. Since 2012, GPs have
been placed in charge of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), which control about
70% of the NHS budget. CCGs are responsible for purchasing hospital and specialty
medical care services for their patients. The NHS first introduced a prospective payment system for reimbursing public and private hospitals in 2003 and, in April 2004,
phased in a new national tariff system. Since 2012, the NHS has adopted a Payment
by Results (PbR) system based on the average cost of providing the procedure or the
treatment across the NHS as a whole.
Historically, Canadian primary care physicians have been paid on an FFS basis.
The Ministries of Health for all provinces and territories are responsible for negotiating an annual physician fee schedule based on a relative value scale (RVS) for each
reimbursable procedure or code. The RVS may be based on a resource-based fee
schedule (RBFS), which tries to capture the inputs required to provide the service, or
on historical charges. Studies have found wide variation in fee schedules across Canada
(Roth &amp; Adams, 2009). In more recent years, some provinces have experimented with
blended capitation schemes in family health networks, family health teams, and family
health organizations. Blended capitation relies on age- and gender-adjusted payments,
coupled with financial incentives to follow “evidence-based” guidelines and FFS when
physicians treat nonenrolled patients (HealthForceOntario, 2014).
In France, physicians in the ambulatory sector and in private hospitals are reimbursed on the basis of a fee schedule negotiated among physician associations, NHI
funds, and the government. Approximately 15% of all physicians (and 25% of those
in private office–based practice) selected the option to extra-bill beyond the negotiated fees that represent payment in full for all other physicians. These figures vary by
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 60 Part I. Health Policy specialty, with the highest rates of extra-billing among specialists in comparison to
GPs. Physicians who have opted to extra-bill may do so as long as their charges are
set with “tact and measure,” a standard that has never been legally defined but which
has been found, empirically, to represent a 50% to 100% increase to the negotiated
fees. Physicians based in public hospitals are remunerated on a part-time or full-time
salaried basis, and those in private for-profit hospitals may bill the NHI based on the
negotiated fees.
Before 1984, public hospitals in France were reimbursed on the basis of a retrospective, cost-based, per diem fee; after that, they were placed on global budgets
that were later gradually adjusted for patient case mix in the 1990s. Private for-profit
hospitals used to be reimbursed on the basis of a negotiated per diem fee; in the 1990s
the per diem payments were also gradually adjusted for their case mix. The basis
for case-based adjustment in France is an adaptation of the U.S. Diagnosis Related
Group (DRG) categories known in France as GHM (groupes homogènes de malades).
The most recent modification was introduced in 2004 (Schreyögg et al., 2006), when
activity-based payment (ABP) was introduced to create a level playing field for reimbursement of acute-care services among public and private hospitals. As of 2012, the
reimbursement system for public and private hospitals has been completely aligned
based on the national ABP tariffs, which take into account each hospital’s historical
costs. This has resulted in expected activity growth, which in turn, results in downward price adjustments because annual hospital costs are constrained by national and
regional hospital expenditure targets (Or, 2010).
In China, the expansion of health insurance is changing the nature of provider payment, but by the end of 2013 about half of physician payments to health care providers
still came from FFS payments. Subnational governments in China regulate prices in an
effort to make health care affordable and, during the past decade, provincial and local
governments, with encouragement from the central government, have introduced
such incentives as pay-for-performance based on treatment protocols to improve
quality (Yip et al., 2010). Although the central government hopes that the expansion
of health insurance will limit hospital reliance on kickback payments from medical
device and pharmaceutical companies, such payments continue to be an important
source of revenue for Chinese health care providers (Wang et al., 2011). Two of the distinguishing characteristics of the U.S. health care system
are that the United States does not operate within a budget and does not
negotiate prices with providers as aggressively as other countries. In comparison to England, Canada, France, and China, the United States pays
significantly higher prices for medical care. Although there is a vigorous debate about
the factors that drive U.S. health care spending, consensus is emerging that price is the
most important factor in explaining why the United States spends so much more than
any other health care system in the world (Anderson, Frogner, Johns, &amp; Reinhardt,
2006). Two of the distinguishing characteristics of the U.S. health care system are that
the United States does not operate within a budget and does not negotiate prices with
providers as aggressively as other countries. Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 61 COORDINATION OF CARE
All countries suffer from problems of coordination among hospitals and communitybased services. They differ, nonetheless, with regard to the size and nature of their
delivery systems. France, for example, has more practicing doctors per 1,000 population (3.3) than the United Kingdom (2.8), the United States (2.5), Canada (2.4), or
China (1.5) (OECD, 2013). France also has more hospital beds per 1,000 population
(6.2) than the United States (3.1), the United Kingdom (3.0), Canada (2.8), or China
(2.7) (OECD, 2013).
Since its creation in 1948, the NHS has been one of the largest public service organizations in Europe. With more than one million employees, more than 2,500 hospitals, and a host of intermediary health care organizations, the NHS poses an awesome
managerial challenge (Klein, 2013). Perhaps because Britain has fewer health care
resources than most OECD nations, the British have been more aggressive in weeding out inefficiency than other, wealthier countries. Because the NHS faces the same
demands as other systems to make technology available and to care for an increasingly
aged population, British policymakers recognize they must pursue innovations that
improve efficiency. But numerous obstacles have arisen: opposition by professional
bodies, difficulties in firing and redeploying health care personnel, and not least, the
tripartite structure of the NHS, which, since its inception, has created an institutional
separation among hospitals, general practitioners, and community health programs.
This separation is reinforced further by the fact that local authorities are responsible
for a great deal of prevention and health promotion, as well as social care, making it
difficult to integrate hospital and community-based care.
In Canada less separation exists between physicians and hospitals because specialists are paid FFS and work both in community-based practice and hospitals. Hospitals are largely private nonprofit institutions with their own governing boards, but
they are almost entirely publicly financed and subject to tight budget constraints.
Most community-based physicians must refer their patients requiring diagnostic procedures and testing, as well as more specialized care, to local hospitals, which can lead
to extended waiting times for elective procedures and problems in ensuring optimal
coordination between hospital specialists and community-based providers.
France also faces problems with the coordination of care between hospitals and
community-based providers. There is inadequate communication between full-time,
salaried physicians in public hospitals and solo physicians working in private practice.
Although GPs have informal referral networks to specialists and public hospitals, no
formal institutional relationships exist to ensure continuity of medical care, disease
prevention and health promotion services, posthospital follow-up care, or systematic
linkages and referral patterns among primary-, secondary-, and tertiary-level services. Schoen et al. (2012) document that the French health care system is characterized by poor hospital discharge planning and a lack of coordination among medical
providers.
In China, before 1978 the health care delivery system in rural areas was organized
by communes, which provided housing, education, and social services, as well as basic
medical care. An important feature of the communes’ Cooperative Medical System
was the staff of paraprofessionals known as “barefoot doctors”’ (Rosenthal &amp; Greiner,
1982). Most of the barefoot doctors were young peasants who received a few months
of training and offered basic primary and preventive care, including health education. Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 62 Part I. Health Policy If the needs of patients were more complex, the barefoot doctors would refer them
to physicians at the commune health centers or, if necessary, to the closest hospital.
In urban areas, the health care delivery system relied heavily on so-called first-level
hospitals, community clinics with a modest inpatient capacity, to provide ambulatory
care.
With the introduction of market mechanisms in the health sector after 1978, the
government ended its barefoot doctor program in rural areas, leaving the population
in rural China without adequate access to health care services. It also reduced its subsidies to state-owned first-level hospitals; forced to become more self-reliant, these
hospitals withdrew public health and primary health care services. Some first-level
hospitals went bankrupt, and those that survived turned to profitable medical services
rather than emphasize primary care and prevention. WORKFORCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Primary care vs. specialty care balance. In most OECD health care systems, at least
half of physicians are in primary care. The United States stands out, in contrast,
because about 70% of physicians are specialists, and only about 30% are in primary
care. The situation in China is far more dramatic. Only 57% of cities in China had a
community-based primary care organization, and more than 40% of the population
reports that it does not have convenient access to a primary care center (Wang et al.,
2011). In addition, most general practitioners lack additional training after receiving
their undergraduate medical education.
Primary care is important because systems with a higher concentration of primary
care practitioners improve coordination and continuity of care. Access to an effective
system of primary care appears to result in higher life expectancy projection at birth,
lower infant mortality, lower mortality from all causes, lower disease-specific mortality, and higher self-reported health status (Starfield, Shi, &amp; Macinko, 2005).
Workforce shortages/surpluses. Concerns about the adequacy of primary care in
the United States are reinforced by discussions about the adequacy of the health and
social care workforce in the face of rapid population aging (Carrier, Yee, &amp; Stark, 2011).
Increases in Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia in particular have raised
concerns about the extent to which the health and long-term care systems will have a
sufficient number of physicians, nurses, and other medical professionals to address the
needs of an aging society (Warshaw &amp; Bragg, 2014).
Although a shortage of clinicians, particularly in primary care, is the major concern in the United States, France, and China, some countries in Europe, particularly
England, now wonder whether they may have too many doctors and nurses. Before
the global economic crisis began in 2008, many OECD countries adopted policies
designed to increase their supply of medical professionals. After the economic slowdown, many countries expressed concern about an “oversupply” of some health care
workers (Ono, Lafortune, &amp; Schoenstein, 2013).
Starting in 2000, for example, the English National Health Service adopted a
workforce redesign initiative to increase the number of doctors and nurses in the system, expand the roles of existing professionals, and redistribute responsibilities to rely
more on teams of health care professionals. As a result, there is now concern that
the country may have too many hospital specialists, but there are persistent concerns
that it still does not have a large enough supply of well-trained social care workers,
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 63 particularly for providing home care to older patients (Bohmer &amp; Imison, 2013). Similarly, a recent assessment of health care needs in Ontario, Canada, concluded that
there will be an aggregate surplus of GPs and specialists in 20 years, even though some
specialties and areas may experience shortages (Singh et al., 2010).
The push for electronic medical records and other forms of health care IT. Throughout the world, policymakers are searching for ways to reduce health care spending while
improving the quality of care. The use of electronic health records and other forms of
health information technology (HIT) are often touted as solutions to these problems.
Harvey Fineberg (2012), the president of the Institute of Medicine, argues that over the
long term HIT will improve the quality and efficiency of the health care system. Marmor
and Oberlander (2012, p. 1217) dismiss the focus on HIT as a “fad” and suggest that
the desire to find a “big fix” to the problems of cost and quality has led policy makers to
embrace technical and managerial solutions, including the adoption of HIT, along with
various forms of managed care, health planning, and payment reforms designed to align
the incentives of providers and patients with public health goals.
This argument supports James Morone’s (1993) thesis that the United States tends
to search for a “painless prescription” to the major challenges in health care. Indeed,
comparative analysis suggests that such technical solutions to the problems of cost
and quality as HIT have had little effect on cost or quality in health care and that the
United States should focus on more important structural features of other health care
systems, such as global budgets, fee schedules, systemwide payment rules, and concentrated purchasing power.
Advocates of HIT argue that newer developments in the use of so-called big data
are more likely to transform medical practice because of their capacity to link information among many institutions within a health care system. They also argue that the
United States has never adopted HIT on a widespread basis, so the failure of previous
efforts to improve quality or lower costs is not sufficient evidence that HIT cannot
contribute to these goals in the future.
It seems plausible to suggest that HIT may be a valuable tool for addressing costs
and quality in health care, but its value surely depends on the policy context in which
it is used. For England, Canada, and France, HIT may further enhance the efficiency of
resource allocation by providing administrators, providers, and patients with access to
better information. In the United States, however, the effect of HIT within the context
of a fragmented, open-ended financing system may be far more limited. Viewed from
this perspective, it is easier to understand the arguments of those who remain skeptical of HIT’s importance. HEALTH SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
Policymakers and researchers often want to compare the performance of different
systems and identify lessons for health policy. Although these efforts have generated
important information, they have often succumbed to the temptation of devising a
composite indicator to rank health care systems against one another (Oliver, 2012).
This practice encourages lavish attention from the media on the search for the best
health care system, the new holy grail of performance assessments. Unfortunately, such
an approach lacks any effort to understand, assess, and compare health care systems
in relation to the cultural context, values, and institutions within which performance
indicators are embedded.
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 64 Part I. Health Policy The study of health system performance by the World Health Organization
(WHO) is the most prominent example of the composite indicator approach to the
comparative analysis of health systems (WHO, 2000). WHO ranked the health systems
of 191 member states based on weighted measures of five objectives: (a) maximizing
population health (as calculated by disability-adjusted life expectancy, or DALE);
(b) reducing inequalities in population health; (c) maximizing health system responsiveness; (d) reducing inequalities in responsiveness; and (e) financing health care
equitably.
Although controversial because of its many methodological flaws and missing
data, the WHO report generated tremendous discussion about health system performance and the criteria that should be used to assess it (Musgrove, 2003). Some of
the controversy generated by the report can be attributed to complaints from countries unhappy with their ranking, but prominent academics also criticized the study
for relying on incomplete and inadequate data, as well as on questionable methods
( Williams, 2001).
WHO’s use of DALE as a measure of health status illustrates the problem of using
population health status to assess the performance of health care systems. DALE
includes causes of mortality that are amenable to health care as well as a host of social
determinants of health. As a result, this measure is not “related directly to the health
care system” (Nolte &amp; McKee, 2003, p. 1129). Using DALE, life expectancy at birth and
infant mortality are inadequate measures of health system performance because the
role of health care in improving population health is small compared with interventions aimed at social and environmental determinants.
As Bradley and Taylor (2013) argue, one reason the United States performs so
poorly on such indicators is because it has failed to invest sufficiently in education,
housing, employment, and other social programs that help to produce and sustain
good health. Between those who emphasize the decisive effect of social determinants
of health and those who focus on access to health care, there is a middle ground: attention not only to the consequences of poor social conditions, but also to barriers in
access to what we have called effective health care services.
There is a vast literature that measures inequities in access to health care (see
Chapter 2). Such studies rely either on comparisons of inputs (e.g., physicians, hospital beds) or on administrative or self-reported survey data to measure service utilization. An alternative approach attempts to capture the consequences of poor access to
disease prevention, primary care, and specialty services—in other words, mortality
amenable to health care (amenable mortality). Of course, few causes of death are
entirely amenable, or not amenable to health care, and as medical therapies improve
even more deaths may be classified as potentially avoidable. Nevertheless, based on
an OECD study, this summary provides convincing evidence that the United States
is not performing well in comparison to other wealthy nations (Gay, Paris, Devaux,
&amp; de Looper, 2011).
Crossnational analysis of trends in avoidable mortality indicate that avoidable
deaths have declined much faster over the last three decades than other causes of
mortality (Nolte &amp; McKee, 2012). This result lends further credence to the validity
of avoidable mortality as an indicator for the effectiveness of public health interventions and medical care. We have used this measure to compare the health systems in
megacities located within four of the countries we highlight in this chapter: London,
New York, Paris, and Shanghai (Gusmano, Weisz, &amp; Rodwin, 2009).
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 65 Through accountable care organizations (ACOs) in the United States (see
Chapter 11) and various forms of disease management and integrated service delivery
proposals in other countries, health care professionals are being encouraged to think
about population, as well as individual, health. The effort to shift health systems in this
direction is a positive development, but if we hope to understand the performance of
health care systems and the relationship between health care inputs and health outputs, it is important to select such indicators as amenable mortality, which are more
closely related to the performance of these systems than are broad measures of health
such as life expectancy and DALEs.
The extensive criticism of WHO’s effort to evaluate health system performance has
not discouraged other groups from taking similar approaches. The Commonwealth Fund
has a project designed to identify high-performing health systems within the United
States and other wealthy nations. It also draws on more dependable data than WHO’s
for its assessments, in part because its scope is more limited and focuses on nations for
which population, health, and health system data are more readily available. For example,
the Commonwealth Fund supplements many of the same data sources used by WHO
with original surveys of patients and primary care providers fielded by Harris Interactive.
The Commonwealth Fund (2014) uses these survey results, along with a host of
other data sources, to compare U.S. national averages on health outcomes, quality,
access, efficiency, and equity to “benchmarks,” which represent the performance on
these measures “achieved by top-performing groups” (Schoen, Davis, How, &amp; Schoenbaum, 2006). In some cases, the “top-performing groups” are other countries. In other
cases, they are regions, states, or health plans within the United States. Despite the
more reliable empirical analysis and its contribution to stimulating attention to health
care systems abroad, this study’s use of a single national scorecard to evaluate the performance of the U.S. health system shares many of the same problems highlighted by
WHO’s effort to rank health systems on the basis of criteria about which policymakers
rarely agree.
Access to services across income groups. An important dimension of health system
performance is the extent to which a system provides access to health care services
by income group. In contrast to the United States, countries with universal or nearuniversal coverage enjoy a relatively equitable distribution of primary care visits (Van
Doorslaer, Masseria, &amp; the OECD Health Equity Research Group Members, 2004).
Lower-income residents of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, for example, are less likely to report barriers to health care than people with
below-median incomes in the United States (Blendon et al., 2002). Comparative studies that examine hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC), a
measure of access to timely and effective primary care, find that rates are much lower
in Canada, England, France, and Germany than in the United States and inequalities
in rates of ACSC are smaller in these countries (Billings, Anderson, &amp; Newman, 1996;
Gusmano, Rodwin, &amp; Weisz, 2014; Roos, Walld, Uhanova, &amp; Bond, 2005).
A concern often voiced by conservative analysts in the United States is that socalled government-run health care systems, by which they mean both NHS and NHI
systems, “ration” care (Goodman, Musgrave, &amp; Herrick, 2004). Because such systems operate within a budget, these analysts claim, they must limit access to specialty and surgical health care services in ways that are unacceptable. This claim is
supported by studies that compare access to certain expensive health care services
in England and the United States (Aaron, Schwartz, &amp; Cox, 2005). Although there is
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 66 Part I. Health Policy evidence that some expensive technologies, including revascularization and kidney
dialysis, are used less frequently in England than in the United States (Gusmano &amp;
Allin, 2011), this is not the case with respect to France or Germany. For example, after
controlling for need, the use of revascularization (coronary artery bypass and angioplasty) is comparable in France, Germany, and the United States (Gusmano et al.,
2014).
Even among countries that provide universal coverage there are differences in
access to specialty services by socioeconomic status. Residents of higher-income
neighborhoods in Winnipeg, Canada, a country that strives to eliminate financial barriers to care, receive “substantially more” specialty and surgical care than lower-income
residents of the city (Roos &amp; Mustard, 1997). In France, Germany, and England, access
to some specialty health care services is significantly worse among residents of lowerincome neighborhoods (Gusmano, Weisz, &amp; Rodwin, 2009). Inequalities in access
to health care are even greater in BRIC countries and developing nations. Despite
remarkable economic growth in recent decades, for example, there are flagrant disparities in access to health care within China.
Cost. As was evident during the debates over the ACA, there is a widely shared
belief among American policymakers that a national program providing for universal entitlement to health care in the United States would result in runaway costs. In
response to this presumption, nations that entitle all of their residents to a high level
of medical care, while spending less on administration and on health care than the
United States, are often held up as models. The Canadian health system is the most
celebrated example. French NHI is another case in point. England’s NHS, although
typically considered a “painful prescription” for the United States (Aaron, Schwartz,
&amp; Cox, 2005), nevertheless ensures first-dollar coverage for basic health services to its
entire population and, as we have seen, spends less than half as much on health care,
as a percent of GDP, and approximately one half as much per capita as in the United
States (Table 4.2). Huang (2011) expects that China’s total health care expenditures
will increase rapidly over the coming decade, but its current spending, as a percent of
GDP, is far below the OECD average.
Stories in the media often suggest that pressures from population aging will
render existing welfare state commitments, including the Medicare and Medicaid
programs in the United States, unsustainable. Despite these concerns, most studies TABLE 4.2 HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURE AS A SHARE OF GDP: SELECTED COUNTRIES, 2011 Health Expenditure as a Share of GDP, 2011
United States 17.7% France 11.6% Canada 11.2% United Kingdom 9.4% OECD Average 9.3% China 5.2% Source: Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (2013). Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 67 conclude there is no correlation between the percentage of the older population
(65 years and over) and health care expenditures as a percent of GDP. The United
States, which spends more on health care than any country in the world, is among the
OECD countries with the youngest age cohorts. In contrast, Britain, Italy, Sweden,
Germany, and France, with older populations than the United States, spend a far
lower percentage of GDP on health care. Even if one excludes the United States and
examines only the European Union, there is no correlation between population aging
and health care spending.
Crossnational analysis of health care expenditure data indicates that, after controlling for income, age has little effect on national health care expenditures. Proximity to death, not age, leads to an increase in health spending (Moon, 1996). An
analysis of health spending on older people in Switzerland found that expenditures
are concentrated in the last few months of life (Zweifel, Felder, &amp; Meiers, 1999).
Although the OECD projects that “age-related spending for the average country
will rise by around 6 to 7 percentage points of GDP between 2000 and 2050,” they
acknowledge that “part of this pressure is a result of cost pressures from advances
in medical technologies, rather than ageing per se” (Australian Department of the
Treasury, 2007).
Price, volume, and technology diffusion are the most important factors that drive
health care costs; as noted earlier, however, high U.S. prices explain why the U.S.
health care system is so expensive relative to other nations (Anderson et al., 2006).
Although Americans spend more than any other nation, health service use in the
United States is actually below the median for the OECD on most measures. A study
for the McKinsey Global Institute (Angrisano, Farrell, Kocher, Laboissiere, &amp; Parker,
2007), based on four diseases, provides further support for the role of prices in driving up U.S. health care costs. The study found that in 1990, Americans spent about
66% more per capita on health care than Germans but received 15% fewer real health
care resources.
In addition to understanding the factors that drive health care spending, it
is important to confront the question: How much spending on health care is too
much? Most health economists argue that there is no right amount of money to
spend on health care. Cutler (2007) argues that we should focus less on the level of
health care expenditure and pay greater attention to whether the expenditures generate more benefits than costs. However, efforts to adopt explicit economic evaluation of health technology provoked controversy in the United States. The ACA
forbids federal government agencies from using cost as a criterion for making coverage decisions. Among the countries compared in this chapter, France, Canada,
and England, to varying degrees, all use economic evaluations of health technology
to make coverage decisions. In France, economic evaluations of new drugs are recommended but not required (Sorenson, 2009). In Canada, these efforts are more
decentralized than in England, and “only a handful” of technologies are subject to
cost-effectiveness analysis (Menon &amp; Stafinski, 2009). In England, NICE focuses on
new technologies only and is reputed to be the leading health technology assessment agency worldwide.
NICE, established in 1999 in response to growing concerns about variations in
the use of new technology, is supposed to meet three primary objectives: (a) to reduce
unwarranted variation in prescribing patterns across England and Wales, principally through setting practice guidelines; (b) to encourage the diffusion and uptake
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 68 Part I. Health Policy of effective health technologies; and (c) to ensure value for money for NHS investment by assessing the cost effectiveness of selected interventions. Record increases
in NHS expenditures throughout the decade following 2000 were linked to meeting
these objectives, particularly in terms of directing spending to facilitate widespread
and uniform access to the most cost-effective treatments.
NICE prides itself on its transparency, methodological rigor, stakeholder inclusiveness, consistency, independence from government, and timeliness, all of which
appear necessary to secure the legitimacy and effectiveness of its recommendations.
Since 2003, it has been mandatory for local NHS purchasers and providers to act on
all positive recommendations on technology appraisals (i.e., recommendations that
specific health care interventions be made available in the NHS) within 3 months of
their publication.
NICE arrives at conclusions about whether interventions are therapeutically
beneficial and cost-effective compared with other relevant alternatives by reviewing a range of available evidence, assembled and synthesized by a publicly funded
network of academic institutions. The role of social values in the appraisal process
is increasingly apparent as NICE reviews complex cases, for instance, on whether
select end-of-life cancer drugs be made available to NHS patients despite their offering insufficient value for money with respect to conventionally accepted thresholds
of cost-effectiveness.
There is some evidence that widespread adoption of NICE recommendations for
specific technologies, particularly cancer drugs and the use of varenicline for smoking
cessation, has reduced geographic variations in access to the technologies (Chalkidou,
2009). Also, there is evidence that NICE guidance has increased costs to the NHS,
which is not surprising because most cost-effective interventions are more expensive
than the alternatives. This does not bode well for those in the United States who hope
that economic evaluation of health technology will contain the growth of health care
costs, particularly if assessment efforts are disproportionately focused on new, expensive technologies. Chalkidou (2009) estimates that since its creation, NICE’s decisions
have cost more than £1.5 billion a year. In this context, it should be noted that cost
containment was never one of NICE’s explicit objectives.
Quality. The focus on quality is a relatively recent phenomenon. For many years,
the primary concern of most policymakers, particularly in developed countries, was
on overcoming financial barriers to the health care system. In 2002, the OECD created
the Health Care Quality Indicators (HCQI) project to develop and implement a set of
international indicators. The project includes representatives from 23 of the 30 OECD
nations, as well as a number of international partners, including the Commonwealth
Fund, the Nordic Council of Ministers Quality Project, and the International Society
for Quality in Health Care (ISQua). The project team identified five priority areas for
monitoring quality: (a) cardiac care, (b) diabetes mellitus, (c) mental health, (d) patient
safety, and (e) primary care and prevention/health promotion. The OECD secretariat
asked participating countries to identify expert panelists to review potential indicators
(Mattke, Epstein, &amp; Leatherman, 2006). The panels were charged with reviewing existing indicators rather than developing entirely new measures. They used a consensus
process and selected 86 indicators on the basis of relevance—including the extent to
which the health system can influence the indicator—scientific soundness, and feasibility. Not surprisingly, the project has identified significant variation in quality as
measured by these indicators (OECD, 2010).
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 69 Even in countries with relatively well-developed health data systems, it
is often difﬁcult to link data with unique patient identiﬁers in ways that
allow researchers and policymakers to understand quality of care across
different episodes of care and different providers. Some quality indicators, such as leaving a foreign body inside patients during surgery, follow directly from the literature on medical errors that can be influenced by a
health system. The relationships between health system quality and other indicators,
however, are controversial. For example, higher rates of 5-year survival among patients
diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer may reflect better access to high-quality cancer
care. It is possible, however, that these outcomes may reflect more aggressive efforts
to diagnose patients with cancer and have little to do with the quality of care patients
receive. Beyond these conceptual issues, countries continue to struggle with a lack of
relevant data for quality monitoring. Even in countries with relatively well-developed
health data systems, it is often difficult to link data with unique patient identifiers in
ways that allow researchers and policymakers to understand quality of care across different episodes of care and different providers (OECD, 2010).
In 2010, the United Kingdom’s coalition government published a white paper
entitled Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS, which called for the measurement of health outcomes based on a number of specific indicators. To achieve this
goal, England has developed the NHS Outcomes Framework (Secretary of State for
Health, 2014) with indicators that will be used to evaluate local health care arrangements across five different domains: (a) preventing people from dying prematurely;
(b) enhancing the quality of life for people with long-term conditions; (c) helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or after injury; (d) ensuring that people have
a positive experience of care; and (e) treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm.
In France the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), or National Authority for Health,
was established in 2004 as an independent public organization to promote quality
of health services through accreditation, certification, and development of practice
guidelines. Today, HAS leads the European Network for Patient Safety (EUNetPaS),
which has developed a common agenda to promote patient safety. After a contaminated blood scandal in the early 1990s, the French government established new institutions to conduct disease surveillance and protect the population from unsafe foods,
unsafe drugs, and unsafe blood. In addition, France’s Ministry of Health recently initiated a small number of aggressive safety campaigns with strong patient involvement,
such as one supported by TV spots to improve the use of antibiotics in preventing the
appearance of resistant bacteria. Based on a risk-scoring system for surgical wound
infections, national prevalence rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) in France declined from 2001 (33%) to 2006 (27%). These results are impressive in comparison with other European countries and the United States, where MRSA
infections have increased (Degos &amp; Rodwin, 2011).
In 1994, the Canadian government established the Canadian Institute for Health
Information (CIHI) to improve its capacity to assess the health care system and to identify standards for health system performance. CIHI maintains 27 databases and clinical
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC 70 Part I. Health Policy registries. The agency receives funding from the federal (80%) and provincial (20%) governments (Marchildon, 2013). In 2004, the federal government adopted a 10-year plan
to strengthen health care. The plan increased federal health transfers to the provinces
by 6%, and the provinces were supposed to place greater emphasis on reducing wait
times and improving quality (Allin, 2012). Some of these funds have been used to track
and reduce wait times. The federal government has also encouraged the use of health
technology assessment, clinical guidelines, and best practices to enhance patient safety.
Critics argue that despite the increase in attention to quality in individual provinces,
Canada lacks a “guiding framework that supports” quality improvement in primary care
(Sibbald, McPherson, &amp; Kothari, 2013, p. 2).
In China, the issue of quality is also central to recent policy debates, but their starting point is radically different. When the Chinese government reduced its subsidies
for health care in the late 1970s, health care organizations and providers often turned
to pharmaceutical companies to make up for these lost revenues. Rather than focus on
providing primary and preventive care, for example, many first-level hospitals focused
on selling drugs to patients (Wang et al., 2011). As a result, these institutions developed a reputation for poor quality, and patients now crowd into larger hospitals and
academic medical centers, creating overcrowding problems. Part of the motivation for
expanding health insurance in China is to improve the quality of care across the entire
health care system (Wang et al., 2011).
Criteria used to evaluate the performance of health care systems—such as access
to, cost of, and quality of health care—are often called the “three-legged stool” of
health policy. Until recently, however, quality did not receive a great deal of attention. Since the 1970s, researchers, policymakers, and patients have been demanding
better information about quality. In the late 1990s, the U.S. Institute of Medicine led
the world in calling attention to the importance of this issue, based on a report that
uncovered disturbing evidence of problems with safety and quality in the United States
(IOM, 1999). In contrast, the SARS epidemic embarrassed the Chinese government
and sparked efforts to improve access to and the quality of care. Finding solutions to
such problems has been a challenge because stakeholders cling to existing practices
and technologies, data limitations make it difficult to measure the quality of care, and
fundamental disagreements remain about the meaning of quality and how to measure
value for money in health care. ■ Lessons
Based on the experience of NHI and NHS systems in the countries we have examined,
we would highlight four lessons for policymakers in the United States:
■ ■ ■ ■ Achieving the goal of universal health coverage requires legislation to make such
coverage compulsory.
Financing broader insurance coverage in the United States—beyond Medicare and
Medicaid—requires increasing government subsidies based on ability-to-pay criteria.
Health care systems with universal coverage rely increasingly on economic evaluation of health technology as a criterion for making coverage decisions.
Containing health care costs has not been achieved without greater reliance than in
the United States on price regulation and systemwide budget targets.
Copyright Springer Publishing Company, LLC Chapter 4. Comparative Health Systems 71 The ACA represents the most significant health care reforms since Medicare and
Medicaid in 1965, because it is likely to increase significantly the share of the population with health insurance coverage and redistribute the burden of health care financing from those who are wealthier, younger, and healthier toward those who are poorer,
older, and sicker (see Chapter 3). We would argue that this legislation draws heavily
on the first two lessons of comparative experience (the mandate and the move toward
ability-to-pay criteria for financing health care), less so on the third (economic evaluation of health technology), and ignores the fourth (greater price regulation and budget
targets). This will bring the United States closer to other wealthy nations in terms of
population coverage. Yet the U.S. health care system continues to present some striking contrasts to most other wealthy nations. It remains a patchwork system characterized by a complex combination of institutions that include an enclave of socialized
medicine such as the VHA, a social insurance program (Medicare), and social welfare
programs (Medicaid and CHIP); tax-subsidized employer-based private insurance for
about one half of the population; and heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payment for the
population that remains uninsured, similar to the situation in China, India, and most
developing nations.
The United States has the highest per capita expenditures; the highest salaries for
physicians and other professionals making up the health care workforce; and the highest aggregate prices for hospitals, physicians’ services, and pharmaceuticals. Despite
our drive to innovate and invest in the latest medical technologies, access to hightechnology services, as well as to basic primary care services, is highly inequitable
compared with other OECD nations—but not with China, which faces not only the
usual inequities among populations of different income and educational levels, but
also massive inequities among its urban and rural residents, and, within cities, among
its registered and migrant populations.
Another way in which the U.S. health care system differs from that of wealthy
OECD nations concerns the vast range of health insurance products we offer to our
population, including the option (following the ACA) of not purchasing health insurance, albeit with a financial penalty. Despite the emphasis on choice of insurer many
people find themselves confined to obtaining health care within restricted provider
networks outside of which payment for services often becomes unaffordable. There
is no parallel to this problem in wealthy OECD nations such as England, Canada, and
France. In China, choice of too many insurance products is not the problem. The situation there is far worse than in the United States because a large part of the urban
migrant population is typically excluded from health insurance coverage. The problem of internal migrants in China is substantial, but not surprising, for a system that
spends only 3.2% of its GDP on health care and has only recently set itself the goal of
providing universal coverage. ■ Discussion Questions
