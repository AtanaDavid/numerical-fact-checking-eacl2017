A committee of interested golfers from around the state formed the Georgia State Golf Association in 1916 following the first Georgia Amateur Championship. According to early records, the primary purpose of founding the Association was to conduct a state amateur championship. A 14-year-old Atlantan named Bobby Jones captured that first Georgia Amateur at Capital City Club in Atlanta. The GSGA was incorporated in 1924 and was managed solely by volunteers over the next five decades. Among its milestones, the GSGA began supporting turfgrass research in 1959, rating courses in 1961, added the Junior Championship in 1966 and began administering the handicap system in 1972 before adding its first full-time staff director in 1973. The following decades saw extensive growth in members, volunteers, staff and services as the GSGA expanded its competitions program to include 18 statewide events and four interstate matches, computerized the handicap system, formalized the course rating program, established a charitable foundation, started publishing Golf Georgia magazine and began managing the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame.

William H. (Bill) Zimmerman was born in Augusta, Ga., on November 23, 1915.  In 1930, he won the first of his five Augusta City Championships.  When he was 19 years old, he won the 1935 Georgia Amateur.  In 1972 and ‘73, Zimmerman won the International Seniors Championship at Gleneagles in Scotland, and was runner-up in 1974.  He was the first Georgian to ever win this tournament.  In 1980, at the age of 64, he won the U.S. Seniors Golf Association Tournament and again was the first Georgian to win this prestigious event.  He was a member of the board of governors at Augusta National Golf Club for 15 years, a member of the board of governors of both the American Seniors and the U.S. Senior Golf Association, and served a term as president of the GSGA (1956-57) and the Country Club of Columbus.
P.  Dan Yates, Jr., father of Danny, is a native of Atlanta, Ga., and born in 1918.  He grew up on the golf course at East Lake Country Club, tagging along with his older brother, Charles, and the great Bobby Jones.  From 1938-41, Yates was a member of the Georgia Tech golf team, serving as captain for three years.  Some of his amateur golf victories include the 1939 Georgia Amateur, the Dogwood Invitational, the Atlanta City Championship, and the Durham, N.C. Invitational.  In 1946, he was runner-up in the Georgia Amateur, and in 1941 and ‘46, he was runner-up in the Southern Golf Association Four-Ball.  Yates continues to contribute to the world of golf through association.  He served as a director of both the Georgia State Golf Association and Georgia State Golf Foundation.
Danny Yates was born in Atlanta, Ga., on May 3, 1950.  He is the son of P. Dan Yates, Jr., and nephew of Charlie Yates, both Hall of Famers themselves.  He won the 1970 Spirit of America and played on the 1971 and ‘72 Georgia SEC Championship Teams.  In 1971, Yates made the cut at the U.S. Open.  He has won the Southern Amateur, the 1992 U.S. Mid-Amateur, and pocketed both the Georgia Amateur and Georgia Mid-Amateur titles three times each.  He was runner-up in the 1974 North-South and runner-up in the 1988 U.S. Amateur.  He was a member of the 1988 U.S. World Amateur team, the 1989 and ‘93 Walker Cup Teams, and captained the 1999 and 2001 Walker Cup Teams.  Because of his amateur accomplishments, he played in the 1989 and ‘93 Masters Tournaments.  Yates served as a director of the GSGA for seven years, as a director for the Atlanta Junior Golf Association for 10 years, and a member of the USGA Junior Golf Committee for 12 years. He currently serves on the USGA Green Section Committee.
Charlie Yates was born in Atlanta, Ga., on September 9, 1913.  Boys High School of Atlanta, once the home of the South’s finest athletic talent, probably never produced a finer golfer than Yates.  During the 1930s, few golfing amateurs in the country were better known or more widely celebrated.  Yates won the Georgia Amateur in 1931 and ‘32.  In 1934, he won the NCAA individual title.  The following year, he won the Western Amateur.  This Georgia Tech star became an international name in golf in 1938 when he won the coveted British Amateur.  In 1936 and ‘38, he played on the U.S. Walker Cup team.  In 1953, he served as captain of the Walker Cup team, and was named honorary captain in 1985.  Five times in his competitive career, Yates, secretary of the Augusta National Golf Club, was the low scoring amateur in the Masters Tournament.  In 1980, Yates was presented with the Bob Jones Award by the United States Golf Association.  He was inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame on January 14, 1989, and inducted into the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame on February 6, 2015. Yates passed away October 17, 2005, at the age of 92.
Gregg Wolff was born in Philadelphia, Pa., on January 6, 1953.  While attending Georgia Southern, Gregg was a member of the nationally ranked men’s golf team and received the NCAA Independent All-American honor in 1976.  In 1978, he won his first professional golf tournament, the Mary Calder Invitational in Savannah.  He went on to win this tournament six more times.  Wolff joins fellow Hall of Fame member Dewitt Weaver Jr., in being the only players to have captured all four of the Georgia PGA major championships: the 1984, 2003 Match Play; 1990 Atlanta Open; the 1991 Georgia  Open; and the 1985, ‘87 and ‘88 Georgia PGA Championship.  As a senior, Wolff qualified for the 2004 U.S.  Senior Open, won the 2005 Georgia PGA Senior Club Professional Championship.  Other professional highlights include winning the Georgia PGA Player of the Year award an unprecedented seven times, receiving the 1996 Georgia PGA Junior Golf Leader Award, and being honored as the Georgia Professional of the Year in 1998.  In 2001, the Georgia PGA established an award in his honor, the Gregg Wolff Award, which will forever be awarded to the Georgia PGA member having the lowest stroke average each season.  Wolff has been head golf professional at Willow Lake Golf Club in Metter since 1981.
Billie Wickliffe was an outstanding golfer and a great contributor to the game in Georgia, a leader who had a long-range positive impact on women’s golf in our state, and for these virtues she is named to the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame.
The Georgia Women’s Golf Association record book shows that Wickliffe won its “official” state championship three times, in 1966 and 1967 at Match Play and 1971 at stroke play. She also won a second tournament that was conducted during many of those years, a “medal play” tournament in 1964 and 1970, and while those where not considered the official “championship,” the fields were reportedly just as strong and the players were trying just as hard to win. So, she won a statewide competition among the best women golfers in the state five times.
But while her golf was among the best in her day, she was clearly instrumental in taking the GWGA to newer and more fertile ground and gave up her championship play to do so. From 1976 to 1987, she led an organized effort that would form a new organization, GALGA, that allowed all women golfers to play in a statewide competition. Upon the GWGA’s change of membership criteria, she encouraged GALGA to disband since all players could then play in GWGA events.
Wickliffe was a past president of both GWGA and GALGA at different times. She also served as a course rater for the Northeast section for the GSGA. In 1994, GWGA accorded her its highest honor, honorary life membership, and posthumously renamed the Medalist Trophy, given during its championship to the player with the lowest qualifying score after 36 holes, as the Billie Wickliffe Memorial Trophy.
DeWitt Thompson Weaver, Jr., was born in Danville, Ky., on September 14, 1939.  In high school and college at Southern Methodist University, Weaver excelled in a number of sports.  He moved to Georgia after college and since 1965 has been a dominant force in the state, winning a record seven Georgia PGA Championships, a record four Georgia Opens and the Georgia PGA Match Play Championship.  While competing on the PGA TOUR from 1967-76, he won the 1971 PGA Match Play Championship and the 1972 Southern Open. Weaver was the longest driver on the TOUR in 1969.  His Champions Tour career was highlighted by the 1991 Bank One Championship.  He was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Northeast Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.  He believes strongly in the scripture verse, Ps. 37:4, marked on his ball for identification.
American golf lost one of its best friends when Fielding Wallace of Augusta, Ga., died in 1954.  For more than 50 years, Wallace had been a leader in the game.  He was involved in the organization of the GSGA in 1924 and served as its president from 1936-45.  He also served as president of the USGA in 1948-49.  Wallace was a founding member of Augusta National Golf Club and served as secretary until his death.  He was also president of Augusta Country Club from 1921-35.  Wallace was a gentleman who exemplified the old maxim that “the first quality of a gentleman is gentleness.”
Albert J. “Duck” Swann’s golf career spanned from his college days at Georgia Tech to an international senior championship in his later years, and he was a dedicated servant of the game of golf and of charitable causes in his community. The Georgia Golf Hall of Fame is proud to include him posthumously in the Class of 2013 with his family and many of his friends and colleagues to honor his induction.
Duck Swann was a major influence on the lives of many in the Macon community and at Idle Hour Club. Peter Persons, Georgia Golf Hall of Fame Class of 2011, recalls how Swann would be one of his first calls when he returned home from a PGA TOUR event and repaired clubs for him at his home workshop. “He’d console me and inspire me,” said Persons. “He was one of my best friends, though he was of my father’s generation.”
Swann became acquainted with Roger Kaiser, the legendary Georgia Tech basketball All-American player and national championship coach at West Georgia and Life College, not through golf or a “Tech connection,” but at a chance meeting at a sports camp. “Duck brought a busload of youngsters up from Macon to my sports camp in north Georgia,” said Kaiser. “I didn’t know who he was then, but over time our families became very close friends.”
A Maconite throughout his life, Swann played on the Lanier High golf team and won the 1941 Macon City and 1942 Georgia Interscholastic titles. Following World War II years as an Air Force pilot, he was the Southeastern Conference champion in 1948 at Georgia Tech and was captain of the Yellow Jackets’ 1949 SEC title team.
He spent two more combat flying years in Korea before settling into several businesses in the Macon area. In 1958 he was elected to Georgia Tech’s “all time” golf team and into the Georgia Tech Athletic Hall of Fame in 1964.
Swann’s golf career blossomed again upon the time he turned senior amateur age of 55 in 1980. The year 1983 was his biggest. His most significant victory came at Walton Heath in England, as he became the first American to capture the British Senior Open Amateur. Also during the year, he won the Georgia Seniors title and qualified for the match play portion of the USGA Senior Amateur Championship.
The following year, he won the Legendary Senior Amateur in Birmingham, and was runner-up at the American and Georgia seniors. In 1987, he won the Western Seniors.
Swann was a member of several golf organizations throughout his life, including the Peach Blossom Classic, American Senior Golf Association, state Walter Hagen cancer tournament committee, Middle Georgia Golf Championship Board and was a past president of Idle Hour Club.
He also spent many hours volunteering his time for civic and charitable causes in the Macon and central Georgia area. He was a chairman or president of the Bibb County Department of Family and Children Services, Macon Rotary Club, Lanier Booster Club, Middle Georgia Area Georgia Tech Club, Tech-Georgia Development Fund, Vine-Ingle Little League and Macon YMCA.
Swann passed away in 2007 at the age of 81. He is survived by his wife, Martha, sons Albert III and Brad, daughter Kate Swann Ivey, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
Louise Suggs was born in Atlanta, Ga., on September 7, 1923. During her brilliant amateur career, she won the Georgia Women’s Amateur Championship twice, the Southern Amateur twice, the North-South Championship three times, the Western Amateur twice, the Western Open twice, the 1946 Titleholders, and the 1948 British Open.  She was also a member of the Curtis Cup team in 1948.
After turning professional in 1948, Suggs became a founding member of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA).  As a pro she won the Western Open again in 1948 and ‘53, and repeated her Titleholders win in 1954, ‘56 and ‘59.  Suggs won the U.S. Women’s Open in 1949 and ‘52, and was earned entry into the LPGA Hall of Fame.  She won the LPGA Championship in 1957.
During her professional career, she won 50 LPGA events and served as president of the LPGA in 1956-57.  The USGA honored Suggs in 2007 with the Association’s Bob Jones Award.  The LPGA has named its Rookie of the Year Award after her. Suggs passed away in August of 2015.
Eileen Stulb was born June 23, 1923, in Augusta, Ga.  Stulb was the first female to earn a spot on the Augusta College golf team.  She was runner-up in the Titleholders Championship twice, considered for many years to be the equivalent of the men’s Masters Tournament.  In the Women’s Western Amateur, she was a quarterfinalist on two occasions.  Stulb won the Georgia Women’s Amateur twice.  She played in the U.S. Women’s Amateur seven times, the U.S. Women’s Open and the USGA Senior Women's Amateur.  Stulb served on the Board of Directors for the Georgia Women’s Golf Association, the Women’s Eastern Association, the Titleholders Association, the USGA Senior Women’s Committee and was the local chairwoman for the 1971 U.S. Girls’ Junior Championship held at the Augusta Country Club.  Stulb passed away on February 26, 2007, at the age of 83.
Jim Stuart compiled one of the most enviable of championship title collections in mid-amateur, college and junior competitions and it is these accomplishments that have earned him a place in the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame.
None are more notable than consecutive U.S. Mid-Amateur championships, in 1990 at Troon Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona and in 1991 at Long Cove Club in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Stuart is part of a select club of Georgians, including Bobby Jones, Alexa Stirling Fraser, Allen Doyle and Hollis Stacy, who have won consecutive USGA national championship titles.
Those two victories earned him invitations to participate in the following years’ Masters Tournaments. He missed the 36-hole cut both years but scored even-par 72 in the second round of the 1991 tournament, second low of the day among amateurs.
Before coming to Georgia to go to college, he had an outstanding junior record in Minnesota, winning the state’s PGA Junior title three times and playing in the Junior Orange Bowl International, the first PGA National Junior and twice played in the Junior World in San Diego, finishing sixth in 1977.
During two years at junior college power Alexander City (now Central Alabama), he earned All-American honors and won the 1978 national junior college individual title and was third in 1979. Stuart then came to Georgia to Columbus College (now Columbus State University), where he was part of the NCAA Division II national championship team in 1980 and was named a Division II All-American.
His string of tournament wins in GSGA state events began at about the same time as his national victories. He led his River North Golf Club (now Healy Point) to the GSGA State Team title in 1991, teamed with Bill Roberts to win the 1992 Four-Ball championship, was runner-up in the 1994 Georgia Amateur to Carter Mize and won the 1995 Georgia Mid-Amateur championship.
Stuart was also named the GSGA Player of the Year in 1994 and played on four Southeastern Challenge Cup teams and four Billy Peters Cup Match teams. He has also won several other events around the state, including the 1998 Peach Blossom invitational in his home town of Macon and the City of Macon championship six times.
Born in Savannah, Ga., on March 16, 1954, Hollis Stacy set impressive records that still stand today.  In 1969, at the age of 15, she became the youngest player to win the U.S. Girls’ Junior Championship.  She is also one of only two players to win that title three times.  She won the 1970 North-South Amateur and was a member of the 1972 Curtis Cup Team.  Stacy joined the LPGA Tour in 1974, and her 17 victories include three U.S.  Women’s Opens.  Stacy posted back-to-back wins in the 1977 and ‘78 U.S. Women’s Opens, the 1981 and ‘82 West Virginia Classic, and the 1982 and ‘83 S&H Golf Classic.  After recuperating from a serious car accident mid-season in 1988, Stacy returned to score four top-five finishes and continued playing professional golf into the early 2000s, scoring a win on the Women’s Senior Golf Tour in 2001. In 2012, she was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.
A native of Savannah, Ga., Johnny Skeadas did not play golf until he was 21 years old.  As a teenager, he excelled at another sport: rifle marksmanship.  Beginning at the age of 13, he won numerous shooting medals, captained the University of Georgia rifle team and tied a world record.  He was inducted into the National Rifle Association Hall of Fame and his 1973 induction into the Savannah Athletic Hall of Fame was based not on golf, but on his achievements as one of the country’s finest marksmen.  In 1952, he brought this extraordinary hand-eye coordination to golf, thus beginning another story of excellence in sports.  In 1959, Skeadas won the first of six Savannah City Amateur Golf Championships.  In the years to come, Skeadas distinguished himself as a top senior golfer by winning the Georgia Senior Championship twice, reaching the final 16 in the 1988 USGA Senior Amateur and finishing in the top 10 in the 1990 British Senior Amateur.  He was named GSGA Senior Player of the Year three times.  He passed away in 1996 at the age of 64.  In 1998, the GSGA named the Senior Championship trophy in Skeadas’ honor.
Born May 6, 1956, in Atlanta, Ga., Tim Simpson attended high school at Woodward Academy where he was the Atlanta Junior Champion, Georgia Junior Champion and Westlake National Junior Champion.  He then went to the University of Georgia on a full scholarship, collecting several tournament titles and conference and national honors in his first two years.  After turning professional at age 20, Simpson was one of the youngest players to earn his tour card at 21 years and 2 months of age. Simpson’s first professional win was the 1982 Cacheral World Championship.  In 1985, he was bestowed with a PGA Tour Achievement Award and was the Southern Open Champion.  He captured the New Orleans Championship, the Walt Disney Classic Championship and earned the PGA TOUR’s Comeback Player of the Year Award in 1989, when he also became the fourth player in history to earn over $1 million in worldwide earnings.  In addition, he set the lowest 54-hole total in PGA TOUR history at 23-under-par.  Again in 1990, he won the Walt Disney Championship, became the first player in U.S.  Open history to ever reach 9-under-par and was a member of the U.S.  Team in the Asahi Four Tour World Championship, all earning him the Georgia Professional Athlete of the Year award.  A three time Georgia Open Champion, Simpson has 66 top 10 finishes in his PGA TOUR career, although that career was derailed by severe medical problems.  After surviving many medical procedures, including brain surgery, he returned to competition on the Champions Tour in 2006, earning the PGA’s Comeback Player of the Year award that same year.
Gene Sauers was a successful junior and college golfer in Georgia who was a three-time winner on the PGA TOUR spanning parts of three decades.
Sauers was born in 1962 in Savannah and attended Benedictine and Johnson High Schools. As a junior, he was runner-up to Georgia Golf Hall of Famer Peter Persons in the 1980 Georgia Junior Championship and was a member of the Georgia team that included Persons, Davis Love III and Hugh Royer III in that year’s Georgia-South Carolina-Florida Junior Challenge Match.
Sauers went on to attend Alexander City (Ala.) Junior College for two years, where he finished third and fourth in the junior college national championships. He graduated from Georgia Southern University, where he won the TAAC conference title.
Sauers was the youngest person to earn a PGA TOUR card out of the 1984 Qualifying School and soon after won his first of three TOUR titles, the 1986 Bank of Boston Classic. He also won the 1989 Hawaiian Open and 2002 Air Canada Championship. After having the outright lead after 54 holes of the 1992 PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis, he finished tied for second, three strokes back of Nick Price.
In 1988, Sauers became the first PGA TOUR player to win a Nationwide Tour event, the South Carolina Classic, following a victory on the PGA TOUR. He also won the unofficial 1990 Deposit Guaranty Classic and pocketed two other second-place finishes. Sauers posted seven seasons on the PGA TOUR in which he finished 42nd or better on the money list, but his 2002 victory earned him more money ($630,000) than in any single previous season.
Sauers, who still resides in Savannah, continues to play in some PGA TOUR and Nationwide events in preparation for the Champions Tour, for which he will be eligible in late August 2012.

Oscar Bane “Pop” Keeler was born on June 4, 1882, and spent most of his boyhood in Marietta, Ga.  He was one of those wonderful characters of old-time newspapering who have become all too scarce in present-day journalism.  He was a veteran Atlanta Journal sports staffer, covering more than 80 major golf tournaments of national and international importance.  He won national recognition and fame as a writer and authority on golf.  But, most importantly to the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame,  Keeler chronicled every tournament stroke ever played by the legendary Bobby Jones.  He saw Bobby Jones – just 14 years old – win his first big tournament, the Georgia Amateur in 1916.  Soon after, the two became close companions.  He traveled 150,000 miles with Jones and is the only man to witness all of Jones’ 13 major championship wins – most notably the grand slam victories of 1930.  A unique individual, he was one of the best-known and liked of all the newspapermen in the business.  Keeler passed away on October 15, 1950, at the age of 68.

Suzanne Jackson could be called one of Georgia golf’s modern pioneers.

Born in 1952 in LaGrange, Ga., Jackson was the only girl playing on the boys’ golf team at LaGrange High from 1968-70. As a junior golfer, she advanced to the semifinals of the 1969 U.S. Girls’ Junior Championship and won the Burdeshaw Trophy as low junior medalist in the 1970 Georgia Women’s Amateur.

Alfred F. “Tup” Holmes was an outstanding amateur golfer who made an immeasurable impact on the game by virtue of his leadership in the opening of Atlanta’s golf courses to black citizens, which became an important step for equality in the sport.
He was born November 6, 1917 in East Point, Ga., graduated from Booker T. Washington High in Atlanta in 1933 and earned a degree from Tuskegee (Ala.) Institute in 1939.
Holmes excelled as a young amateur golfer. In college, he won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference three times. He also captured the black-only Southern Amateur title three times and was the National Negro Amateur Champion four times.
After having been denied the opportunity to play a round at Bobby Jones Golf Course in 1951, Holmes and his family were instrumental in obtaining the right for blacks to play golf on City of Atlanta public golf courses. They subsequently brought suit against the city and the case wound its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, whose final ruling would end segregation of the City’s courses and eventually lead to the desegregation of all City of Atlanta public places.
The first ruling in the case, in Federal District Court in Atlanta, was that blacks could play on city public courses but only on certain days. The family appealed the verdict and a federal appellate court upheld the district court’s decision. Holmes obtained assistance from Thurgood Marshall, then a Baltimore attorney who successfully argued the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, in the family’s next appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. It struck down the original ruling by the district court, sending the case back to the original judge with instructions to end segregation on the City’s courses.
On December 23, 1955, “Tup” Holmes, his brother, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and friends Charles T. Bell, T.D. Hawkins and E.J. Peterson played a round of golf at North Fulton Golf Course, thus legally breaking the color barrier on Atlanta’s public golf courses.
Holmes passed away from cancer December 16, 1967, but his family and the City of Atlanta joined together to dedicate a golf course in his honor in 1983 -- the Alfred “Tup” Holmes Memorial Golf Course in Adams Park on the site of a Civil War battlefield.
Holmes was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame and among family and friends in attendance at the ceremony was 91-year-old Charles Bell, a member of the 1955 ground-breaking fivesome.
