The end of the season smiled on Clement Desalle who took victory at both Bastogne, Belgium on 18 August and in Matterley in the UK a week later. In front of his fans, the Rockstar Energy Suzuki rider, who receives technical support from Motul, was classified second and first in the two races, finishing on the podium for the 12th time this season and winning brilliantly in the second race ahead of Antonio Cairoli, the championship leader.
For the Rockstar Energy Suzuki team, the Belgian race was also the scene for another event: the first podium for young Brian Hsu in the EMX125 category. The 15-year-old rider finished second aboard his RM125, remaining in the lead pack and successfully finishing ahead of Nicolas Dercourt.
In England, the conditions were made more difficult by the rain that had fallen in the morning, but didn’t discourage 25,000 spectators from attending. Desalle was second in the first race, just behind Cairoli, but won the second, the combination of which placed him in the lead. Following this event,  Cairoli’s championship victory was confirmed, as was second place to Desalle. "I'm really happy with my fourth win of the season," confirmed the Belgian driver. "In the first race, I was a little nervous but I had a good start in the second. (...) I'm really happy to have won here in England, as we’ve had three years without a podium up to now. "
Behind Desalle, teammate Kevin Strijbos showed himself also to be in top form by winning second place in England, allowing him to get closer to Paulin in the standings.
