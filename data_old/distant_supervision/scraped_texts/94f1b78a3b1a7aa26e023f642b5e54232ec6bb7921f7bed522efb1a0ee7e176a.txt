We specialise in Slow holidays, that is to say, holidays which reveal the lesser-taken path and which offer a truly individual holiday experience.
Whether you choose to walk, ski, cycle, or take an inspiring journey by train, boat or car, Inntravel’s carefully crafted self-guided activity holidays ease you into the rhythm and patterns of everyday life as you journey through wonderful landscapes, uncover hidden corners and share authentic encounters with local people along the way. They give you time to relish delicious regional cuisine and relax in family-run hotels and character inns, where you receive the warmest of welcomes. Savour the moments and enjoy the Slow life – with Inntravel.
