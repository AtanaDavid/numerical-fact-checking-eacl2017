Note: WSL will install Ubuntu version 16.04 (Xenial) instead of Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) in an upcoming release.  This change will apply to Insiders installing new instances (lxrun.exe /install or first run of bash.exe).  Existing instances with Trusty will not be upgraded automatically. Users can upgrade their Trusty image to Xenial using the do-release-upgrade command.
WSL is experiencing an issue with some socket implementations.  The bugcheck manifests itself as a crash with the error “ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXECUTE MEMORY”.  The most common manifestation of this issue is a crash when using ssh.  The root cause is fixed on internal builds and will be pushed to Insiders at the earliest opportunity.
