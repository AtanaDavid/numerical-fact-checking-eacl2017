Do not buy from here. Even if you are a recognizable regular they will not offer you any sort of refund for a faulty item. I've been shopping here since they opened & after thousands of dollars spent in their shop they cannot offer me $90 to replace a piece I had less than 24 hours, receipt on hand. The manager will not face you either. Not how you run a successful business.
