Nyle DiMarco made history by winning season 22 of “Dancing with the Stars” on March 24, 2016. The model is the first deaf contestant to win the prize, and he’s the first winner since Donald Driver in season 14 to win the title without getting the highest score in the finals.
DiMarco and Driver were both partnered with Peta Murgatroyd, who is now a two-time winner and the sixth pro dancer to win multiple seasons of the show, but she’s still got a long way to go if she wants to catch all-time record-holder Derek Hough with six wins.
