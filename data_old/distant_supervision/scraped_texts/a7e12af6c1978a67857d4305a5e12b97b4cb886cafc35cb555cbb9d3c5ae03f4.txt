We are the extreme cleaning company that goes beyond the everyday to tackle cleaning problems that non-specialists just can’t cope with. From hotels to prisons, crime scenes to cruise ships, public spaces to private hospitals, we do what others can’t do – going beyond cleaning.
Using our services is a guarantee of a job well done and quickly executed. It safeguards your organisation’s reputation, bringing peace of mind that comes from knowing the health and well-being of your staff, clients and their customers are in safe hands.
Find out about how we can help you tackle the cleaning problems that need specialist knowledge and expertise. We work directly with clients and also as sub contractors for facilities management organisations who just don’t have our skill sets in house.
