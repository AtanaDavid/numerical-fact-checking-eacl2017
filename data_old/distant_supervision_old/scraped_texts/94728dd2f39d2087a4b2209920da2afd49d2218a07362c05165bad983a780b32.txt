We have been reporting for over a month about the coming realignment in professional indoor soccer. After the Professional Arena Soccer League and Major Indoor Soccer League championship games yesterday, we expected no news until early April.
That changed this morning when the MISL headquarters released the following statement:
Since acquiring the MISL in 2011, we have been committed to raising the overall standards within the league and bringing increased stability to what had previously been a turbulent period for the indoor professional game.
