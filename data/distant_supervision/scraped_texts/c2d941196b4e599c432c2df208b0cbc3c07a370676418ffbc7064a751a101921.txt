Human rights body, Amnesty International is calling on local leaders to condemn the spate of racist attacks and incidents in the wake of the 23 June pro—Brexit vote.
In an on line statement, Amnesty says:
“Violence. Vandalism. Hate speech. Racist slogans on t-shirts. In the last few days, reports of hate crimes in Britain have increased. Fuelled by years of hostile rhetoric, coupled with divisive campaigns, we are now seeing racism and xenophobia on the rise on our streets and in our communities.
“Local leaders must condemn these actions immediately and do everything in their power to make people safe and welcome. Tell your council to speak out against racism, xenophobia and hate crimes now.”
