In general, payees of interest from a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation are entitled to reduced rates of, or
exemption from, tax under a treaty in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as if they had received the interest
from a domestic corporation. However, a foreign corporation that receives interest paid by a U.S. trade or business of a foreign
corporation also must be a qualified resident of its country of residence to be entitled to benefits under that country's
tax treaty. If the payee foreign corporation is a resident of a country that has entered into an income tax treaty since 1987
that contains a limitation on benefits article, the foreign corporation need only satisfy the limitation on benefits article
in that treaty to qualify for a reduced rate of tax.
Alternatively, a payee may be entitled to treaty benefits under the payer's treaty if there is a provision in that treaty
that applies specifically to interest paid by the payer foreign corporation. This provision may exempt all or a part of this
interest. Some treaties provide for an exemption regardless of the payee's residence or citizenship, while others provide
for an exemption according to the payee's status as a resident or citizen of the payer's country.
A foreign corporation that pays interest must be a qualified resident (under section 884 of the Internal Revenue Code) of
its country of residence for the payer's treaty to exempt payments from tax by the foreign corporation. However, if the foreign
corporation is a resident of a country that has entered into an income tax treaty since 1987 that contains a limitation on
benefits article, the foreign corporation need only satisfy the limitation on benefits article in that treaty to qualify for
the exemption.
