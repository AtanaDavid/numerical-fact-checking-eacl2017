Offit said the measles vaccine is "so effective that you can eliminate the disease as we did by 2000. But it's a highly contagious disease, so if you get any sort of erosion in herd immunity, the disease comes back," he said.
While measles is not particularly fatal for healthy children, it can cause severe complications among those with weakened immune systems, Majumder said.
"Unfortunately, these children are often ineligible for the vaccine and thus must rely on the immunity of their neighbors, friends and peers to stay safe. So, if you can get vaccinated, do get vaccinated -- herd immunity depends on it," she said.
Offit thinks that the Disney outbreak may be a tipping point in public opinion on the issue.
"I have never seen so much anger towards parents who are choosing not to vaccinate," he said. "There was something about the Disney outbreak that really upset people."
According to a recent HealthDay/Harris Poll, 87 percent of more than 2,000 adults surveyed said they thought that the vaccines routinely given to young children are safe. That's up from 77 percent found in a similar poll last July.
Dr. Vincenzo Maniaci, an attending emergency physician at Miami Children's Hospital, said despite the renewed interest in vaccinations, under-vaccination remains a major public health problem.
"Vaccination rates in some areas of the country have gotten so low that it's concerning," he said. "There are going to be more major outbreaks. It's just a matter of time."
