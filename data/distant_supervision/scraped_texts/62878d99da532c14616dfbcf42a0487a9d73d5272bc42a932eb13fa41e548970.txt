I imagine Theresa May was in the top sets of the grammar school she believes made her the woman she is today; I wonder what the fate of those in lower sets has been and how they reflect on their schooldays?
If grammar schools can join independent schools in being the engines of social mobility, then that’s something to look forward to, but there is a need for research to establish whether the emotional belief in their social benefit can be proven.
If the creation of new grammar schools counters the postcode lottery of state education, then this too can only be a good thing.
Two cheers for Theresa May and the putting of grammar schools back on the educational and political agenda. But the real work starts now.
Britain needs to ensure access to a good education for all its young people and the return of the sort of social mobility that characterised the “white hot” 1960s.  Only then will we have leaders of the calibre we will need to navigate what it means to be proudly British in a post-Brexit Europe and to play their part in promoting the global knowledge economy in which the poorly educated (individuals and nations) will be left further and further behind.
