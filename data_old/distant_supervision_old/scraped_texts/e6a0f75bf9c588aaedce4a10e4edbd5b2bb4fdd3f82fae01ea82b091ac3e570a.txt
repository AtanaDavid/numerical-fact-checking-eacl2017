Frenchman Leads Rockstar Energy Husqvarna During EnduroGP Final
September 11, 2016 – (Motor Sports Newswire) – Mathias Bellino has secured the runner-up position in the final EnduroGP World Championship standings following two strong performances at his home round of the series held in Cahors, France. Riding his FE 450 to the top of the overall and Enduro 2 class results on day one, Bellino finished fifth overall on day two to claim second in the EnduroGP championship.
Making the best possible start to the event the Frenchman topped the Friday night Super Test in spectacular style, entertaining his home fans with his all-out riding style. Keeping the momentum rolling into the first full day of competition he was faster in four of the opening five special tests to position himself at the top of the results. Remaining out front he won the day by four seconds. On day two a big crash in the Extreme Test prevented Mathias from challenging for the podium.
Despite stalling his bike and losing valuable time early on day one Danny McCanney bounced back from a seventh place result to finish as runner-up in the Enduro 1 class on day two. Just 28 seconds behind eventual winner Nathan Watson, Danny finished ahead of Finn Eero Remes to bring his 2016 Enduro World Championship campaign to a highly positive close. Pascal Rauchenecker also enjoyed a strong end to his first full season of enduro racing. Sixth in E1 on day one he then placed fourth and just 11 seconds from the podium on day two.
For Husqvarna’s youngest team member Josep Garcia the final round of the 2016 Enduro World Championship ended with the Spaniard coming agonisingly close to winning on day one, before topping the Enduro Junior class on day two. Denied the top step of the podium on day one by just over one-second, on the final day of the series Josep secured a well-deserved win by placing six seconds ahead of Enduro Junior World Champion Giacomo Redondi.
In the Women’s class Husqvarna supported rider Jane Daniels placed third on both days to finish third in the final Enduro Women’s World Championship standings.
Mathias Bellino: “It was a great GP and it feels good to finish the season like this. After my win in the Super Test I had a great start to day one topping the overall in the first two tests. I earned myself a bit of a gap to the rest of the field and spent the rest of the day trying to make sure I stayed on top. To get the overall win in front of my home crowd felt amazing. I wanted to try my best to get the overall win again on day two. My speed wasn’t bad throughout the day and I was running second until the last lap. Unfortunately, I had a big crash in the extreme test and lost any chance to get the win. After that I remained calm and tried to do my best for a good finish. I’m really happy to end the season as a runner-up in the Enduro 2 and the overall EnduroGP class standings.”
Danny McCanney: “It was a good GP for me. Saturday didn’t start that well as I was a bit too slow in the first enduro test and then straight away in the next cross test I stalled the bike and lost a lot of time. I lost about 20 seconds there and that really made the difference between the podium and my seventh position. After that I started feeling better on the bike. I started off strong in all three first tests on day two. I knew that was going to help me during the day and I kept pushing hard trying to also stay consistent in my times. Except for one crash during the day I couldn’t say I made any other big mistakes. Everything was good and I’m really happy to end the season with a second place. I started this season knowing I wasn’t 100% prepared for it following my knee surgery. I knew I was going to get better throughout the season and that’s exactly what happened.”
Pascal Rauchenecker: “I’m happy to end my first season in enduro with a sixth and a fourth result. Overall, it’s been a learning year for me and I feel I’ve made some huge improvement in my riding. I did make a few mistakes this year, but I’ve learned from every single one of them. We also have a very good bike and a solid foundation to keep improving my results for the coming season. I’ll continue working as hard as always and I hope as soon as the next season starts I’ll be able to fight for the top in my class.”
Josep Garcia: “Winning the Enduro Junior class on the final day of the championship is a fantastic end to the season. The conditions were perfect for me this weekend, which is why I was disappointed that I didn’t win on day one. I was so close to getting the win, but finishing first on day two makes up for that. It was great battling with Redondi and to win feels so good. It’s been a great season and I have to say a huge thanks to the Husqvarna team.”
