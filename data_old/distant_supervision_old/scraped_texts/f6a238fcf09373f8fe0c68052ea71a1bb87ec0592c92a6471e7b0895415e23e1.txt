The Chunichi Crowns Open is part of the Japan Golf Tour and was won by Seve Ballesteros in 1991 with 275 strokes (5 under par). The 1 to 9 irons as well as the pitching wedge and sand wedge used there by him have been forged into 50 watch cases for the exclusive «Seve Ballesteros» limited series. The processing method chosen with the melting of the golf clubs, casting in a mold and subsequent forging of the case makes it possible to tell which watch case comes from which of Seve’s irons. So if you golf with a «Seve Ballesteros» by Jaermann & Stübi, you’ll always make your stroke with an iron from Seve. And if the ball sometimes doesn’t land on the fairway, just remember the unforgettable shots Seve made with this iron.
