We may not be in favor of abortion, we may be unwilling to
consider it a choice we would make, but we are equally unwilling to
impose our choice on others.
I hear this all the time and it remains the dumbest opinion
possible on the subject.
If abortion is simply the discarding of a cluster of cells
lacking the most basic precepts of humanity, then there is no
reason to "not be in favor of abortion." If you would not do so
personally because of some belief that the developing fetus may
indeed be distinctly human, then allowing its murder is a violation
of NAP.
