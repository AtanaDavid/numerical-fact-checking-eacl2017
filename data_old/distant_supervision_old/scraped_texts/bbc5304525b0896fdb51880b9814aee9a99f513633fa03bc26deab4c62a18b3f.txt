The life of a local sports legend will play out in a short documentary film premiering tonight in Dayton.
In the 1970â€™s, Dwight Anderson was nicknamed "The Blur" because of his speed on the basketball court. As a sophomore, he led Roth High School to a state championship title in 1975 and as a senior in 1978 was named top high school player in the country.
Anderson went to play for the universities of Kentucky and Southern California and was a second round NBA draft pick for the Washington Bullets in 1982.
