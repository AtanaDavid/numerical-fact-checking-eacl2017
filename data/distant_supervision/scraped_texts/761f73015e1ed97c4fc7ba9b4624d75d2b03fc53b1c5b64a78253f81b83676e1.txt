The son of Hamas founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef revealed to CNN that Hamas’s “final destination” goes beyond just the destruction of Israel.
“Hamas is not seeking coexistence and compromise; Hamas is seeking conquest and taking over,” said Mosab Hassan Yousef, who has rejected Hamas’s objectives and converted to Christianity. Ultimately, Hamas aims to help create an Islamic caliphate “on the rubble of any other civilization.”
“Hamas does not care about the lives of Palestinians, does not care about the lives of Israelis or Americans,” he continued. “How can you continue in that society?”
Yousef, who was meant to be the heir to his father’s leadership role in Hamas, said Palestinian children as young as five years old are taught to be willing to take their own lives to achieve Hamas’s goals, as he was taught at a young age. “When I look at the children of Gaza, and I know what they are fed, I know that they have no choice,” he said.
Yousef spent a decade as an informant for the Israeli military before seeking political asylum in the United States.
“It is impossible, almost, for anybody to break through and see the truth and real face of Hamas, and be able to leave at some point,” he said. “As you see in my case, I had to lose everything just to say no to Hamas.”
