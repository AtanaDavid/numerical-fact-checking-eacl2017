Jack White, the golf professional at Sunningdale Golf Club near London, was the winner of the 1904 British Open.
White is virtually unknown today, but his win here probably wasn't a surprise to the other golfers and fans of the time. White finished in the Top 6 in five of the previous six British Opens played, including a runner-up showing in 1899. The 1899 and 1904 British Opens were played on the same course, Royal St. George's, so that links was clearly to White's liking.
Several scoring records were set at the 1904 British Open:
In addition to those scoring achievements, White was the first winner in tournament history to shoot a lower score in each successive round - he went 80, 75, 72 and 69.

The format of the tournament also changed this year. For the first time, the British Open was played over three days: 18 holes each the first two days, then 36 holes the final day.
Brothers Tom and Harry Vardon finished fourth and fifth, respectively - one of only a few times Tom beat Harry in an Open.
Of the three record-setting scorers, White was the first to finish. Using a putter that was so short "that his hands were virtually level with his knees," according to the R&A, White came in with his 69 to post 296.
Braid had a long putt on the final hole to win, but didn't realize it: He thought he could win with a 2-putt, and so lagged his first putt up close. That mistake meant he finished on 297.
That left Taylor on the course with the only chance to catch White, but he needed to shoot 67 to tie and force a playoff. Taylor had a long putt on the final hole to do it, but just missed.
