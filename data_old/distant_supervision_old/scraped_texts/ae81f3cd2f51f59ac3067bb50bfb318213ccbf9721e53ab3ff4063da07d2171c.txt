1960 State Championship Game
Farrell 60   Radnor 41
The feature article in the March 28, 1960 edition of the Sharon Herald 
proclaimed that "Farrell is the unchallengeable basketball 
capital of Pennsylvania"   --"they proved that fact
conclusively when they rolled up their fifth PIAA Class A championship with a
60-41 victory over Radnor at the Farm Show Arena in Harrisburg." 
(Remember, in 1960 the classifications were A, B, C, then later they were
renamed AAA, AA, A, then they were expanded to AAAA, AAA, AA, and A).
Farrell took the lead 23-22 with 2 seconds in the half when Brian Generalovich
tipped in a missed shot.
"Farrell High School became the only school in Pennsylvania history and Coach
McCluskey the only mentor to ever win five state crowns, the last two in a row."
