Some FAQ's....-There are NEVER any registration fees for the contestants EVER!!! :)
-All approved contestants & sponsors will receive (1) parking pass & (1) 3-day participant pass!! (a $75 value!!) How many other shows give you a full weekend pass and FREE parking!!
-Contestants & sponsors are permitted to do photoshoots with anyone whom they choose to during any portion of the show.  The only thing that the contest requires is that any contestant or winner is to pose for promotional photos with sponsors of the show after the contestant ends.  Also, please inquire to us directly if anyone approaches you saying that they are a sponsor of the show and they are NOT listed on my list here on our official page.  This is for the protection of all contestants and friends/family of contestants.
-No nudity, bikinis, burlesque costumes, Halloween costumes, inappropriate clothing, or lewd/obscene language is permitted during the contest.  This is a family friendly venue.  A contestant will be disqualified immediately in the event of this occurring.  You are welcome to email Pearl any questions you have or the page here.
-Wardrobe must fit into 20s-60s style only...!  Clothing does not need to be vintage but it is best to have a retro feel to your wardrobe.  If you need assistance, please let us know!!  We will be publishing a list of retro/vintage style clothing retailers to purchase or rent from!!
-Any contestant who placed as a runner up or 3rd place in the previous years WILL BE permitted to enter the show again!  Only Grand Prize winners are unable to enter again, but will be invited back to assist with the show each year if they would like to.  :)
Registration will start after Christmas in December of 2015.  Only 25-30 contestants will be chosen for the show!  We will have a wait list in the event that the show is filled.
