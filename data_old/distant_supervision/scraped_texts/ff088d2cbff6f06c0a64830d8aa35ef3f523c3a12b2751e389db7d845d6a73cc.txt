[Chorus]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman, got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
[Verse 2]
Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
But for now, we can stay here for a while
Cause you know, I just want to see your smile
[Bridge]
And when you're weak, I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holding on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long
Darling, and when you feel like hope is gone
Just run into my arms
