<div class="col-md-4 datalabel">Funding Opportunity Purpose</div>
      <div class="col-md-8 datacolumn"><p>Approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the
          United States experience a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. The
          early phase of psychotic illness is widely viewed as a critical opportunity
          for indicated prevention, and a chance to alter the downward trajectory and
          poor outcomes associated with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.
          Compared to traditional treatment approaches, programs that integrate
          pharmacologic, psychological, and rehabilitation interventions for FEP, i.e.,
          team-based Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC), have been found to produce a
          range of positive clinical and functional outcomes. However, the timing of
          treatment is critical; short and long-term outcomes are better when
          individuals begin treatment close to the onset of psychosis. Unfortunately, numerous
          studies find a substantial delay between the onset of psychotic symptoms and
          the initiation of FEP care; in the U.S. treatment is typically delayed
          between one and three years. Early identification of FEP, rapid referral to evidence-based
          services, and effective engagement in CSC are essential to shortening the
          duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and pre-empting the functional
          deterioration common in psychotic disorders. The World Health Organization
          advocates reducing DUP to 3 months or less. Accordingly, this Funding
          Opportunity Announcement (FOA) seeks planning grant applications that (1)
          identify a baseline rate of DUP in community settings that include CSC
          programs; (2) map referral pathways to CSC care, (3) identify bottlenecks and
          gaps in the pathway to CSC care, and (4) develop and pilot test feasible
          strategies for substantially reducing DUP among persons with FEP.    </p></div>

  <div class="heading4">Background</div>
  <p>Approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the
    United States experience a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. The
    early phase of psychotic illness is widely viewed as a critical opportunity for
    indicated prevention, and a chance to alter the downward trajectory and poor
    outcomes associated with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.
    Compared to traditional treatment approaches, programs that integrate
    pharmacologic, psychological, and rehabilitation interventions for FEP, i.e.,
    team-based Coordinated Specialty care (CSC), have been found to produce a range
    of positive clinical and functional outcomes, including reduced symptoms, greater
    involvement in work or school, and improved quality of life. However, the
    timing of treatment is critical; short and long-term outcomes are better when
    individuals begin treatment close to the onset of psychosis. </p>
  <p>International consensus statements from the World Health
    Organization recommend that specialty care for FEP start within 3 months of
    illness onset. However, more than two dozen studies conducted worldwide have
    observed a substantial delay (on average 2 years) between the appearance of
    psychotic symptoms and the initiation of treatment. Two influential
    meta-analyses clearly establish that the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP),
    the time between the onset of psychosis and initiation of treatment, is
    correlated with poor outcome. In the United States, DUP ranges between one and
    three years, suggesting that many people with FEP are missing a critical
    opportunity to benefit from early psychosis intervention.</p>
  <p>Research suggests that DUP can be reduced by enhancing early
    detection, treatment referral, and clinical engagement mechanisms. Reducing DUP
    in the United States from current levels of 1-3 years to the international
    standard of no more than 3 months should be a major focus of applied research
    efforts. Research to improve FEP case identification and referral in the United
    States is a logical complement to other NIMH initiatives on improving outcomes
    for people with FEP, such as the <a
href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/index.shtml">Recovery
    After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) </a> initiative, which found
    that CSC produced superior clinical and functional improvements compared to
    typical care, especially among clients with shorter DUP.</p>
  <div class="heading4">Research Objectives </div>
  <p>This FOA aims to support research that will (1) investigate
    early links in the FEP case identification and referral chain in the United
    States, and (2) develop feasible strategies for reducing delays in early
    detection, speedy referral, and rapid initiation of stage-specific treatment.
    The target population is not limited to first episode schizophrenia, but
    includes all persons experiencing a first episode of psychosis regardless of
    presenting DSM-IV diagnosis. Applicants are encouraged to base research
    activities in settings that link to treatment systems with CSC programs for
    FEP. A variety of configurations for FEP specialty care programs are possible,
    but evidence-based CSC treatment involves integrated, team-based care and
    typically feature use of single antipsychotic medications, prescribed in low doses;
    family psychoeducation; supported employment and/or education;
    cognitive-behavioral therapy oriented to recovery; coordination with primary
    care services; and continuity of care across inpatient and outpatient treatment
    settings.</p>
  <p>Applications submitted to this FOA are encouraged to develop
    and test the feasibility of strategies for reducing contributors to DUP within
    the selected community setting, based on results of the benchmarking
    activities. It is expected that pilot data from feasibility tests will be used
    to support applications for subsequent R01 intervention studies that will
    compare alternative methods for reducing DUP in community service settings. The
    strategies proposed to reduce DUP should aim to remove significant bottlenecks
    as well as close gaps in the pathway to specialty FEP care. NIMH encourages
    applications that explore approaches for producing one or more of the
    following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Better signal detection of psychosis onset, or symptoms
      suggesting high clinical risk of psychosis, within primary care settings,
      schools, child/youth mental health services, college counseling centers,
      emergency departments, criminal justice agencies, and/or other community
      settings;</li>
    <li> Methods to achieve expeditious referral of persons with FEP, or
      those at high clinical risk of psychosis, to an appropriate specialty care
      treatment program; and</li>
    <li> Strategies for achieving rapid initiation of and engagement in
      stage-specific FEP treatment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Applications submitted to this FOA should consider “supply
    side” approaches (e.g., targeting clinical and community systems), such as the
    development and testing of strategies for training primary care physicians and
    nurses, school and college counselors, emergency department staff, police, and
    mental health “generalists” to recognize signs of early psychosis, and the
    improvement of referral networks to fast-track the initiation of FEP care. This
    FOA is also intended to encourage “demand side” approaches (e.g., engaging
    people with FEP and their family members, friends, caregivers and others close
    to the affected individual) to improve recognition of early symptoms,
    help-seeking, access, and engagement in care for persons with FEP and/or youth
    at high clinical risk for psychosis, through education, decision-support
    systems, and other tools, including social marketing, social media and social
    networking.</p>
  <p>Research to reduce DUP requires expertise on the
    characteristics of service delivery systems and community settings in which DUP
    reduction strategies would be embedded, as well as expertise on the needs, life
    circumstances, and diversity of the population of young people with FEP and/or
    at high clinical risk of psychosis. Investigators should convey knowledge of
    DUP assessment strategies and factors that may contribute to treatment delays
    in the U.S. health care system. Multi-disciplinary research teams with
    complementary areas of expertise are encouraged. NIMH encourages applications
    that involve collaboration with stakeholders from multiple clinical or
    community practice settings, as well as consumers of services and their family
    members and social contacts. </p>
  <p>In addition, NIMH welcomes applications proposing to
    leverage existing practice research infrastructures such as the Mental Health
    Research Network (MHRN), the Clinical Translational Science Awards Program
    (CTSA) and other research and practice networks looking to conduct studies to
    reduce DUP. NIMH also welcomes coordination of DUP research with other public
    and private initiatives that specifically address early identification and
    treatment of young people at high risk for mental illness. For example, since
    2014 the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has
    supported the implementation of evidence-based treatment programs for FEP
    across the United States via a set-aside in the Community Mental Health Block
    Grant Program (CMHBG). The NIMH estimates that by 2017, over 100 CSC programs
    will be operating in 32 states, as a consequence of the CMHBG set-aside,
    representing a tremendous opportunity for advancing DUP reduction research.</p>
  <p>This FOA, and the companion FOA, <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-265.html">PAR-16-265</a>,
    support experimental and quasi-experimental studies focused on designing,
    refining, and testing algorithms of practical and accurate case identification
    of persons with FEP and/or at high risk of psychosis within a myriad of
    possible clinical and community contexts, in combination with strategies that
    promote rapid referral to the appropriate stage-specific specialty care.</p>
  <div class="heading4">Research Topics</div>
  <p>Applications to this FOA should focus on practical and
    reproducible strategies to achieve substantial DUP reduction for persons with
    FEP. The NIMH encourages applications in which referral to CSC programs is
    feasible. This FOA supports studies on the research topics listed below, which
    are intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Testing the effectiveness of strategies to improve identification
      and referral of patients with FEP within emergency service systems to appropriate
      stage-specific care.</li>
    <li> Improving case identification and referral of patients with FEP
      within non-specialty clinical and community systems (e.g., primary care, high
      schools, criminal justice settings, college campuses, or workplace).</li>
    <li> Improving access and engagement in care of persons in the
      high-risk state for psychosis, resulting in rapid FEP identification and entry
      into specialty FEP care.</li>
    <li> Improving recognition of symptoms and increasing help-seeking
      behavior among people with FEP and those at high risk of psychosis. </li>
    <li> Improving recognition of symptoms and increasing help-seeking
      behavior among people with FEP who often experience the highest levels of
      health disparities, including members of racial or ethnic minority groups or
      persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. </li>
    <li> Improving recognition of early psychosis symptoms among family
      members and friends of persons with FEP, and facilitating their help-seeking
      and supportive behaviors on behalf of individuals with FEP.</li>
    <li> Developing and testing decision-support tools, including those

    Investigators considering applying to this FOA are encouraged to contact the <a
href="#_Scientific/Research_Contact(s)">Scientific/Research Contact</a> for
    this FOA for additional guidance prior to submitting an application.
    Investigators who have already completed significant developmental or pilot
    work in this area should consider an application to <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-265.html">PAR-16-265</a>.</p>
  <p>The R34 should propose the developmental work to be
    performed that would enhance the probability of success in a larger study.
    Designs need not be reduced scope versions of the anticipated larger study, but
    should instead attempt to develop and refine the research strategies to be
    utilized in the subsequent large-scale study. NIMH recognizes that while the
    scope of interest for this FOA is consistent across both this and the companion
    FOA, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-16-265.html">PAR-16-265</a>,
    there are specific research topics for which the field may not yet be ready for
    a large-scale trial. This FOA provides the opportunity for “high risk, high
    reward studies” that may be of high priority to the NIMH. Thus, appropriate
    research activities for this FOA might include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Refining and pilot testing strategies for reducing DUP among
      people with FEP. </li>
    <li> Working out the details of the study protocols and randomization
      procedures (if appropriate). </li>
    <li> Examining the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants
      into the study conditions. </li>
    <li> Developing supportive materials and resources. </li>
    <li> Collecting preliminary data regarding feasibility, acceptability,
      safety, tolerability, mechanisms of change and outcomes. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Given the intended pilot nature of this FOA, conducting a
    formal test of outcomes is not required and obtaining an estimate of an effect
    size may not be possible. </p>

  <p>All instructions in the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide
    must be followed, with the following additional instructions:  </p>
  <p><strong>Research
    Strategy:</strong> For the initial “benchmarking” phase of the research,
    applications submitted to this FOA should (1) specify a scientifically
    acceptable operational definition of DUP; (2) use reliable measures to quantify
    overall DUP among persons who enroll in FEP specialty care; (3) map the various
    pathways that channel persons with FEP to CSC care programs; and (4) identify
    bottlenecks and gaps in these referral pathways, including barriers that impede
    the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Recognition of psychotic symptoms</li>
    <li> Referral to mental health treatment</li>
    <li> Diagnosis of a psychotic disorder </li>
    <li> Referral to a CSC program</li>
    <li> Enrollment in a CSC program and/or initiation of CSC treatment</li>
    <li> Engagement in CSC services</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Applications should propose a DUP reduction approach that
    has the potential to substantially reduce DUP in the target population of
    people with FEP. Applications should also describe novel strategies proposed
    for reducing DUP among people with FEP and/or measuring DUP in community
    treatment settings in the U.S. The application should describe a project that
    involves substantial DUP reduction for persons with FEP as a primary outcome. </p>
  <p>Applications should describe appropriate study milestones
    that are clearly defined for all of the study aims. The milestones should be
    feasible and quantifiable and described in the context of the study timeline.
    Potential challenges that may result in enrollment shortfalls should be
    discussed, along with and corresponding solutions to address enrollment
    problems. </p>
  <p>Applications should describe the multi-disciplinary features
    of the proposed research team, including team members' complementary areas of
    expertise. </p>
  <p>The application should also describe collaborations with
    stakeholders from multiple clinical or community practice settings, as well as with
    consumers of services and their family members and social contacts, detailing stakeholders'
    engagement in the research process, including project design.  </p>
  <p><em>For
    projects involving a clinical trial:</em></p>
  <p>Applications should identify the target(s) of the proposed
    services intervention to reduce DUP and provide evidence of the association
    between those targets and the outcomes of interest (e.g., DUP, symptoms, and functioning).
    The application should also provide evidence that: 1) the outcome measures have
    been validated or will be validated during the pilot work, 2) the outcomes
    measured include stakeholder relevant outcomes, 3) the intervention could be
    implemented in typical service settings using typically available personnel and
    resources, and 4) fidelity in intervention delivery will be monitored. Include
    the following:  </p>
  <p>(1) a conceptual framework that clearly identifies the
    target(s)/mechanism(s) and the empirical evidence linking the
    target(s)/mechanism(s) to the reduction in DUP; </p>
  <p>(2) plans for assessing whether the services intervention
    engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) using valid measures that are as direct and
    objective as is feasible, including the specific measures, the assessment
    schedule, and the justification for the assessment strategy (e.g., evidence
    regarding the validity and feasibility of the proposed measures);  </p>
  <p>(3) an analytic strategy for data analyses that will be used
    to examine whether the intervention engages the target(s) and whether
    intervention-induced changes in the target(s) are associated with reduction in
    DUP (i.e., mediation).  </p>
  <p>(4) justification for the sample size in terms of
    feasibility goals; and</p>
  <p>(5) a clear rationale for the choice of methods proposed.</p>
  <p>In the case of multi-element interventions, the application
    should specify the conceptual basis, assessment plan, and analytic strategy, as
    detailed above, for the target(s)/mechanism(s) corresponding to each DUP
    reduction intervention element. </p>
  <p><strong>Protections
    for Human Subjects:</strong> Applications with data collection plans
    that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients,
    therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions
    for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant
    groups, accordingly. </p>
  <p>The NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for
    investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data
    and safety monitoring (<a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-15-025.html">NOT-MH-15-025</a>). 
    The application’s Protection of Human Subjects section should reflect the
    policies and guidance in this notice.  Plans for the protection of
    research subjects and data and safety monitoring will be reviewed by the NIMH
    for consistency with NIMH and NIH policies and federal regulations.</p>

  <div class="heading4">Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research</div>
  <p>NIMH encourages the use of common data elements (CDEs) in
    basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human
    subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and
    advance research across studies.  CDEs are data elements that have been
    identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different
    studies.  Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to
    improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and
    sources, including electronic health records.  NIH ICs have identified
    CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., mental illness), types of studies (e.g.
    genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g.,
    patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare
    Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository).  NIH has established a
    “Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal" (<a
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cde/">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cde/</a>) to assist investigators in
    identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms,
    and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about
    and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for
    the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. 
    Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal, in particular the Consensus
    Measures for Phenotypes and eXposures Mental Health Research Toolkit (<a
href="https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/">https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/</a>), and describe in their
    applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their
    projects. </p>

  <div class="heading2"><a name="_Section_V._Application"></a>Section V. Application Review Information</div>
  <div class="heading3"><a name="_1._Criteria"></a>1.
    Criteria</div>
  <p>Only the review criteria described below will be considered
    in the review process. As part of the <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149">NIH mission</a>,
    all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral
    research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer
    review system.</p>
  <p>For this particular announcement, note the following: </p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>This FOA supports the development and/or pilot
    testing of new or adapted interventions, pilot testing of interventions with
    demonstrated efficacy in broader scale effectiveness trials, or conducting
    pilot innovative services research that requires preliminary testing or
    development. Because this is a clinical exploratory/developmental grant
    application, it need not have extensive background material or preliminary information
    as one might normally expect in an R01 application. Accordingly, reviewers will
    focus their evaluation on the conceptual framework, the level of innovation,
    and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Reviewers
    will be instructed to place less emphasis on methodological details and certain
    indicators traditionally used in evaluating the scientific merit of R01
    applications, including supportive preliminary data. Appropriate justification
    for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from
    other sources, or, when available, from investigator generated data.
    Preliminary data are not required for R34 applications, but may be included if
    available.</p>
  <div class="heading4">Overall Impact </div>
  <p>Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect
    their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained,
    powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the
    following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the
    project proposed).</p>
  <div class="heading4">Scored Review Criteria</div>
  <p>Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in
    the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An
    application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to
    have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not
    innovative may be essential to advance a field.</p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Significance</div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Does the project address an
    important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a
    strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved,
    how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice
    be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts,
    methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that
    drive this field?  </p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Does the proposed approach have the
    potential to substantially reduce DUP in the target population of people with
    FEP?   </p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Investigator(s)</div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators,
    and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators
    or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they
    have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they
    demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their
    field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators
    have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach,
    governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?  Do the
    qualifications of the PD/PI and other senior investigators include expertise in
    the identification and treatment of people with FEP and expertise in the
    service delivery systems or community settings in which the selected DUP
    reduction strategies would be embedded? Do research team members have
    complementary areas of expertise?   </p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Innovation</div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Does the application challenge and
    seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing
    novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or
    interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation,
    or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a
    refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches
    or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Are novel
    strategies proposed for reducing DUP among people with FEP and/or measuring DUP
    in community treatment settings in the U.S.?   </p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Approach</div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Are the overall strategy,
    methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the
    specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to
    ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are
    potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success
    presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the
    strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have
    the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological
    variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects?  </p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>Does the project include a scientifically acceptable
    operational definition of DUP? Are methods described for obtaining reliable
    estimates of DUP in community programs? Does the project include substantial
    DUP reduction for persons with FEP as a primary outcome? If clinical, community
    or public health settings are involved, are stakeholders sufficiently engaged
    in the research process, including project design?</p>
  <p class=P_SingleIndent>For projects involving a clinical trial, does the
    application provide evidence of the association between the intervention
    target(s) and the endpoint(s) of interest? Are the outcome measures validated
    and are stakeholder relevant outcomes included? Does the application describe
    the monitoring of fidelity in intervention delivery in community practice
    settings? Does the application provide justification for the sample size in
    terms of feasibility goals? Is there a clear rationale for the choice of
    methods proposed? </p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Does the application describe
    appropriate milestones that are clearly defined for all of the study aims?</p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Does the project involve
    collaborations with relevant stakeholders?</p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">If the project involves human
    subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the
    protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or
    exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as
    well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the
    scientific goals and research strategy proposed?   </p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Environment</div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">Will the scientific environment in
    which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the
    institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the
    investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from
    unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or
    collaborative arrangements?    </p>
  <div class="heading4">Additional Review Criteria</div>
  <p>As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will
    evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and
    technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give
    separate scores for these items.</p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Protections for Human Subjects</div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">For research that involves human
    subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are
    exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for
    involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk
    relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria:
    1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential
    benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be
    gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials.</p>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">For research that involves human
    subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of
    research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1)
    the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and
    characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on
    review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175">Guidelines for the Review of Human
    Subjects</a>.</p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Inclusion of Women, Minorities,
    and Children </div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">When the proposed project involves
    human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will
    evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on
    the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or
    exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the
    scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on
    review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the <a
href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174">Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion
    in Clinical Research</a>.</p>
  <div class="heading4Indent">Vertebrate Animals</div>
  <p class="P_SingleIndent">The committee will evaluate the
    involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment
    according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures
    involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to
    be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models
    and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to
    minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for
    euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia
    of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any
    other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional

  <p>Recipients of federal financial
    assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with
    federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure
    equal access to their programs without regard to a person’s race, color,
    national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion.
    This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited
    English proficiency.  HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited
    in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal
    investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment
    requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols
    that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where
    nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate
    with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study
    design, or the purpose of the research.</p>
  <p>For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply
    to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is
