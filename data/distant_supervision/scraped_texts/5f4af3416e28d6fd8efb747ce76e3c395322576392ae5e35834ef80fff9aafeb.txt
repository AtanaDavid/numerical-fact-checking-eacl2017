"I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed."- Robert H. Schuller
Steven is an American Jew was the one who wanted to revamp World Harmony Day website This was what he said when he agreed to come on board,
“I think what you’re trying to achieve is wonderful, and in fact can work and bring about change, as it has been done in many other movements around the world. If no one does this, then who will? We must be the change we wish to see in the world, and we have to start somewhere to begin that change. I also appreciate your sentiment in wanting to use my services. That makes me feel like my life is giving something good to someone who deserves only the very best, and a cause that will hopefully bring about a change in the world for the better for everyone.”
The Significance of World Harmony Day
1) World Harmony Day aims to eventually be a worldwide event involving people of different races and religions to stand for peace and harmony.
2) Through the 2 minutes of peace silence and opportunities through all avenues in the creative, performing, technical and visual arts on the 20th of Feb every year.
3) World Harmony Day strives to become relevant to today’s dynamic society by showcasing the message of PEACE, HARMONY & UNITY through activities which can help the basic message achieve visibility throughout the year.
LET'S MAKE WORLD HARMONY DAY 20th FEBRUARY 2017 A REALITY BECAUSE ROTSCHILD ZIONISM IS PREPARING IN CERN FOR THEIR 'god' LUCIFER TO TAKE OVER GOD'S KINGDOM!
The Consciousness are coming together as one global family to bring down these Devils and we will succeed because ALMIGHTY GOD IS WITH US to bring everlasting peace & harmony to our world!
World Harmony Day Consumed My Life And In Fact It's My Life.
War is when your government tells you who the enemy is. Revolution is when you figure it out yourself.
Dear 7 Billion Brothers & Sisters around the world,
World Harmony Day is on 20th February 2017, I hope all of you can gather your family and friends to observe a 2 min PEACE SILENCE at 8.02pm.
All religions and cultures have a special day - like Christmas, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa or Chinese New Year.
February 20th is World Harmony Day. This is a day to celebrate ALL of humanity as one global family.
On this day, at 8:02pm, wherever you are, a portion of humanity will come together - lighting candles and observing a 2 Minute Peace Silence. This act is not only symbolic, but most importantly, will bring hope to the rest of the world.
As this is happening all over the World, it will create a wave of Harmony and become one collective voice - visualising love, light, peace, harmony and unity.
I tell you a big secret the Devils are afraid of LOVE and this is the weapon we going to use on World Harmony Day to defeat our common enemy the Evil Rotschild Zionism!
My teacher said that those who love God will be doing their work individually. Somehow in late 2011 I discovered YOUTUBE and I was in 'TOTAL SHOCK'! I saw a 'JUNGLE' and most importantly I saw my contribution is working fearlessly to bring out the truth even though the evil Zionist Joos keep making it harder and harder for me to post. (Sometimes feel like giving up but deep down my spine I know I cannot and I must not because we are very close in reaching our goal to wipe these devils off the map.) She said that one day all these spiritual workers will come together to connect the dots and this is how we are going to save the world.
On World Harmony Day we are reminding humanity that God had given only One World to us and we must learn how to share this World for peace and harmony to prevail. This act is not only symbolic, but most importantly we are standing by GOD and this will bring hope to the rest of the world. As this is happening all over the World, it will create a wave of Harmony and become one collective voice - visualising love, light, peace, harmony and unity. (you don't try you don't know so let keep on visualising this Possibility:)
Remembered, YOU ARE SOUL and THE SOUL IS THE ENERGY and THE SOUL NEVER DIE! It is time to fight back with courage and don't ever forget WE ARE 7 BILLION STRONG and you know what I got an army called Sunflower Pacifist Army they are working very hard too by sharing my blogs!
OK, DO YOU WANT TO STOP WW3? IF YOU DO THEN MAKE WORLD HARMONY DAY 20th FEBRUARY 2017 A REALITY AND WHEN IT HAPPENS THIS MEAN ROTSCHILD ZIONISM WILL BE DEFEATED FOREVER!
