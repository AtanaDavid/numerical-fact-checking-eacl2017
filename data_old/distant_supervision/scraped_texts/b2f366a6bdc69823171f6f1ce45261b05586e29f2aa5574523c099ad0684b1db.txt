(VIENNA) -  The number of unaccompanied children seeking asylum in the European Union is likely to rise due to ongoing conflicts and the economic crisis, an EU rights group warned Friday.
Children who had been separated from their families or were victims of human traffickers were "particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses," the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) said in a summary report.
Last year, some 15,000 unaccompanied children claimed asylum in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland, according to the UN's refugee agency UNHCR.
Given the number of ongoing conflicts and the recent economic crisis, "it is reasonable to assume that the number of separated, asylum-seeking children will rise," FRA director Morten Kjaerum said in the report.
These were often boys aged 14 and above from Africa, Iraq or Afghanistan, he noted.
Based on interviews with 336 children and over 300 caretakers in 12 EU member states, the report found that children were not always consulted on decisions affecting their future or well-informed about their legal rights.
The EU must therefore adopt a clear legal framework to protect them, the agency urged.
Lone, asylum-seeking children were keen to mix with their host society and attend school with local youngsters, and they should be given more opportunity to do so, the agency said.
But many children did not know whether they had a guardian to oversee their asylum procedure and act as a parent, while many guardians or caretakers did not have appropriate training, it said.
The agency also criticised the "very long and arduous processes that make the children feel insecure and unprotected."
A full report was expected in June.
