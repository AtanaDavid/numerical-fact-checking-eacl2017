One of the main surprises in LVG's team selection is the absence of Marcus Rashford.
The 18-year-old has set the Premier League alight since breaking into the first team, with an England call-up being touted.
But Rashford isn't even named on the bench at Carrow Road, with Anthony Martial given the nod upfront.
Memphis Depay is handed a rare start as he attempts to salvage his Old Trafford career.
