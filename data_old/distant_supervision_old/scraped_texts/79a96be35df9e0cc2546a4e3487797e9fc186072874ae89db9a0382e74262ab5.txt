Billy Casper opened with a 66 and led the first three rounds of the 1969 Masters, but what counts is who leads after the final round, and that wasn't Casper.
Coming out of the final round in the lead was George Archer, one of the tallest players of his era at 6-foot-5. Archer trailed Casper by one stroke at the start of the final round, but carded a 72 to Casper's 74 to finish with the one-stroke victory. Casper's stumbling-out-of-the-gate start did him in: He was 5-over through the first 10 holes of Round 4.
It was Archer's only major championship victory. He won 12 times in PGA Tour events.
Sharing second with Casper were George Knudson and Tom Weiskopf. Weiskopf never won The Masters, but finished second four times, sharing the record for most runner-up finishes. Weiskopf had a share of the lead until bogeying the 17th hole.
