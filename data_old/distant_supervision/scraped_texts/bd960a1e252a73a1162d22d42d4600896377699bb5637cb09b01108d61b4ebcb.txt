CEMEX is increasingly involved in the supply of recycled and
secondary materials. These vary from china clay waste,
crushed glass and construction / demolition waste from many sources.
The use of recycled asphalt and road planings is also a growing area of
activity.
Recycled concrete can be created by breaking, removing, and crushing existing concrete to a preferred size. It is commonly used as a base layer for other construction materials because it compacts to form a firm surface.
At CEMEX we operate landfill sites across the UK in accordance with current Landfill Regulations allowing us to generate materials for the important process of restoring our sites to their agreed after use. Our units offer vital tipping facilities to the local muck-away industry and often these operations are aligned with recycling to generate secondary aggregate for re-use in the construction industry.
The early stages of the construction process can involve the removal of material to facilitate the scheme and our operations typically accept inert waste in keeping with our pollution-prevention control permits which covers a range of non-biodegradable wastes.
In addition to these local road-based operations, CEMEX will explore options to move waste by train to appropriate locations for larger schemes in order to minimise vehicle movements. Due to the nature of these contracts, we assess the opportunity on a contract specific basis.
