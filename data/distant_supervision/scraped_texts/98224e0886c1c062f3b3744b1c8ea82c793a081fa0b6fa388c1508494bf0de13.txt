Admission into Year 7 at KEGS is determined by the 11+ examination and our Admissions Policies can be found below.  A 12½ mile priority admissions area was introduced which took effect from the September 2013 intake - 80% of places are reserved for students who live within this area.  We also increased our intake into Year 7 from 120 to 150, which took effect from the September 2015 intake.
