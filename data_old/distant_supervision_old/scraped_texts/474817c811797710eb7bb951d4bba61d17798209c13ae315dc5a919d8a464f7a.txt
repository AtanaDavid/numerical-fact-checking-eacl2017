Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 will be available from July 29.
Over the coming weeks, customers will be able to reserve a free copy if they are currently running Windows 7 or 8.1. Users will receive a notification in their taskbar notifying them they can upgrade.
If you reserve your upgrade, Windows 10 will start immediately downloading to your device when it is available.
Microsoft's next operating system is bringing back the Start menu, which is happy news for many people. You can find out what else is new with Windows 10 right here on IGN.
