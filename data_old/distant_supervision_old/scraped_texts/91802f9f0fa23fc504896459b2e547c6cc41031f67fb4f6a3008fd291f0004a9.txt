First staged back in 1934, when Horton Smith triumphed, Augusta has been the scene of many iconic golf moments such as the legendary Jack Nicklaus’ unforgettable eagle on the way to becoming the oldest Masters champion in 1986 – 23 years after the first of his six titles – and Tiger Woods’ remarkable chip-in on the final day in 2005.
Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Tom Watson, Seve Ballesteros, Nick Faldo and more recently Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson are among the elite group of players to etch their names into Masters history with repeat victories but there’s also been a fair share of final-day agony.
In 1996, Greg Norman’s course record-equalling 63 was consolidated with solid rounds of 69 and 71 to give him a six-shot lead over Nick Faldo but a disastrous 78 on Sunday allowed the Englishman to claim a third Green Jacket.
Similar heartache was suffered by Rory McIlroy in 2011 when, at the age of just 21, he held a four-shot advantage heading into the final day. But it all went wrong in dramatic fashion as he dropped seven shots over the final nine holes to finish well down the field.
