&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: carolina milanesi - HoloLens very different approach to augmented reality than Google Glass &amp;amp; goes to the core of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23Windows10" target="_blank"&gt;#Windows10&lt;/a&gt; being a more personal experience&lt;/noframe&gt;
19.06 "We want to move from people needing Windows, to choosing Windows, to loving Windows," he says.
19.05 &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Mitchell Wilston - This is really great product placement by Apple at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23windows10" target="_blank"&gt;#windows10&lt;/a&gt; briefing &lt;a href="http://t.co/7os04HxiXn" target="_blank"&gt;http://t.co/7os04HxiXn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt; He's right - a room full of MacBooks.
19.04 Satya Nadella now on stage. "These are the kinds of magical moments we live for," he says.
17.46 The Office ribbon is now in the phone's app bar.
17.46 Word, Excel and PowerPoint will be included for Windows 10 for smaller devices.
17.45 The first app will be Office.
17.44 "We need to talk about universal apps," he says.
17.40 He's pulled out a Lumia 1520 running the new system. Fully customisable background, which customers have been asking for, and newly installed apps will be promoted in the right hand corner.
17.38 Ooh a focus on phones and small tablets now, Belfiore says. We're going to see Windows 10 for devices sized under 8-inches.
17.35 Cortana has been developed to be more intuitive than ever, understanding how to categorise data from search terms like "Photos from December", and indexing your drive and OneDrive. And dictate emails, as you can do with iOS's Siri.
17.31 "One of the key premises of Cortana is that she is a personal digitial assistant, and that she will get to know you," Belfiore says.
17.30 Cortana will pop up with useful information and notifications while on your desktop.
17.28 Digital assistant Cortana is showing off her accents, including a slightly dodgy British one, and an impression of Yoda. For the first time, it will be available on the PC.
17.27 Cortana demo - "I correctly predicted most of the World Cup games," she says.
17.26 This just in from Jacques Kotze, COO of ad tech firm Adludio says: “You cannot underestimate how important this is for Microsoft. It is arguably the first real attempt from the company to position itself ahead of the market again, instead of reacting to the innovations of Android and IOS. Windows10 has a very grand vision for how Microsoft's operating system can work for devices beyond mobile, to include the Internet of Things, and there is also clear support for their Cloud based offerings.
"This should be a wake up call to everyone who has written Microsoft off, they have an incredible talent pool and it would be a refreshing game changer if they manage to start innovating to their true potential by shaking off the shackles of their big corporate past.”
17.24 Interesting music choice...
17.22 Windows 10 has a clean, straight-forward looking interface we first saw in September. Confusion between the control panel and settings functions has been resolved.
17.20 It's demo time, and Belfiore is talking us through the search bar. One of the features people have asked about a lot it to take the Start menu full-screen, he says.
17.19 Joe Belfiore, corporate vice-president of operating systems is up next, followed by Xbox's Phil Spencer.
17.18 Windows 10 to be offered as a free upgrade for the first year from Windows 7, 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. Imagine consumers will jump at the chance for that.
17.17 "In the next few years... Microsoft could easily be one of the biggest internet services on the planet."
17.12 "It's important that our customers' privacy is respected, and they trust their devices."
17.10 'More personal computing' is the new focus, says Myerson. "It should be easy to put one device down, pick up another and carry on where you left off". A bit like iOS 8's Continuity then?
17.07 Microsoft is putting huge emphasis on how it's listened to feedback from developers and Windows Insiders to create the new system. Interesting democratic approach.
17.06 "Stay tuned as our device family expands," he says. What could it be?
17.03 "Windows 10 will be our best enterprise platform ever," he adds. Cool.
17.02 "The feedback we've received since launching Windows 10, has truly helped to shape Windows 10," says Myerson.
17.00 And we're off! Terry Myerson has taken to the stage.
16.42 Windows 10 has been optimised to work seemlessly across all platforms, from its smartphones to giant screens. Looking forward to those demonstrations:
16.34 Cryptic tweeting from the company's MVP on Windows platform development Dan Ardelean:
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Dan Ardelean - Next chapter starts 1.21.15 =&amp;#62; 1+2+1+1+5= 1*2*1*1*5 = &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23Windows10" target="_blank"&gt;#Windows10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23excited" target="_blank"&gt;#excited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
16:30 Spencer is expected to join Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella onstage in Redmond, Washington this afternoon, alongside corporate vice president of operating systems Joe Belfiore and executive vice president Terry Myerson.
16.10 Head of Xbox Phil Spencer is hinting at a big announcement for Xbox fans:
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Phil Spencer - Great to have Xbox/Gaming in a Windows event today. Make sure you stay watching until the end of show, cool stuff there. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23Windows10" target="_blank"&gt;#Windows10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
16.06 If you're curious as to what the new system will hold, Graham Ruddick has rounded up everything we know so far about Windows 10 - including the return of the Start menu, and how it'll be cross platform-friendly.
16:00 Good afternoon, and welcome to our live blog of Microsoft's grand unveiling of latest operating system Windows 10. The Windows 10: The Next Chapter event kicks off at 17:00 GMT.
