Cartoonists and artists have posted emotive images in response to the attack in Nice which killed 84 people, many of them children.
Some 50 people remain critically injured after a lorry driver ploughed into crowds celebrating France's national Bastille Day in Nice on Thursday evening.
Under the trending hashtag 'Pray for Nice', illustrator Carlos Latuff posted a provocative image of doll crying next to the body of a child.
The drawing was shared by broadcaster Jeremy Vine next to the photograph that had inspired it.
