The competition, which drew 18 teams from across Saskatchewan, includes five separate events: Fire Fighting, First Aid, Proficiency Skills, Practical Skills and simulated Surface and Underground Mine Problems.
The events are designed to test the miners’ abilities and knowledge in emergency situations that can arise at their sites.
“Our mine rescue teams are an integral part of our company’s operations,” said Mark Fracchia, President, PCS Potash. “Thanks to them, our employees can go to work each day knowing there are trained, knowledgeable responders on site if ever needed.
“We are grateful for their dedication and commitment to emergency response and the high level of expertise they have acquired.”
