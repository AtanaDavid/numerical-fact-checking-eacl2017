15.38 "That's the worst back four you will ever see for Man United," says Jamie Redknapp. Ha.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Matthew Stanger - When United were outclassed here last year, there was no feeling they would improve. They'll beat City at OT if they continue in this vein.&lt;/noframe&gt;
15.32 Vincent Kompany presents the MoM away to Yaya.
"I think we played very well," says Yaya, who says "definitely a penalty" when asked about being brought down in the box in the first half.
"There's no real reason for why we played nervously at the end, they had a couple of chances, but it's a good win," Vincent Kompany. "A derby win is massive, we are not thinking about the league table, we are just thinking about the city."
Lovely movement for Aguero for the goal. Lost his marker (young McNair) expertly.
MAN CITY 1 MAN UNITED 0 All the reaction coming up. City really made their fans sweat for that. United, I think, did pretty well, having gone down to ten men on 39 minutes. I suppose it's the sort of battling performance that a manager can cite as evidence of team spirit, etc. That said, United now have their lowest points total at this stage of a season since 1986... when one A Ferguson was brought in to sort things out. City have won four Manc derbies in a row for the first time since 1970.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: John Brewin - Whatever the points differences compared to this time last season, United are much closer to City than they were in last season's fixture.&lt;/noframe&gt;
90+ mins: Nervy for City but in fairness United have not actually managed to create a chance for the last couple of minutes. The five minutes are nearly up but here comes Di Maria... United have lost it. Nasri wins a throw. That's it!
90+ mins: Fellaini has the ball in the centre of the park and Kompany lunges in with a silly tackle. The freekick is drilled forward for Fellaini, who is involved in a battle royale with Kompany. The decision goes in favour of the City man as they push and shove. Debatable to my mind. Shyam Remo:
I would like to appreciate manu for holding mancity as they are down to 10 by brutal reffree. I just want manu to draw this match !!!
90+ mins: Wilson breaks and Kompany has to slide in at the expense of the corner. Clichy needlessly hacks behind for a corner.
90 mins: It's played short and Fernandinho gets the better of McNair. He leaps and heads just over. Five minutes added.
89 mins: McNair has given it away and there's a super covering tackle from Valencia. Shaw tackles Zabaleta in the box, it's all hands to the pump. Corner City.
88 mins: Fernandinho plays the ball into Yaya. Classy spin-and-go as he turns away from his marker and curls a shot just a couple of feet wide.
87 mins: Somebody needs to tell Man City that this is not Fergie-era United. The men in blue are playing with real fear here.
85 mins: Rooney everywhere. Freeing Di Maria down the left. And now he's into the area to get on the return ball. Hard collision with Hart. Rooney is hurt. Oh, maybe it's cramp. Giggs is having a lovely time on the bench
84 mins: Kompany olbiged to concede a corner. Fellaini! Kompany did enough to get in the way. In fact, he got the final touch as it flies over the bar... but the ref does not see.
83 mins: Yaya pushed forward to number ten, Fernandinho alongside Fernando in the centre. City are clinging on.
80 mins: James Wilson, 18, comes on in favour of RVP. Fernandinho on for City. Aguero has a tantrum as he is subbed off.
79 mins: Di Maria has totally wasted the freekick. That run by Rooney a couple of minutes ago. Just fantastic to watch.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Sheridan Bird - I know there are reasons- fitness, age, role- but I wish Rooney would make runs like that more. That was Euro 2004 style. Cannonball&lt;/noframe&gt;
78 mins: Kompany into the book for sliding in on Di Maria. City are rattled. Phil Martin with some top trolling:
Smalling did not commit any offence for his first booking and the City had two players a yard offside for the goal.Scandalous referring.
76 mins: Scenes! Here's Rooney with a run into the box, he nutmegs Kompany but ends up running into Demichelis. No penalty. It drops for Di Maria, who fires the ball at goal. Pounded clear by heart. Zabaleta fouls, City sloppy here and they're letting United back into this. Freekick lofted into the box! Fellaini with the header! This is a great chance. Ooh he should have done better.
74 mins: Navas has hit the post! Bursts into the box down the right and pokes it at the goal. Panic stations for United, who just about manage to clear it.
73 mins: Zabaleta, to Navas, plays it in behind for Nasri - excellent move. But there's good old Michael Carrick to nick it away JUST in time. United just cannot get it clear. Rooney's lost it. The pressure is high.
71 mins: United having a good little spell. Played through the defence for Fellaini! Ah but he is sluggish getting onto it. Millesh Mohan Kumar:
With Rafael, Evans, Jones and Rojo now injured and Chris suspended, wonder what LVG will be thinking of for the upcoming matches. I hope Shaw doesn't get injured let alone MU score a goal today.
69 mins: The yeoman Milner off for the mecurial Nasri. He could be handful. Brian Kidd, for it is he, with some last-minute instructions. out of nothing RVP has made himself a chance down the right, cutting and twisting in the box and shooting from a (impossibly?) narrow angle. The underwhelming Jovetic off, Dzeko on. Before United's Di Maria takes an easily-cleared corner.
68 mins: Magnificent run from Yaya, no finer sight in the game than the big lad striding forward. Plays the pass neatly but it's just cut out by (?) Shaw before Navas can drift onto it.
66 mins: Samir Nasri is getting ready to come on. Meanwhile City have a corner. Cleared but not decisively. Clichy slips it inside to Jovetic, he curls a shot towards the far corner but De Gea saw that one coming. Acrobatic, rather flashy, save.
64 mins: United look to get back into it with RVP but there's little support.
GOAL! Yaya splits the defence down the left, Clichy with a perfect cut-back and Aguero makes no mistake with a laser-like finish from perhaps 15 yards. So crisp, so precise. Never in doubt. Tenth League goal of the season for him. City 1 United 0 (Aguero 63)
61 mins: Andrew Holgate writes:
I'm at the game. Michael Oliver is having an awful game as red.
I think Andrew means "as ref". Or maybe he does in fact mean "as Red". Certainly he could have been harder on United.
59 mins: Aguero dancing through the United area, Fellaini and Carrick come to get him. Aguero's looking for it, but he's caught by Carrick and Fellaini I think. At least one of them. At the other end, Di Maria has broken clear and, hello, Demichelis has brought him down for a card... a yellow card. Di Maria whips in a perfect freekick, nobody can get the touch.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Paul Hayward - Man Utd defence of Valencia (midfielder), Carrick (midfielder), McNair (19) and Shaw (19).&lt;/noframe&gt;
57 mins: City all over this, obviously. Toure and Zabaleta are trying to work it down the right. What City lack, with Silva out, is that creative intelligence to unpick two lines of four.
55 mins: Four minutes delay for that. City corner. Jovetic gets in front of Blind, heads at goal. Another corner. They clear this one. Valencia, Carrick, McNair, Shaw. You see that? That's your back four, that is.
50 mins: RVP loses it , Rojo comes out to make a slide tackle on Demichelis and that's risky... it's left United 3 v 4 as City break down the right. Navas crosses and it's turned behind. Rojo has hurt himself in that tackle, it looks like he has popped his shoulder out. Oof. Nasty one. They're giving him oxygen. Disolcated shoulder by the looks of it. Poor lad, that must knack bad. He'll play no further part, and there's going to be a chance for young Paddy McNair.
49 mins: Yaya striding down the right, Rooney matching him stride-for-stride, eventually Wayne tackles him, fairly. Needed to be - that was in the box.
48 mins: Clichy frees Aguero... little stumble. Rojo does well. Navas drills it at Fellaini, shouts for a handball. Not given. Now Navas again, crosses, Zabaleta fires over. Leaning back. Body position all wrong. Mabunda writes:
I just love the way Man United are playing today. They look so strong even though they been reduced to 10 men. I feel the goal coming from the Red Devils in the second half.
47 mins: Good vision from Rooney as he takes a quick, long freekick.... well cut out by Clichy, who was only drafted in at the last minute when Kolarov limped out of the warm-up. Bit of a one-man band at the moment for Man U; here's Rooney again trying to unlock the defence.
46 mins: Right then. No comedians on the pitch now, with Corden and Chris Smalling both off. Can ten men United hold out? City on the attack right away, Aguero and Toure looking dangerous but an offside flag shuts it down.
14.31 In the half-time entertainment, James Corden is taking a pen against Andrew Flintoff. Good penalty, top corner... and an even better save from the former England cricketer! Kisses the City badge.
14.30 Any hope for United? Here's George Alty:
Thankfully Utd appear to have messed this up because City have been pants lately. Though the prospect of still being pants in 45 miniutes time sadly remains within our own hands.
HALF TIME: Well, we've had a justified red card and City should have had definitely one and maybe two penalties. But United are still in it at nil-nil. They owe that to two very good, brave saves from De Gea. City must be red-hot favourites from here. Marc Melander:
Is it me or does Rooney resemble Old man Steptoe in that pic of him in your most excellent blog?
45+ mins: Toure's in the box, the ball's chipped through by Jovetic, Rojo has brought down Toure. Oliver blows the whsitle... for half time! Dear me. That looked like a penalty to me. Certainly the Fellaini/Aguero one was. This one, maybe Yaya was playing for it. Tougher call.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Paul Hayward - Smalling got double ice from Van Gaal and Giggs as he walked off. Didn't even acknowledge his existence.&lt;/noframe&gt;
43 mins: Janzaj is taken off in favour of Carrick. Navas wins a corner with a strong run. United defend the corner quite well, all things considered.
42 mins: Fellaini is into the centre back role and he's snapping at the heels of Aguero. Aguero down in the area. Should have been a penalty. Fellaini kicks the back of his ankle. Aguero stays down. City fans boo. Eventually, and I mean eventually, Valencia puts it out.
41 mins: United, in fairness, playing with some heart as they run at City but you have to fear for their chances.
39 mins: Milner stands the freekick up, nobody can get on it at the back stick.
38 mins: Smalling red card! He only has himself to blame. Milner down the left, pushes it past Smalling and goes. Smalling lunges in, catches Milner and this is a stone cold yellow card. Add in the idiotic first booking and Smalling has mugged his team off there. Joe Sullivan writes:
I haven't heard anyone being called a "ninny" in years! Liked it. Very apt as well.
37 mins: United lose it, Rooney shouts at his teammates and he himself has to disposses City.
35 mins: Better from Valencia though, showing good heart and energy to win the ball and tidy up. Nobody able to create much in a crowded midfield. Jovetic way back in there as well.
34 mins: Valencia "gets impatient" in the words of Gary Neville and plays his side into trouble when he leaves the line to meet Milner rather than keeping the shape. Lucky for the makeshift fullback, the ball forward is lacking.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Paul Hayward - Days from now ref Michael Oliver will still be hearing Wayne Rooney's voice in his head. Won't leave him alone.&lt;/noframe&gt;
32 mins: Di Maria gets free down the left but cannot produce much in the way of quality from the cross. Here's Angel DM at the other end helping snuff out a City move.
30 mins: Ball drilled across the City goal nbut nobody can react in time. In the end it seems to hit a United player (Fellaini?) at the back post. Smalling, the ninny, gets himself booked for trying to get in the way of Joe Hart's goal kick.
29 mins: Zabaleta late on RVP. Rooney wants to know why he doesn't get a booking. Reasonable point.
28 mins: Yaya himself takes the freekick; blazes over.
27 mins: Blind has caught Toure from behind and becomes the first player into the book.
26 mins: United under the pump now. City camped in their half. Jeers for Rojo as he nervily hacks it to touch.
23 mins: Toure and Milner a bit sloppy as Yaya delivers a freekick for Milner to run several yards offside.
21 mins: And another super move from City as Fernando gallops down the left and delivers a perfect stabbed ball with the outside of the boot... Aguero pounces. De Gea out bravely and that's a heavy collision between keeper and striker. Both okay. De Gea with his second good save in as many minutes.
20 mins: Best moment of the match for City as they cut United open and Navas fires a snap shot at De Gea. Valencia out of position and playing him onside.
19 mins: RVP loses the ball, it's played forward quickly and Aguero gets on the ball, striking a shot straight at the goalie.
18 mins: Aguero too quick for Rojo, who slides in and might well have been booked on another day. The freekick comes to nothing.
16 mins: 241 million is the figure being quoted about the cost of the United starting XI. Hope they got the receipt.
15 mins: Shaw with a speculative cross, Fellaini the target. Having a good game, Marouane. This cross easily dealt with through. United probably playing slightly the better stuff in a forgettable first quarter of an hour. United having something like 57% of the ball.
14 mins: Di Maria deep cross leads to RVP heading wide. Given too much space there, the Argentine.
13 mins: Clichy lucky not to be booked for hauling back Januzaj.
12 mins: Fussy refereeing gives City a free when Navas goes past Luke Shaw. If Shaw touched him, it must have been gossamer-gentle because both players looked surprised.
9 mins: United have a spell of the ball in the CIty half. Clever, patient work from United. RVP chests the ball down and Januzaj volleys wide. United have a three v two advantage in the centre. This is a tactical failing we have seen from Pellegrini in the past.
7 mins: Good skill by Navas allows City to move forward, Aguero finds some room in the box and drills a hard shot at De Gea but it was always going to be hard from that angle. Rojo had played him onside...
6 mins: No space on offer for either midfield, Jovetic dropping back to make up the numbers. Congested.
4 mins: Rooney wasteful with the ball. Navas finds a yard of space down the right but his cross is awful. Kiran Kulkarni writes:
The following is a piece from my mail which I sent on 23rd Oct 2011 to Telegraph MBM (Jonathan Liew) when City thrashed United 6-1..
"United deserved this for over-praising and over-relying on the young brigade like Welbeck, Evans and company," writes Kiran Kulkarni. "There is no creativity in midfield. Against top teams Man U will be exposed. Barca will tear them apart. Scholes will be missed dearly. Need a talisman in the middle."
I don't think anything has changed w.r.t. United apart from Moyes episode & some shopping of few expensive individuals..
The main problem still needs to be resolved. The defense & signing a muscular midfielder of Makalele/Toure type..
Smalling, Valencia in defense says it all. It's shame that club of United's stature couldn't find no-nonsense defenders to re-establish the backline during in last three years.
I fancy the repeat of 2011 scoreline unless Pellegrini decides to take things easy due to his own defensive worries..
2 mins: Decent skill from Fellaini as he spins on the ball away from a tackle and frees RVP down the right... Offside again.
1 mins: Demichelis adjudged to have fouled Robin VP when they go up for a header. Di Maria plays it in but Rojo is well offside.
13.29 And it's the Reds who will kick off.
13.28 And here's Man City. Clichy confirmed as the replacement for Kolarov.
13.26 Here's the Man United line-up...
13.24 Clichy will replace Kolarov.
13.23 Hard for me to check this on the hoof but people are saying that United's team is the most expensive in Premier League history.
13.20 Rafael was injured in training. And talking of full-backs, it looks like Kolarov may be limping in the warm up. Well, he is limping I mean. What I mean is, looks like he may be injured and may need replaced.
13.18 Souey on Fellaini. "I think he should be a centre forward. I don't see him long-term as a centre midfielder for United. I just don't think he's got enough football in him."
13.15 The modern blight of the half-and-half scarf:
13.08 Angel Di Maria has said the Spanish equivalent of "the form-book goes out of the window in derbies" on a pre-match interview. How wonderful to be exposed to cliches in other languages.
13.01 "Will Toure take part in the match today? Milner is the one solid player they've got in there." Graeme Souness thinks that some of City's big names have failed to deliver in big games recently.
12.58 City have another major match coming up. Here's some news on that from Mark Ogden:
Manchester City will play in front a sell-out crowd in Wednesday's Champions League clash against CSKA Moscow after offering fans two seats for the price of one.
Manuel Pellegrini's team must beat the Russian champions at the Etihad Stadium in order to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the knock-out stages.
But having failed to fill the ground for the 1-1 draw against AS Roma in September -- only 37,509 fans attended the game -- City have offered the incentive of supporters being able to buy two tickets for the price of one.
CSKA supporters are banned from attending the game due to a Uega sanction imposed following the 'racist behaviour' of fans in Rome in September.
But with City taking the novel approach to selling tickets for the game, the club are now expecting a full house on Wednesday.
12.57 There's David Silva on crutches, that's not good to see. I love watching that little dude.
12.50 Gary Neville is interviewing Noel Gallagher about the match and Man City in general. Leave some jobs for the rest of us, eh our Gary? Noel himself has turned football interviewer in the past, hasn't he? Didn't he interview Mario once? Anywhere, here he is:
"I don't like the hypocrisy of Man United, having a go at City for spending money. As soon as the big bad wolf's out the door it's raining tenners."
He's also told Gary Neville that the sleeve artwork for his new single will be "a little dartboard with your face on it."
12.47 Has Marouane been worf eeet for Man U? Moyesie says aye. You say?
12.45 Pretty good news for Argentine fans, all this. Plenty of their lads on display. Here's Angel Di Maria on the joys and difficulties of playing against your compatriots.Di Maria: City's Argentines are friends, but not today
12.42 Interesting choice to start Jovetic over Dzeko. Anyone got any insight into the thinking behind that?
12.41 So. Who do you fancy then?
12.38 And no Nasri, which is mildly annoying for us cos we had him as the main picture in our blog. Typical. Perhaps his girlfriend Anara Atanes should do some irate tweeting at Manuel P for leaving her guy out of the XI. What an absolute ledge she was. Mind when he didn't make the French WC squad?
"F*** france and f*** deschamps! What a s*** manager!," she tweeted.
And added: "Incase u didnt read my tweet properly.... Ill repeat myself..... f*** FRANCE!!!!! And f*** deschamps!"
12.32 So Rafael not in the match-day squad. Mata dropped to the bench, no massive surprise there.LVG still obliged to pair Smalling and Rojo in central defence.
12.31 And here they are with the subs.
Man City: Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov, Jesus Navas, Toure, Fernando, Milner, Aguero, Jovetic. Subs: Sagna, Nasri, Dzeko, Caballero, Clichy, Fernandinho, Boyata.
Man Utd: De Gea, Valencia, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw, Blind, Fellaini, Januzaj, Di Maria, van Persie, Rooney. Subs: Mata, Lindegaard, Carrick, Ander Herrera, Fletcher, McNair, Wilson.
Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland)
12.30 Here are the teams.
City: Hart, Zabaleta, Kolarov, Demichelis, Kompany, Fernando, Yaya Toure, Navas, Milner, Jovetic, Aguero.
United: De Gea, Valencia, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw, Blind, Fellaini, Januzaj, Rooney, Di Maria, van Persie
12.27 Brave wee Moyesie has popped up to claim that Marouane Fellaini is actually doing great for United and he told you so ner ner ner. Well, that's what one half decent performance will earn you, I guess. Read all about it.
Ahead of today's Manchester derby, Moyes wrote in the Mail: "I’ve watched him in the last two games and he has been first class. He’s had an influence on the games, which is what you look to your bigger players to do. And I think he’s played an important part in helping United gain some momentum going into today’s Manchester derby.
"There were times last season, when things were tough, when we spoke. But I told him then that he would become a top United player if he continued to work hard.
"I’m delighted he’s settled down now and he’s beginning to be appreciated for what he is - a fine footballer who was definitely worth the effort as well as the money."
12.26 Manchester United played Mancehster City - what happened next will shock and amaze you CLICKHERE
12.25 Sorry, that read like one of those weird "One weird trick to get rid of bdy fat..." clickbait come-ons, didn't it?
12.24 Where do you reckon the Manchester derby stands in the pantheon of English football rivalries? Our findings may surprise you...
12.20 Have you had a butcher's at Jonathan Liew's Van Gaal Dossier? It's VG.
12.16 Our Northern Football Correspondent, Mark Ogden, meanwhile says that United are on a hiding to nothing at the Etihad. Agree?
It was once the game that Manchester United never lost, but it has now become the fixture that they cannot win.
When Louis van Gaal’s United travel to Manchester City on Sunday for the 168th Manchester derby, they will make the five-mile journey across town as underdogs - outsiders in a two-horse race that had become an insignificance for the red half of the city.
Despite United’s dramatic late fightback against Chelsea last Sunday and the signs that Van Gaal is beginning to banish the gloom of David Moyes’ disastrous 10-month reign as manager, Sunday offers the true test of United’s progress and the harsh reality is that they are still not ready for the examination they face at the Etihad Stadium.
12.12 Really interesting on the technical side of things, that Neville piece.
With England, I worked under a great coach in Don Howe, who was Terry Venables's defensive expert. He talked to me specifically about my feet and head movements. He would employ physios to lift up different coloured bibs on the opposite side to where the attack was coming. You could see the four defenders synchronizing their head movements. We had to shout the colour of the bib. If you failed, Don would yell: "You're ball watching!"
Don had a strong voice. I remember us conceding a goal against Japan in the Umbro Cup in my first game for England. Terry Venables was telling us how well we youngsters had done when Don cut him off and said: "Whoa, you may be happy, but I'm not. We conceded a goal from a set piece and that's ridiculous. We worked on that in training."
In youth team football I had problems one-on-one with moving my hips. I was quite stiff. United sent me to a mobility coach who worked on my feet movements: how close they needed to be to the ground to increase traction. We were taken into Eric Harrison's office to study the defending of Maldini and Costacurta in the great AC Milan team.
12.06 To my inexpert eye, the problems with Man Utd seem to stem from inadequate personnel at the back. Here though is a very expert eye indeed, Gary Neville, to talk you through the state of modern defending. This is a really excellent piece, well worth a look.
The death of an ex-playing TV pundit is when he continually says: "In my day it was like this - and it was better". I find myself feeling that the Premier League is a far superior place than when I set out in 1992 - but one area of slippage is defending, as Sunday's Manchester derby may illustrate.
Both clubs have amassed a vast array of firepower. Yet each is currently struggling to balance defence with attack at a time of huge change in the way the game is played.
12.04 Manchester United, for their part, could also badly do with at least a point here. They nicked a draw at home to Chelsea last week, celebrating like they'd won the European Cup.
12.00 Hello everyone, and welcome to live blog coverage of this hugely exciting Manc derby. Both teams are in a pickle and both of them desperately need a result today. City haven't won in four matches, held to a draw in Europe that makes them most unlikely to qualify for the next round of the Champions League, well beaten by West Ham in the Prem and then dumped out of the League Cup by Newcastle, who had previously been their bunnies for many a long season. All things considered, Manuel Pellegrini just cannot afford not to win this match.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Samuel Luckhurst - A Mancunian played in the north London derby (Welbeck) and Merseyside derby (Jagielka) yet no Manc is likely to feature in City v United.&lt;/noframe&gt;
Hello and welcome to our minute-by-minute coverage of Manchester City v Manchester United. It's a huge game, with neither team having picked up nearly as many points as they would have liked this season - City are now nine points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, and United 13 points behind.
A few years ago Sir Alex Ferguson made headlines (when didn't he?) by calling City the "noisy neighbours", but this year it seems United have taken on that mantle. Louis van Gaal has been reminding everyone on the eve of this contest that "United are the much bigger club", having spent about £150m in the summer transfer window, but whether they have the better team remains very much in doubt.
In the meantime, here are some more details on the match in our match preview.
Here is an excellent piece by Jim White on how Van Gaal's words mask worries.
And here is what we think the line-ups will be...
Manchester City (Possible, 4-2-3-1): Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Clichy; Touré, Fernando; Navas, Agüero, Nasri; Dzeko.
Man Utd (Possible, 4-2-3-1): De Gea; Rafael, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw; Blind,Carrick; Herrera, Rooney, Di María; Van Persie.
