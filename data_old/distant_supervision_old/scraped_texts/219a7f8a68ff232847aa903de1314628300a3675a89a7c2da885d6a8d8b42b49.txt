The largest margin was in 2013, when (under a new scoring system) 155 points separated Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso and Red Bull's champion Sebastian Vettel.
The most ever wins by a runner-up is 7, by Alain Prost for McLaren in 1984 and 1988, Kimi Räikkönen for McLaren in 2005 and Michael Schumacher for Ferrari in 2006. Two drivers have become runner-up without winning any races – Giuseppe Farina for Ferrari in 1952 and Ronnie Peterson for March in 1971.
Nico Rosberg, driving for Mercedes in 2014, holds the record for the most points scored by a runner-up, with 317 (under a new scoring system). Stirling Moss, driving for Mercedes in 1955, had the least, with 23.
Two drivers have claimed the runner-up spot posthumously – Wolfgang von Trips for Ferrari in 1961 and Ronnie Peterson for Lotus in 1978.
† Von Trips died after a crash at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix; the accident also killed 14 spectators. Peterson similarly died after a crash at the 1978 Italian Grand Prix. These two fatal incidents mark their runner-up statuses in the championship as posthumous awards.
* In 1997, Michael Schumacher initially finished second in the Championship, three points behind Jacques Villeneuve, but was subsequently disqualified from the Championship, as punishment for causing an avoidable accident with Villeneuve at the season's final race.[1]
Below is a list of the drivers that have finished in the second place on multiple occasions. Added are the number of championships that the driver won, if any.
