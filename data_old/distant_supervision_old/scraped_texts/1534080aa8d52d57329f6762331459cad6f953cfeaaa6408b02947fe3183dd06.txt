The following details the inclusion criteria for brain abnormalities and other adverse outcomes potentially related to Zika virus infection during pregnancy. All pregnancy outcomes are monitored, but weekly reporting of adverse outcomes is limited to those meeting the below criteria. All prenatal and postnatal adverse outcomes are reported for both Zika Pregnancy Registries (US Zika Pregnancy Registry, Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System) and Active Birth Defects Surveillance; however, case finding methods dictate some differences in specific case definitions.
Brain abnormalities with and without microcephaly
Neural tube defects and other early brain malformations
Consequences of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction
#Live births: measured head circumference (HC) adjusted for gestational age and sex <3rd percentile at birth, or if not measured at birth, within first 2 weeks of life; pregnancy loss: prenatal HC* more than 3 SD below the mean based on ultrasound or postnatal HC <3rd percentile. Birth measurements based on intergrowth21 standards which are based on measurements within 24 hours of birth, and therefore measurements within 24 hours of birth are appropriate for this assessment.
The US Zika Pregnancy Registry and the Puerto Rico Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System are covered by an assurance of confidentiality. This protection requires us to safeguard the information collected for the pregnant women and infants in the registries.
* Includes microcephaly, calcium deposits in the brain indicating possible brain damage, excess fluid in the brain cavities and surrounding the brain, absent or poorly formed brain structures, abnormal eye development, or other problems resulting from damage to the brain that affects nerves, muscles and bones, such as clubfoot or inflexible joints, and confirmed hearing loss.
**Includes miscarriage, stillbirths, and terminations with evidence of the birth defects mentioned above
