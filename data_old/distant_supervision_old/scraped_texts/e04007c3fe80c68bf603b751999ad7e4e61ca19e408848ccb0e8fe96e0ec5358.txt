if you come for the tourney it's 5 days if you are coming just for your team it will depend. But the point was it's easier getting families to attend a event that is close to a beach or a destination city.
Even then we aren't talking about double or triple but there will be more. B'ham is great if you are a fan with in 4 hours driving time but as I pointed out in another thread. There's a reason the CUSA meetings are in Destain fla. and you can bet the farm those with a family brought the wife and kids. Hold those same meeting in B;ham and those same families stay home.
As to the person that say they paid $10 for a ticket...I'm not going to a conference tourney and standing on the street looking for tickets. Also there are ushers asking to see tickets and even with less than 1000 there trying to make fans move.
ATTALLABLAZE our tourney is a week to 10 days before Spring Break and you can get a decent {better than what I paid $125 for in B;ham) for $80 a night
Here you go a 3 BR condo right on the beach for $250 including taxes and fees ..3 nights March 8th-11th 2017 that's a Wed checking out Saturday
