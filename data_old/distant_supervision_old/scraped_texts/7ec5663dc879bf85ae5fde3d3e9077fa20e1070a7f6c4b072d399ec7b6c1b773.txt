Welcome to the site. My name is John Richardson, author of the book Dream On. I created this website to share everything I’ve learned, and continue to learn, in my journey to break par.
You’ll find a huge amount of golf tips and advice throughout the site and on the blog.
Feel free to leave comments; I love to talk about golf and my goal is to share as much content with you as I can! You don’t have to pay a penny for any of the information in the blog, and I’ve got a 10 video series which you can sign up to free of charge right now. There is also a paid membership area on the site, which goes into detail on the Break Par Blueprint – inside you will find:
Over  30 videos
Text Tooltip
, 12 PDF files, audio commentary and an exclusive member forum.
My intention was to chronicle the challenge in a hopefully entertaining fashion that can be enjoyed by golfers and non golfers alike.
Your information will *never* be shared or sold to a 3rd party
