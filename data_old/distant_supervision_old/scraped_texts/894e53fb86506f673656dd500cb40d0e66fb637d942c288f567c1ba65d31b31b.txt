With three acclaimed awards won back in November, Dextra Group plc. finished 2014 on a high and recognition of our success and achievements has carried through in to 2015.
One of the awards won in November was the Insider Media, Made in the South West award for Advanced Manufacturing.
The award was for the company deemed to be the most forward looking, having consistently used advanced technology or techniques, processes or equipment to solve problems or add value to customers.
South West Business Insider explained why Dextra Group was selected as winners of this award;
“With an investment of more than £4 million over the last 12 months into new technology, Dextra Group wowed the judges with its entry this year. They praised it for being “forward thinking and responsive to its customers
"The lighting manufacturer realised early on just how important investing in research and development and state of the art equipment is in order to be able to adapt and respond to the changing needs of the UK and European marketplace.
"In recent months, Dextra invested in new surface mount technology, creating four production lines with the capacity to place half a million LED chips on cards of up to 900mm x 600mm in a single eight hour shift. Another investment has been in a new Gema powder coating system, which has resulted in increased quality, environmental benefits and minimal wastage.”
All regional winners were put forward to the Made in the UK finals and the awards ceremony for this took place last Thursday bringing together the winners of Insider‘s regional Made in… Awards across nine separate categories and honoured the cream of the UK’s manufacturing industry.
Dextra Group plc. came runner up (highly commended) in the Made in the UK Advanced Manufacturing category against some tough competition, an achievement all at Dextra Group plc. are very proud of.
