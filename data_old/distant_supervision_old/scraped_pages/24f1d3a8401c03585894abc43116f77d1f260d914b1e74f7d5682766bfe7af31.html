        <br></font><br>
      <p><font color="#081180" face="arial" size="+1"> This battle was not at all like the battles that had been fought in the previous month, when there were organized squadrons with a general objective facing the enemy. This battle consisted of several of the bigger warships that had survived the Battle of the Java Sea and now tried to escape the trap before it closed. Unfortunately, none of these ships would succeed and all went down, usually with heavy loss of life. <br>
        <br> The Battle of the Java Sea marked the collapse of Allied seapower in the Dutch East Indies. After the two Dutch cruisers were torpedoed and sunk around midnight the American heavy cruiser Houston and the Australian light cruiser Perth, complying with Admiral Doorman's final order, broke off and fled east making for Tandjungpriok, the port of Batavia. The exhausted crews remained at battle (or action) stations all night, but contrary to expectations, the Java Sea was clear of enemy forces at dawn. Perth, followed by Houston (Captain Waller of the Australian cruiser being senior to Rooks, captain of Houston) made port about noon, but when they tied up at the main dock, the port authorities advised that only 1,000 tons of fuel oil remained and this was being reserved for Dutch ships. After being told that few Dutch ships remained afloat, the authorities permitted Perth to take on 300 tons, bringing her to about 50% of capacity. They determined that Houston had enough fuel to make Australia. The two cruisers were also short on ammunition. Houston had about 50 rounds each for her six operative 8&quot; guns while Perth had only 20 rounds for each of her 6&quot; guns. There was no replenishment available at Tankjungpriok for this critical need. <br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="http://www.warships.net/royalnavy/rnbattles/ww2/perth.jpg"><br><i>HMAS Perth </i></center>
        <br>
        <br> At about 1400 Admiral Helfrich, the Dutch admiral in command of Allied naval forces, ordered the two cruisers to proceed to Tjilatjap on the south coast of Java along with the Dutch destroyer Evertsen. There the Admiral unrealistically hoped to gather the remnants of the ABDA fleet (less the Royal Navy contingent of the Western Strike Force which had been permitted to withdraw to Columbo the day before) and continue the battle. Aerial reconnaissance made as late as 1500 hours on the 28th indicated the western route via the Sunda Strait was clear and that the Japanese invasion fleet was still ten hours steaming time away. <br>
        <br> The Western Strike Force (light cruises Danae, Dragon, Hobart and destroyers Scout, Tenedos and Evertsen) had already navigated the Sunda Strait bound for Ceylon after an unsuccessful sweep of the waters north of Batavia on the night of February 27-28. Only Evertsen returned to Batavia after being separated from her British and Australian companions by a storm. <br>
        <br> The two cruisers cast off at 1900 on the evening of February 28. Evertsen apparently failed to receive orders instructing her to accompany the cruisers; accordingly she was forced to follow about an hour behind. The cruisers cleared the channel and reached the open sea by 1930 and set course west for the straits and, hopefully, safety. <br>
        <br> This was a realistic expectation but for one thing: the intelligence regarding Japanese movements received by Waller and Rooks was faulty. The invasion fleet of 56 transports and a powerful escort that was supposed to arrive off the Straits at approximately 0100 hours on the 1st, several hours after the Allied exit, was actually about four hours ahead of this schedule. <br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="http://www.spruso.com/USS%20Houston%20Stb.Side%201941.jpg"></center>
        <br>
        <br> Japanese scout planes observed the Allied cruisers throughout the day on the 28th so their presence close to the invasion beaches should have come as no surprise; yet, the Japanese dispositions seemed to discount the possibility of opposition. The invasion fleet divided into three groups. Ten transports escorted by light cruiser Yura and the 22nd DD DIV (Satsuki, Minatsuki, Fumitsuki and Nagatsuki) sailed for Ajner Lor west of Sunda Strait. The second group, light cruiser Sendai and the 20th DD DIV (Amagiri, Asagiri and Yugiri) split off and made for Semarang, well east of Batavia in central Java. The main force arrived off St. Nicolaas Point, the extremity of Java marking the entrance to Sunda Strait, on the evening of the 28th. Six transports deployed at Merak on the western side of the Point while 27 transports landed the main body of the 2nd Infantry Division at Bantam Bay east of St. Nicolaas Point. Heavy cruisers Mikuma and Mogami,light cruiser Natori and destroyers Shiratsuyu, Shirakumo, Murakumo, Shirayuki, Hatsuyuki, Asakaze and Shikinami deployed at various points north and west of the landing zones, up to a half hour's steaming time away. Fubuki patrolled the eastern approaches while Harukaze and Hatakaze remained in the bay with the transports along with the 1st minesweeper DIV (W1, W2, W3 and W4). Further north and beyond the battle zone the light carrier Ryujo, the seaplane carrier Chiyoda, the heavy cruisers Kumano and Suzuya and the destroyers Isonami, Shikinami and Uranami provided distant cover. <br>
        <br> At 2215 Fubuki was about 2,500 yards east of Babi Island (13 miles east and slightly north of St. Nicolaas Point) when she sighted strange ships rounding the island to the east. She shaped a course that took her north of the island and then turned to follow these suspected intruders. Conditions favored a battle. The sea was calm, visibility good and the moon full. As the Allied cruisers rounded Babi, Houston, the lead ship, spotted the lights of Point St. Nicolaas marking the path to safety, and then the dark shape of ships maneuvering dead ahead. Forewarned of the possible presence of Dutch patrol boats, Rooks concluded they were moving too quickly to be friendly and sounded the general alarm. Shortly after at 2244, Perth detected Fubuki which had been following behind for almost a half hour and challenged her by blinker. Fubuki replied with a series of green flashes that Perth correctly interpreted as unfriendly whereupon she opened fire. Fubuki turned, made smoke and launched nine type 90 torpedoes from a range of 3,000 yards. The time was 2245. The Allies realized they had unintentionally stumbled onto the main Japanese landing and opened fire on the ships in the bay.<br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="http://www.mediwork.com/navi/giapponesi/mogami.jpg"><br>IJN Mogami<i></i></center>
        <br>
        <br> The rest of the Japanese forces were scattered, mostly to the north and west. Once Fubuki fired her torpedo salvo and withdrew north, only Harukaze and Hatakaze were immediately available to shield the transports and their initial activities were passive in nature. Harukaze got under way at 2231 and covered the entrance to the bay with smoke.<br>
        <br> Hatakaze plunged into this smoke heading north. The Allied cruisers sidestepped Fubuki's torpedoes by making a tight full circle and resumed their course toward the light that marked the entrance to Sunda Strait and, hopefully, escape, shooting at targets they could only imperfectly see. At 2252 Hatakaze began to return fire. For the first fifteen minutes after the first torpedoes were launched, Houston and Perth were the superior force, but at 2300 this position dramatically changed. Shiratsuyu arrived from the northwest and engaged from a position roughly 3,000 to 4,000 yards due north of St.Nichaalos Point. Light cruiser Natori, with Hatsuyuki and Shirayuki opened fire from about 5,000 yards north of the point, charging southwest and rapidly closing range. Asakaze had been cruising north of the point. She joined Hatakaze and Harukaze in a column about 5,000 yards northeast of the point. The heavy cruisers Mikuma, and Mogami followed by Shikinami were still on their way, sailing south were about 10,000 yards north and just east of the point. Finally Shirakumo and Murakumo were steaming hard from the west, but were still 7,000 yards west and north of the point. Houston and Perth were about 5,000 yards directly east of the point and only a few thousand yards northeast of the transports. They turned south, southeast at 2300 under pressure from the increased tempo of Japanese fire and sailed parallel to the transports for about eight minutes inflicting some damage and remaining undamaged themselves. This condition was to rapidly change. <br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="http://www.maxilink.com/benallamuseum/hwaller.gif"><br><i>Captain Hector Waller DSO<br> He was perhaps onr of the Royal Australian Navy's greatest fighting Captains. When the Perth sank, he tried to save as many lives as possible and was last seen in the glare of flames giving orders from the bridge. </i></center>
        <br>
        <br> At 2308 the Allied cruisers turned northeast as they neared Penang Island. The major portion of the Japanese light forces was heading southeast in three columns: Natori, Hatsuyuki and Shirayuki and finally Hatakaze, Asakaze and Harukaze. Between 2310 and 2319 they laced the waters around the cruisers with 28 torpedoes. The Allies replied with everything they had from 8&quot; to .50 c machine guns and, in the case of Perth, even four torpedoes. The nature of the battle from both perspectives was close and confused. Gun flashes seemed to erupt from all quarters while the waters boiled with phosphorescent torpedo wakes. Houston suffered the first damage, a hit on her bridge that started a small fire. Perth remained unscathed despite the constant illumination and heavy fire. Finally, she took three light hits, but remained essentially undamaged. . She returned fire with 6&quot;guns under independent control and the 4&quot; pumping out star shell, damaging Harukaze on her rudder and Shirayuki on her bridge. <br>
        <br> At 2319 the Japanese heavy cruisers finally entered the fray sailing west well off the bay. They fired six torpedoes each at Perth from an estimated distance of about 9,300 yards and then reversed course as they neared Babi Island. At about the same time the Allied cruisers turned back toward the St Nicholaas Point. They were both about out of main battery ammunition and, perhaps, held a final hope of forcing the straits to safety. But this hope grew even fainter at 2322: geysers began to erupt around Houston as the Japanese heavy cruisers opened fire from about 12,000 yards, assisted by the searchlights of their destroyers. Mikuma had to cease fire at 2325 due to a defect in her electric circuits, but was able to resume several minutes later.<br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="http://www.microworks.net/pacific/battles/sunda1.jpg"></center>
        <br><i>Captain Albert H. Rooks, USN, commanding officer of U.S.S. Houston. For his valiant service at the head of his ship until he was slain at midnight on 1st March by shrapnel, Rooks was awarded the Medal of Honor</i><br>
        <br> At 2326 the battle entered its decisive phase. Harukaze and Hatakaze fired five and six torpedoes respectively followed at 2330 by nine each from Shirakumo and Murakumo. Harukaze was probably the agent of the first torpedo to hit Perth. She was making 28 knots when it struck killing all but one of the forward engine crew. . By this time her main batteries were reduced to firing practice shells and her 4&quot; guns star shells. Two more torpedoes, probably from Shirakumo and Murakumo followed at 2335. These hit the forward magazine and aft under X turret. At this point Waller ordered abandon ship, but a fourth torpedo found her before she sank at 2342. Waller went down with his ship. 351 other member of the complement of 686 were lost with their captain. Another 106 crew died as prisoners of war.<br>
        <br> While Perth was engaged by the destroyers, Mogami fired six long lances at Houston at 2327. This was one of the most effective torpedo salvos of the entire war. They sped pass their intended target at 48 knots directly into Bantum Bay. At 2335 five explosions erupted almost simultaneously. The army transports Sakura Maru (7,149 tons gross), Horai Maru (9,162 tons) Tatsuno Maru (6,960 tons) and the special vessel Ryujo (Shinshu) Maru (8,160) tons all sank in shallow water, although the later two were subsequent raised. Mogami also sank minesweeper W2 (807 tons full load displacement) in this barrage, although her loss is also credited to action by Houston and a mine.<br>
        <br> Houston continued the fight alone. Rooks gave up on the idea of escape and turned his ship back toward the transports. At 2340 Houston suffered her first major damage, a hit in her engine room which massacred the entire crew. Her first torpedo hit, again from the salvo fired by Shirakumo and Murakumo followed shortly after. Nonetheless, she fought on. The action was so close and furious a Houston sailor actually shot out a Japanese searchlight with a rifle. The Japanese appeared to have some trouble separating their target from their own ships. Houston benefited as Japanese ships illuminated each other and their own transports and she was able to damage three destroyers. Harukaze, Shirakumo and Shikinami. But the end was inevitable. At 2250 she was hit on her #2 turret, starting a fire; both magazine were flooded. Finally three torpedo hits followed in quick succession. At 2355 Rooks ordered abandon ship. Five minutes later a bursting shell killed the Captain. In all Houston took 4 to 6 torpedoes, three entire salvos, eleven individual hits and additional hits that may have been shells or torpedoes. Every source mentions her flag was flying as she sank, perhaps quoting an account by a crewman: &quot; . . .a sudden breeze picked up the Stars and Stripes still firmly two blocked on the mainmast, and waved them in one last defiant gesture. Then with a tired shudder she vanished beneath the Java Sea.&quot; Only 368 of her crew of 1,061 survived. <br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="http://home.hetnet.nl/~cees6302/foto%27s2/Evertsen_reef.jpg"></center>
        <br>
        <br> On the Japanese side Harukaze was hit by both Houston and Perth suffering 3 KIA and 15 WIA as well as minor damage to her bridge, engine room and rudder . Houston hit Shirakumo. Perth landed a 6&quot; shell on Shirayuki's bridge, inflicting 1 KIA and 11 WIA, Shikinami had minor damage to her prop due to a near miss that reduced her speed to 24 kts. <br>
        <br> The Allied cruisers do not appear to have severely punished the transports, certainly not to the extent Mogami did, but it is hard to believe they didn't inflict some damage during their two relatively close range passes against the anchored transports. The Allied survivors of the battle in particular champion the point of view that the Japanese grossly understated their damage and that as many as 15 ships were sunk. The Ryujo Maru was the flag of the commander in chief of the 16th Army, General Imamura. He was directing the landing of the second wave when the explosion from the torpedo hit threw him into the water. He was three hours struggling ashore, but when his aide finally found him sitting on a pile of bamboo, face blacked with oil, he congratulated the general on his successful landing. Regardless of whether four or fourteen transports were sunk, of the disruption and delay caused by Houston and Perth the aide's congratulations were essentially deserved. Imamura accepted the surrender of Java just eight days after he swam ashore. Any landing that resulted in such a swift and decisive result must be considered successful. <br>
        <br> In an aftermath to the battle the Dutch destroyer Evertsen, originally ordered to accompany Houston and Perth didn't clear Batavia until 2045. Well behind the Allied cruisers (and unsuccessful in her attempts to contact them) she saw the gun flashes from the battle and attempted to detour around it. She made it into the strait, but, at 0130 Murakumo and Shirakumo, vigilance no doubt enhanced by the events of the previous few hours, caught the Dutch ship in their searchlights. They opened fire and rapidly scored seven hits. The Dutch captain didn't appear to fight very enthusiastically, beaching his command on Sebuku Besar. <br>
        <br> Evertsen had only been in commission since December, so her crew as not fully trained, for some reason had only two of her three boilers in operation and she certainly seemed - at best - an unlucky ship. </font><p>

    <center><b>Aftermath</b><center>
   <p>
   <p>The battle of Sunda Strait was an unknown one for most of the war. The crews of the ships were taken prisoner and initially, the allies had no idea what happened to them. Only of the Evertsen was known she was beached, as she signalled it to Helfrich, but of the Perth and Houston, no such signal went out. Only the fact that several years later a Japanese transport with Australian survivors of the Perth was torpedoed, and the Australians rescued, shed some light over what happened to the Perth. There was no account of what happened to Houston at that time.<p>
   <p>The battle of Sunda Strait is one that symbolizes the whole Netherlands East Indies campaign. It was a battle of struggle against a superior enemy and with the same outcome: the destruction of the allies. The Japanese didn't suffer much damage: no ships were sunk except those by own hands: a minesweeper was hit by a torpedo from heavy cruiser Mogami and was blown to pieces, along with a transport ship, the Sakura Maru. Three other transports were damaged by own torpedoes. Again, the Imperial Japanese Navy triumphed over the Allied navies in a battle, but it would be one of her last</center>

    The final act in the slaughter of ABDA occurred off western Java, as the Houston and Perth, fleeing from the debacle in the Java Sea, tried to break out through the Sunda Strait. And as it happened they came upon a Japanese landing force at Bantam Bay, covered by widely dispersed force of cruisers and destroyers. Houston and Perth immediately charged the exposed transports, which were protected at first by the destroyer Fubuki alone. The Allied cruisers were quickly mobbed by the various converging Japanese warships, which fired an unprecedented eighty-seven torpedoes at the two unexpected interlopers. Hit by gunfire and torpedoes, they both were sunk in relatively short order. The Japanese, however, paid the price for their profligate use of torpedoes, because they managed to sink two of their own vessels (a minesweeper and a transport), and severely damaged three more transports with friendly torpedo fire.

       </center> Youngest Soldier Leaves Huge Impact <br>
       <br> By U.S. Army Spc. Casondra Brewster <br> Fort Belvoir, Va., Public Affairs <br>
       <br> FORT BELVOIR, Va. &#151; On Christmas morning in Greene, N.Y., instead of opening gifts, Justin Bryce died. With his death, the Army lost a good soldier. He was a soldier&#146;s soldier. A hero among heroes. And he was only 10 years old.<br>
       <br> &#147;Sgt. Justin,&#148; as his Army family lovingly dubbed him, fought an arduous battle with liver cancer. The cancer spread to his brain, but not before he had fulfilled a life-long desire to become a soldier. <br>
       <br> In early October the Army and the Make-A-Wish Foundation joined forces to help make Justin&#146;s wish come true.<br>
       <br> For just three short days, one of which was spent here at Fort Belvoir, Justin was a soldier. He was enlisted in the Army by top brass at the Pentagon and promoted to sergeant by Sgt. Maj. of the Army Jack Tilley. He was a natural-born leader, assuming the command of a &#147;top-secret mission&#148; which recovered &#147;sensitive and classified&#148; equipment and information. <br>
       <br> &#147;Let&#146;s move out!&#148; he commanded, just moments after being briefed on his mission. And before the day was over, he easily responded with the Army&#146;s traditional, tried-and-true positive answer of &#147;Hooah!&#148; <br>
       <br> During his tour of duty, Justin managed to be awarded a Meritorious Service Medal and collect a couple dozen &#147;challenge coins&#148; from every leader he met. Additionally, he was loaded down with certificates of appreciation and achievement, plaques and other keepsakes from his Army &#147;career.&#148;<br>
       <br> He also took away a piece of heart from everyone who met him that day. He certainly made me blink back a few tears. <br>
       <br> Perhaps more importantly, he made me extra proud to wear &#147;U.S. Army&#148; across my chest. To think that this child could have literally chosen to do anything with his dying wish -- go to Disneyland, take a cruise with his family, or anything else his heart desired. But he wanted to be a &#147;freedom fighter,&#148; he told me when he was here.<br>
       <br> Justin followed in the footsteps of his eldest brother, Army Pfc. Raymond Bryce, who is assigned to Battery E, 7th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Drum, N.Y. <br>
       <br> During their visit to Belvoir, Sgt. Justin&#146;s mom, Mary Bryce, said she wasn&#146;t completely convinced that Raymond&#146;s career choice was the reason Justin chose his Make-A-Wish wish. However, she said she was proud of both of her &#147;soldiers.&#148; &#147;Besides, soldiers get to do cool things, and they get such awesome equipment,&#148; Justin said.<br>
       <br> You know what, Sergeant, you&#146;re absolutely right!<br>
       <br> Sgt. Justin embodied the teaching spirit of any good Army noncommissioned officer, too. He taught me quite a few things during our short tour of duty together. <br>
       <br> Besides giving me that added sense of pride in being a soldier, he taught me that our missions are crucial to the entire nation and that without the Army so many dreams, wishes and desires would never have an opportunity to come true.Sgt. Justin taught me that even the smallest person can have a big impact. He showed me that no matter how awful you feel, you can still smile and carry on. <br>
       <br> He reminded me that life is short, and you need to do what you love to do and be close to those you love. Fortunately, unlike some soldiers during times of battle, Justin died with his family surrounding him. He also will be wearing his custom set of battle dress uniform, identification tags, and highly polished boots to his final resting place.<br>
       <br> Now, because up-state New York resembles a quasi-frozen tundra, little Justin will not be buried until the spring. As his fellow comrade-in-arms, I&#146;d like to go and show an Army family face at his burial. <br>
       <br> However, other missions will probably pull me out of the continental United States before the ground thaws. So, I&#146;d like to invite other members of the Belvoir Army family to stay close to the Bryce situation and show support for Sgt. Justin&#146;s family at his burial this spring. At a minimum, I&#146;d like to invite all of you to send cards, letters or memorial donations. Correspondence for the Bryce family may be sent to: The Bryce Family, P.O. Box 104, Oxford, NY 13830. Justin&#146;s mom can be contacted via e-mail at MaryBryce2002@aol.com .<br>
       <br> Memorial donations can be made to any of the following: Make-A-Wish Foundation of Central New York, Suite 900, Money Tower #2120 Madison St., Syracuse, NY 13202; or Ronald McDonald House of Delaware,1901 Rockland Road, Wilmington, Del., 19803.<br>
       <br> Other memorial requests can be found on Justin&#146;s Web site at www.caringbridge.org/ny/justinbryce/index.htm. Currently, there&#146;s a posting on the Web site that says Justin has earned his &#147;Angel Wings.&#148; I say he earned them a long time ago. When Taps plays tonight, I&#146;ll be thinking of little-but-strong and big-hearted Sgt. Justin Bryce. <br>

    <center><b>Flags crown memorial to sunken ship <br> Monument honors USS Houston crew </b></center>
 <p> By LISA M. CHMIOLA<br> 1997 Houston Chronicle<p> Five American flags flew high over Sam Houston Park in downtown Saturday, signaling the completion of the USS Houston memorial. <p> The $38,000 addition of red granite pavement and flagpoles surrounding the 15-foot-tall monument completed the memorial, which honors the 1,065-man crew aboard the Houston when it was sunk by the Japanese March 1, 1942. <p> &quot;The monument represents a place for (the survivors) to come and be with their families,&quot; said retired Navy Capt. Carl Ragsdale, chairman of the USS Houston Foundation. <p> The foundation is a voluntary 10-person committee of Texas Commandery of the Naval Order of the United States members and was responsible for seeing the memorial project to its completion. <p> About 102 of the Houston's 368 survivors are still alive. When sunk, the ship was attempting to slip through the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. <p> Survivors of the Houston were held as Japanese prisoners &quot;in forced labor, without medicine or care (and) near starvation,&quot; Ragsdale said. <p> Saturday's completion ceremony consisted of a short prayer for members of the Houston crew. <p> The monument, dedicated Nov. 11, 1995, is also a place for families to honor loved ones lost when the Houston sunk, said retired Navy Capt. Carter Conlin, a foundation member who was responsible for writing the historical information about the Houston appearing on the monument. <p> Fellow member retired Navy Capt. Rodney Koenig said, &quot;It's a very visible monument to a very brave group of people.&quot; <p> The monument is not only important for survivors and families to visit, but also for hundreds of Houston-area schoolchildren, since children were instrumental in raising funds to construct the Houston's replacement ship, Ragsdale said. <p> Eventually, four of the five American flags will be replaced with flags honoring those from Texas, Australia, Britain and the Netherlands &quot;who fought with the USS Houston crew,&quot; Ragsdale said.

    You're dating yourself buddy.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>That Was The Week That Was (popularly known as TW3, and occasionally as TWTWTW) was a program of topical satire expressed through one-liners, skits, songs, etc. The show aired in the United States on the NBC television network, beginning with a one-hour special in late 1963. The program was picked up as a midseason replacement in the 1963-64 season and ran through the 1964-65 season.&#13;<br><a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/achimes/tw3.htm&#13;">http://pages.prodigy.net/achimes/tw3.htm&#13;</a><br>&#13;<br>

    <img src="http://aomagrat.home.att.net/images/Illinois.jpg"><p>Today's classic warship, USS Illinois (BB-7)<p>Illinois class battleship<br> Displacement. 11,565<br> Length. 368'<br> Beam. 72'3&quot;<br> Draft. 23'6&quot;<br> Complement. 660<br> Speed. 17 k.<br> Armament. 4 13&quot;, 14 6&quot;, 16 6-pdr., 6 1-pdr., 4 tt.<p> USS Illinois (BB-7) was laid down 10 February 1897. by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Va., launched 4 October 1898; sponsored by Miss Nancy Leiter; and commissioned 16 September 1901, Captain G. A. Converse in command. <p> After shakedown and training in Chesapeake Bay, the new battleship sailed 20 November 1901 for Algiers, La., where she was used to test a new floating dry dock. She returned to Newport News in January 1902 and from 15 to 28 February Illinois served as flagship for Rear Admiral R. D. Evans during the reception for Prince Henry of Prussia. Bearing the flag of Rear Admiral A. S. Crowninshield, the battleship departed New York 30 April 1902 and arrived Naples 18 May, where the Admiral took co mmand of the European Squadron. Illinois carried out training and ceremonial duties until 14 July 1902, when she grounded in the harbor of Christiana, Norway, and had to return to England for repairs. She remained at Chatham until 1 September 1902, then proceeded to the Mediterranean and South Atlantic for fleet maneuvers. <p> Illinois was detached from the European Squadron 10 January 1903 and assigned to the North Atlantic. She engaged in fleet maneuvers, gunnery and seamanship training, and ceremonial operations until December 1907, when she joined the Great White Fleet for the cruise around the world. Following a Presidential review, the mighty battleships sailed from Hampton Roads on their important voyage. The Atlantic Fleet joined the Pacific Fleet 8 May 1908 in San Francisco Bay and after a review by the Secretary of the Navy the combined fleets continued their cruise. The ships visited Australia, Japan, Ceylon and other countries, arriving Suez 3 January 1909. At Suez word of the Sicilian earthquake sent Illinois, Connecticut, and Culoga to Messina. After rendering valuable aid to victims of the disaster, the ships rejoined the fleet, returning to Hampton Roads 22 February 1909. President Roosevelt reviewed the fleet as it arrived, having given the world a graphic demonst ration of America's naval might. Illinois decommissioned at Boston 4 August 1909. <p> The battleship was placed in reserve commission 15 April 1912 and recommissioned 2 November 1912, in time to take part in winter fleet exercises and battle maneuvers with the Atlantic Fleet. During the summers of 1913 and 1914 Illinois made training cruises to Europe with Midshipmen. In 1919 the ship was again laid up at Philadelphia Navy Yard and was later loaned to the State of New York 23 October 1921 for use by the Naval Militia. <p> Excluded from further use as a warship by the terms of the Washington treaty, Illinois was fitted out as a floating armory at New York Navy Yard in 1924 and was assigned to the New York Naval Reserve. She remained there for more than 30 years, though reclassified IX-15 8 January 1941 and renamed Prairie State to allow her name to be assigned to a projected new battleship. During World War II she served as a U. S. Naval Reserve Midshipmen Training School at New York. Following the war, she was retained on loan to the State as quarters for a Naval Reserve unit until 31 December 1956. <p> Prairie State, after over 50 years of useful service to the Navy and the Nation, was towed to Baltimore and sold for scrap to Bethlehem Steel Co., 18 May 1956.

    <img src="http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h93000/h93157.jpg"><p>Albert Harold Rooks was born in Colton, Washington, on 29 December 1891. He entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1910 and was commissioned in the rank of ensign upon graduation in June 1914. During the next seven years, among them the First World War years of 1917-18, he served in several ships and commanded the submarines A-5, F-2 and H-4. In 1921, Lieutenant Rooks joined the staff of the Twelfth Naval District, at San Francisco, California, remaining there until 1925, the year he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. He next spent three years on board the battleship New Mexico, followed by duty at the U.S. Naval Academy. In 1930, he helped commission the new cruiser Northampton and served in her until 1933, when he returned to the Naval Academy for a second tour. <p> In February 1936 Commander Rooks placed the new destroyer Phelps in commission and remained as her Commanding Officer until 1938. His next assignment was as a student at the Naval War College, and, upon completion of his studies, he served on that institution's staff. He was promoted to the rank of Captain in June 1940, while still at the War College. In 1941 Rooks took command of the heavy cruiser Houston (CA-30), flagship of the Asiatic Fleet. He took his ship through the painfully difficult first three months of the Pacific War, when the Asiatic Fleet and its British and Dutch counterparts fought desperately against an overwhelming Japanese onslaught into Southeast Asia, the Philippines and the East Indies. Both Houston and her gallant Commanding Officer were lost in the Battle of Sunda Strait, on 28 February - 1 March 1942. For his courage and professionalism during the Netherlands East Indies Campaign, Captain Rooks was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. <p> The destroyer USS Rooks (DD-804), 1944-1962, was named in honor of Captain Rooks.

<div class="b2">
    Saturday 28th February 1942, following the mauling of the previous night's Java Sea battle, Captain 'Hec' Waller, RAN, had no hesitation in withdrawing to the prearranged rendezvous at Tandjeong Priok (Indonesia). &#13;<br>&#13;<br>He was now in command of the last remaining ships. He had one undamaged 6&quot; cruiser and one 8&quot; cruiser, USS HOUSTON, with no guns aft and its ammunition seriously depleted. Day and night they had been constantly shadowed by Jap aircraft. He could only guess at the opposing forces, but thought at least six cruisers and possibly twelve destroyers and also submarines. In fact there was to be considerably more.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Perth's Ship's Company new that there were large Japanese forces north of Java closing in on them as they sailed that afternoon from Tandjeong Priok in company with Houston.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Both ships were critically short ammunition for their main armament and also fuel oil. The Sunda Strait was deemed to be clear of enemy shipping therefore it looked to Captain 'Hec' Waller that he could force his way through to the Indian Ocean before the Japs closed the door.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>The night sky was clear with a large moon and the sea like glass, visibility was 6 - 7 miles. At 2306 a vessel was sighted and challenged, it replied strangely and turned away making smoke, it was a Jap destroyer and unknown to Perth had launched nine torpedoes.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Perth opened fire immediately and altered course to bring all guns to bear. More destroyers were sighted northward, then one cruiser and five destroyers. Reports indicated that the first destroyer was sunk but the fight had only just begun.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Destroyers engaged from all directions and it was difficult to judge just how many enemy opposed them. It was soon evident that the odds were overwhelming. In fact they had run into the entire Japanese invasion fleet, consisting of at least two heavy cruisers, a light cruiser with ten destroyers. Also closing from the north were four heavy cruisers, an aircraft carrier and more destroyers. Perth's four 6&quot; turrets went to independent control in a frantic attempt to engage as many of the enemy as possible that surrounded her. The 4&quot; pounded out star shell in an effort to illuminate the enemy. The action was point blank.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>The Jap destroyers pressed the attack and managed to illuminate Perth at close range with their searchlights. Shellfire was heavy, the sea around her seemed to be boiling. Houston was hit first and was set afire in the bridge area, her main (8&quot;) armament ceased to fire, perhaps her ammunition already expended. Her lighter guns continued to engage, the tracer spitting out horizontally telling all that it was at very close range.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Perth remained unscathed and she launched her torpedoes into the congested sea, multiple hits were observed, and she was taking a toll on the enemy. In an attempt to cover Houston's defenceless stern she started taking hits, by midnight the 6&quot; ammo was all but gone.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Captain Waller made a bid to force a passage through Sunda Straight, two cruisers and two destroyer flotillas barred the way. With the ship making 28 knots the first torpedo struck. In one hour eighty seven torpedoes had been launched at Perth and Houston and now the first hit Perth.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Perth took a mighty blow below the water line, wiping out, apart from one, the entire forward engine room crew. Both the forward 4&quot; mountings were wiped out to a man.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>The remaining 4&quot; guns, now out of H.E. ammunition, continued to engage with starshell and nonexplosive practice ammo. The few remaining 6&quot; rounds were fired. Their luck had been incredible to last this long. Another torpedo hit the forward magazine, although empty, the damage spelt the end for her, it jammed the hatches shut trapping the men inside the magazine and causing considerable casualties. Then came the order to &quot;Abandon Ship!&quot; A great roar erupted as a third torpedo struck, from under 'X' turret a huge geyser of water erupted, the ship gave a violent, nervous twitch. Against the ice-white light a mass of figures shot into the air, spinning over like acrobats and rag dolls, some fell into the sea others back on board, some alive, some dead. The shock waves of the explosions killing all those immersed in the water within a certain radius, crushing their insides.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>The glare of the searchlights was constant first from one ship then another, she was encircled now. From bow to quarter she was pulverized, with shells continuing to rain down upon her, causing great carnage. A fourth torpedo struck.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Captain Waller continued on at half speed in an effort to stop the ship taking more men with her when she finally went. Then her bows dipped gently down, her stern raised out out the water, only one of her four screws still turning. It was said she did not sink but 'steamed out'. Her much loved Captain last seen in the glare of the flames, on the bridge, giving orders.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Houston, after a similarly heroic performance also went down. Perth's total complement was 681. Of these 353 were lost in action, 4 died ashore and 324 were captured, of these 106 died whilst prisoners of war 53 of them on the infamous Burma-Siam railway.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>In all the Japanese had lost fifteen ships and could not believe that a Battleship was not present. A report in the Syonan Times in Japan in 1942 read - In the terrific battle in Sunda Strait many ships on both sides were sunk. It must be remembered, however, that the lighter Nipponese ships were fighting a superior force which included a battleship&quot;.The Japan Times made a similar admission. &#13;<br>&#13;<br> &#13;
