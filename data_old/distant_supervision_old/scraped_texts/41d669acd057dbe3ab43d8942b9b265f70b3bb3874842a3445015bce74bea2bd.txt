Attach To Process Debugging HoloLens now supports attach-to-process debugging. You can use Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 to connect to a running app on a HoloLens and start debugging it. This works without the need to deploy from a Visual Studio project.
Updated HoloLens Emulator We've also released an updated version of the HoloLens Emulator.
Gamepad Support You can now pair and use Bluetooth gamepads with HoloLens! The newly released Xbox Wireless Controller S features Bluetooth capabilities and can be used to play your favorite gamepad-enabled games and apps. A controller update must be applied before you can connect the Xbox Wireless Controller S with HoloLens. The Xbox Wireless Controller S is supported by XInput and Windows.Gaming.Input APIs. Additional models of Bluetooth controllers may be accessed through the Windows.Gaming.Input API.
We are in sync with the rest of the Windows 10 Anniversary update, so in addition to the Hololens specific fixes, you are also receiving all the goodness from the Windows update to increase platform reliability and performance.
