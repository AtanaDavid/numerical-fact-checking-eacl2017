The Grand Sports Arena of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex (briefly Luzhniki Stadium) is the biggest sports stadium in Russia. Its field is used mainly for dome football games by Torpedo Moscow club, who also owns the sports complex, and Spartak Moscow. It is one of the few major European stadiums to use an artificial pitch, as it installed a FIFA-approved Field Turf pitch in 2002. The pitch is necessary for the cold Russian climate, as regular grass pitches are often destroyed during the winter. However, a temporary natural grass pitch was installed for hosting the 2008 Champions League Final.           The Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium was the main venue for the 1980 Summer Olympics, the spectator capacity being 103,000 at that time. The events hosted during the Olympics in this stadium were the Opening and Closing ceremonies, Athletics, Football finals, and the Individual Jumping Grand Prix. The arena also hosted the final game of the 1957 Ice Hockey World Championship between Sweden and the Soviet Union. The attendance was of 55,000 and set a new world record at that time. On October 20, 1982, disaster struck during the UEFA Cup match between FC Spartak Moscow and HFC Haarlem and the official number of deaths is 66.            The stadium hosted many other events such as concerts (as Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Ozzy Osbourne, Skid Row, M�tley Cr�e, Cinderella and Michael Jackson) and athletic competitions.
