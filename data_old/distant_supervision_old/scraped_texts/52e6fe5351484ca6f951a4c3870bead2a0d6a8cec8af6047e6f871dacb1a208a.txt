Farmers Weekly Awards celebrate the very best of British farming by recognising and rewarding innovation, hard work and passion for agriculture.
The Awards, now in their 12th year, provide an opportunity to showcase the best farmers in the country by telling their stories.
The theme for this year, “working together, stronger together”, aims to highlight collaboration between farmers and the industry to spread best practice and inspire others.
The Farmers Weekly Awards Night has become the night in the farming social calendar.
There are fifteen categories spanning the full breadth of the farming industry; from contractor to farm adviser; sheep to arable and diversification to dairy.
