Top three finishers in each division qualify for the playoffs. The winner of the playoff between the second and third place teams will play the first place team for the division title.
In the Eastern Conference, the playoff format will be the one used in the former MISL. Each round will be a home and home series. Teams that win both games will advance. If the wins are split between the two teams, a fifteen-minute mini game will be played immediately after the second game to break the tie. In the Western Conference, the playoff format will be single elimination, which was used in the former PASL. The Ron Newman Cup final will use the home and home (MISL) format, including a mini game to break the tie. [9][10]
