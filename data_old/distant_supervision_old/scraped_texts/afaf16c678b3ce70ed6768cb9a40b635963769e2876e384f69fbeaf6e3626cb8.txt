As bad as we've been over recent years (2004-05 very much excepted), Everton have actually had manymore seasons to be proud of than reasons to despair.
Remember 1969-70?  Superb.  1984-85?  Unbelievable. There have of course been spectacularly bad seasons though. Relegation in 1950-51.  The near misses in 1993-94 and 1997-98.
