We are a family run business dedicated to creating events that utilize the remote gravel and dirt  roads of Arizona to offer adventurous yet achievable challenges for a wide range of cyclists. Events that encourage and support people to get out and ride their bikes.
If you're interested in the  Bradshaw Grinder or the Chino Grinder or just linking in with other gravel enthusiasts in the SouthWest, please like our Facebook or join the Riding AZ Gravel Facebook group.
