                        Kings Hammer SC presents the 2nd annual 4v4 Futsal Turkeyfest on November 25-26, 2016 (Black Friday).  Saturday, November 26 will be used if a second day is needed.

What better way to spend your holiday weekend than having your teams participate in a futsal event for a great cause.  Not only will this be a good winter warmup, but it will be a wonderful opportunity to support a local charity.  Kings Hammer will once again be collecting toys and canned goods at this event that will be donated to a local charity. Last year we donated over 250 canned goods and non-perishable food items along with 50 toys to Be Concerned, a local charity that supports low income families located in Covington, KY.

In addition, the $175 entry fee gives your team access to TWO 4v4 Futsal events.  When you sign up for the 4v4 Futsal Turkeyfest your team will automatically be registered for the 4v4 Futsal Freeze on January 15-16, 2017 (MLK Day)!  What a great opportunity for your players to support a local cause and participate in two 4v4 Futsal events.  

The 4v4 format allows for a fun and competitive day of fast paced futsal. Played on a small sized court without goalies, teams work on spacing, passing, defensive positioning and footwork flair. For the moms, dads, grandparents or whoever else drives that day, we want to make it convenient. You will be in and out in a matter of hours allowing for additional time spent with your family.

Every player will receive a Bag Tag for participating. Champions and finalists in each age division will receive medals.

                        The Charlotte Moran Memorial Fund, a 501c3 organization, has been established to honor the legacy of long-time women’s soccer advocate, Charlotte Moran, who lost her battle to pancreatic cancer in May 2009 after heroically battling the disease for nearly two years.  

Charlotte had been involved in soccer for more than 20 years, beginning at the grassroots level as a team manager through roles at regional and national levels.  In addition to her leadership roles as the state level, she also served as the US Youth Soccer Olympic Development Program Girls Region I Administrator for a number of years as well as the US Youth Soccer Olympic Development Program National ODP Girls Chair.

This event honors the memory and legacy of Charlotte!

                        Many think of furniture design and architecture when they think of Danish lifestyle and culture. Yet today, Denmark is perhaps equally famous for food, films and sports. The world&#39;s best restaurant &quot;Noma&quot; has introduced a whole new way of cooking with New Nordic Cuisine.

Denmark is one of the world&#39;s oldest monarchies with a history that stretches back to the Viking Age around the year 1000. Danish society rests on the foundation of the Danish Constitution of 1849, and the political system has since been characterised by broad solutions across the political divide. Denmark is often cited as one of the world&#39;s best countries to live in. The strong welfare state ensures economic equality in society and the virtual non-existence of corruption, while polls repeatedly show that the Danes are among the happiest people in the world.
