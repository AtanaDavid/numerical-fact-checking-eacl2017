LAST TIME OUT
Wake Forest struggled to an eighth-place finish at the 1999 Atlantic Coast
Conference Golf Championships last weekend, held at the Old North State
Club in Badin Lake, NC.  The Demon Deacons carded a team score of
300-305-303=908 (+44) to finish 45 strokes behind team champion Georgia
Tech, who recorded a 54-hole score of 863 (-1).  Duke's Matt Krauss shot a
4-under 212 to claim the ACC individual title, becoming the first freshman
to do so since Jason Widener in 1990.  Seniors Michael Capone and Oscar
Sanchez both placed in the top 20 with relatively consistent play.  Capone
shot 74-71-75 to finish tied for 12th at 4-over, while Sanchez came in one
stroke higher in 17th place, shooting 74-72-75.  Junior Jamie Gallacher
(+17) placed 36th after carding 77-82-74, while seniors Juan Vizcaya
(75-82-79) and Thomas Parker (78-80-79) placed 40th and 42nd at 20- and
21-over, respectively.
HEAD COACH JERRY HAAS
Jerry Haas is in his second season as head coach of the Demon Deacons,
after having taken the reins of the Wake Forest program in September of
1997.  A 1985 graduate of WFU and a four-time collegiate All-American, Haas
played nine years of professional golf, including four years on the PGA
Tour, before returning to his alma mater as a head coach.
