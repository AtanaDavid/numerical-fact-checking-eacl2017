Steve Clark: “The perFORM house attempts to resolve the design problem by reconciling two intrinsically differing environmental strategies. It is at once a thermally resistive, highly-insulated, thick-walled box, while also being a highly-transparent glass house to ensure pleasant views and daylighting. On the surface these two strategies seem diametrically opposed, but by blending both strategies, the strengths of each are realized.
Consideration was given to balancing construction cost with thermal performance and beauty. The entire residence is composed on a 4’x4’ grid, minimizing material waste in construction and providing an versatile framework on which spaces are composed…”
