Nobody’s given us a chance. Loads of people were saying we couldn’t get a point. We weren’t at it against Poland but tonight was a lot better. We’re delighted for everyone and these supporters. It’ll sink in over the next few days, but the team performance was pleasing tonight. We’ve got a tough game to look forward to, but we’ve got something to play for and that’s what we wanted. We let ourselves down against Poland but we put it right.
You know, it’s pleasing. It’s good. Tough game ahead, but we’re delighted. The lads will take confidence in it, because we’ve been written off, really.
