Burnley continue to head away from the danger zone but there's just no out ball for them at the moment.
Arsenal corner, queueing up to get the ball in the penalty box. And then over from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
And goal! From the resulting corner. How has that gone in?
Walcott nods the ball on from the corner, Alex Oxlade Chamberlain and Laurent Koscielny are waiting at the far post. The former knees the ball into the Frenchman, whose hands are up, and it trickles over the line.
A hint of both hand ball and offside against Koscielny but Arsenal have nicked it here!
