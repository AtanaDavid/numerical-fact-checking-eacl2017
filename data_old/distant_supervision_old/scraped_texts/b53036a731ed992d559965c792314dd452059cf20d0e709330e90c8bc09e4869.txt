Official Review by Richard Smith, Stadium Journey Regional Correspondent
From 1991 to 2003, the original Harrisburg Heat played indoor soccer as part of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), which would later became one of many versions of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). The team gave the well-established Baltimore Blast a local rivalry, as Harrisburg is less than two hours down I-83 from �Charm City.�
The Heat began just as the Hershey Impact imploded, leaving a sports void for indoor soccer in central Pennsylvania. Although always competitive in the NPSL and MISL, the Heat only made it to the sport�s finals in 1994-95, losing to the St. Louis Ambush.
Finally in 2012, a new version of the Harrisburg Heat began as an expansion team of the Professional Arena Soccer League (PASL). Rather than playing in the Large Arena at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center, as the old Heat did, the new Heat played their games at 2,500-seat Equine Arena, located just down the hall in the same complex.
In 2014, the PASL and the most successful teams of the MISL (including the Heat�s old rival, the Baltimore Blast) merged into a new entity called the Major Arena Soccer League (MASL). With this �new� league came a move back to the Large Arena. The team had actually contemplated a move to the larger venue during a potential playoff run in 2013/2014, which did not occur.
The Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center is obviously home to the Pennsylvania Farm Show. That show, held during the second week in January, is considered the largest indoor agricultural event held in the United States. The complex is all indoors and includes eleven buildings, including one other arena (Sale Arena) besides the Large and Equine Arena.
The finals of the First Frontier Circuit Rodeo are also held annually at the Large Arena during the Farm Show event. That event is the end of the regional rodeo circuit for the upper northeast part of the United States.
Former professional sports teams that also played here have been the Harrisburg Hammerheads of the Continental Basketball Association and the Harrisburg Stampede of the Professional Indoor Football League.
The FANFARE scale is our metric device for rating each stadium experience. It covers the following:
Each area is rated from 0 to 5 stars with 5 being the best. The overall composite score is the "FANFARE Score".
There are a few concession stands around the arena, but you will find only a couple open for Harrisburg Heat games. The options are small and standard for arenas. You won't be wowed by the choices, but the prices and quality are decent.
Hot dogs are $3, cheeseburgers $6, Italian sausage $6, grilled chicken sandwiches $6 and chicken tenders and fries for $7.  Sodas are $3.25 and $4.25, with bottled water $3. Other options vary, but usually include french fries for $3.25, potato chips $2 and brownies for $2.75.
Beer is sold at a small kiosk for $5.75.
The Large Arena is just that, large. Although it holds only 7,318 seats, the venue is very spacious, with a tall roof and a large floor area. The floor is designed for equestrian and rodeo-type events so there is plenty of space around the soccer field.
Seating is steep. The design of the building is very old-school, with steep seating areas. It reminds me in many ways of the Hersheypark Arena, built just three years prior to the Large Arena, in nearby Hershey, Pennsylvania.
The concourse of the arena is much larger than usually seen of venues of this age. There is plenty of room for even the largest of crowds to wander around. The unique thing is that you will likely come into the arena through the east entrance, but the open concession stands are located on the west side of the arena.
There is a mascot named Scorch that moves around the stands trying to keep fans engaged. Music is also played between game action, as well as during many parts of the game itself.
There really isn't a lot in the immediate vicinity of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex. A Popeye's Chicken and a Burger King are the closest options, located just a block south on Cameron Street.
The Staybridge Suites Harrisburg Hershey (920 Wildwood Park Drive) is the closest lodging option, as it is located almost in the parking lot of the complex.
If coming from downtown, there are many options there to grab a bite before the game. 2nd Street has many places to visit as part of its restaurant row. The best deal may be Anthony's Micro Pub & Pizza (225 N 2nd Street) which has a large selection of craft brews and a great happy hour special with half off from 4pm to 6pm. And on Fridays and Saturdays the special also includes free pizza.
The Heat is in the process of rebuilding their fan base after being away for nearly 10 years. They still obviously have a ways to go in that regard. But the fans who attend are treated to an experience that will remind them of the glory days of the Harrisburg Heat. People who have attended other indoor soccer games, such as in Baltimore, will recognize the traditions on display here.
That said, attendance has been minimal, although in fairness, I attended near the end of what has been a brutal first season in the MASL. So there is plenty of room for optimism.
The Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex is easy to get to. From I-81 north, go to US-22 east (exit 67A). Proceed to the exit for PA-230 east (Cameron Street). Exit onto Cameron Street, and the complex will be on the right.
There is plenty of parking, even when some other big events are being held simultaneously.
Ticket prices range from $12 for behind the goals and in the upper sections to $20 for VIP tickets right along the sideline. $15 corner seats and $18 sideline seats may be the best value.
There are also many events and specials to be found during the season, so be on the lookout for those kind of options. Being a member of a group may also bring you special ticket values. The team is active on social media, so one should keep a lookout there for options.
Parking is controlled by the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and is $8 per car. Depending on other events being held at the same time, parking can either be easy to find or much more difficult. Check the website for the complex ahead of time so that you are aware of the situation.
The prices are good, but not a spectacular value.
If you are able to wander around the rest of the complex, you will find a truly unique indoor set of venues. Imagine a state fair, but indoors. That is how to describe the Pennsylvania Farm Show event. Seeing how these buildings fit together is pretty interesting.
If you are able to get into the Equine Arena, take a peek at where the "new" version of the Harrisburg Heat played for a couple of seasons. This arena is one of the newer parts of this historic complex, so it offers an interesting contrast to the overall venue.
The Large Arena has some pretty interesting sights on its own. The large round collections of light that overhang the field is a pretty interesting design. The upper sections seats are also pretty uniquely situated, although they may make some pretty lousy seating for a larger event.
The Harrisburg Heat are still getting their feet wet again. They offer a good event value, and hopefully the fans will return to see them play.
