What does the future look like? Are cities built in the clouds? Is it a place where
everyone gets along - even cats and dogs? Or maybe a world where nobody ever gets
sick? With the Google homepage as their canvas, young artists are invited to reach
into their imagination and share what they see for the future. The winnerâ€™s artwork
will be featured on the Google homepage.
