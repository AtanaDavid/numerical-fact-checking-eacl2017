One of our stated aims is “to provide a grammar school education to pupils” (day and boarding for boys aged 11-18 and day for girls aged 16-18). As a state school, educational tuition is free to all pupils with boarders paying only for the provision associated with boarding.
The majority of pupils join Adams’ in Year 7 (aged 11+) although, if space permits, we will also accept pupils into Year 8 and 9 after examination (day and boarding). We also have a large sixth form and welcome applications from both boys and girls (please refer to our Sixth Form section for more information).
Parents have the right to apply to Adams’ Grammar School irrespective of their address in the United Kingdom. Day places at 11+ entry are awarded on a merit basis according to results in our entrance examination. Boarding places are awarded on a merit basis according to results in the examination as well as suitability for boarding and boarding need. Only holders of UK or EU passports or with right of abode in the UK are entitled to apply for a place at Adams’ Grammar School.
