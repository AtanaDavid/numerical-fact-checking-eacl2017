- 

For Protest 



A standing-room-only audience of about 40 
neighbors' crowded into the Antioch Village 
Board meeting Monday night, to protest 
against a proposed rezoning to multiple units 
for a project on Anita St. 

On arrival they: learned this proposal was 
not even on the agenda because it had not yet 
been heard and forwarded by the planning 
commission. It had been rescheduled for 
public hearing at the commission meeting 
Thursday, Feb. 19, at 7:30 p.m. in the village 
hall. 

The village board accepted and placed on 
file their petition objecting to the rezoning. It 
was signed by one neighbor from Kinear Rd.

Board members also apologized that many 
members of the audience had to stand even 
after extra chairs were brought in. , They 
promised that the new larger meeting room 
would be in use by the next board meeting. 

In response to a question from v the 
audience, Kenneth Clark, village attorney, 
checked the ordinance book regarding such 
petitions. He said that if the owners of 20 
percent of the footage fronting on any one 
side petition to object to a rezoning request, a 
two-thirds vote by the trustees is required to 
approve it. 

Clark added that this rule does not apply to ; 
the planning commission, whose hearing the 
neighbors . were talking of attending. He 
pointed out that this also would have applied 
to the zoning board action, but their hearing 
already, had been held before the petition was 
submitted. 

Vera Burdick, a member of the zoning 
board, said he was at. the village- board 
meeting ''as a citizen." After extensive 
discussion . back and forth between the 
audience and board members, 'however, 
Burdick commented, "We had an open 
hearing at the. zoning board and no opposition 
appeared. ..You people should hove been 
there then." 

Village officials pointed out that the zoning 
board had held a public hearing. AH 
property owners adjoining the rezoning area 
and within 200 feet were notified in advance 
of that hearing.

Continue to Rise 



by RUTH SUTTON 

The Illinois Environmental Protection 
Agency (IEPA) has asked the Illinois - 
Pollution Control Board (IPCS') to dismiss a 
petition by Hillview Farms Fertilizers, Inc., 
for review of its permit appeal. 

The IEPA listed several reasons for 
recommending dismissal in a post hearing 
memorandum submitted by Stephen C, 
Ewart, senior attorney. In it he says, 
"During this proceeding, 1,900 pages of 
records were organized by this agency and 
submitted prior to seven hearing dates, 
which hearings generated 1,602 pages of 
transcript. However, at the conclusion of this 
proceeding, having heard from petitioner's 
nationally-known experts, respondent 
(IEPA) maintains that petitioner (Hillview) 
has failed to provide an accurate account of 
how many injectable acres Hillview has to 
apply the existing level or the proposed in- 
creased level of sludge consistent 
with.. .water pollution regulations of the 
board and the environmental protection 

act." ■ 

The IEPA memorandum states that 

Hillview's petition should be dismissed, first, 

because of a precedent in which the board 

found it had no authority to decide a petition 

\ 



for review while a permit application is 
pending. The review petition is dated Jan. 31, 
1986, and the permit application Jan 22, 1986. 

Second, the IEPA brief states that 
"Hillview's stipulation endorsing the 
agency's denial of additional waste storage 
conceded the correctness of the agency's 
determination that the permit, if granted^ 
would violate board rules and the act." 

Third, the IEPA claims, 'it is petitioner's 
burden to show on appeal that its prospective 
activities as evidenced in the record before 
the agency at the time of its decision will not 
violate the act or regulations adopted pur- 
(Contimii'donPagc 1-1) 



Reschedule 
Board Meeting 

The regular board meeting of Emmons 

School Dist. 33, Antioch will be held on 

Monday, March 16, at 8 p.m. at Emmons 

School rather than the usual date, which 
would be Monday, March 9.

Girl Scout 
Expo At 

Lakehurst 

Girl Scouts from 53 
communities in the Illinois 
Prarie Girl Scout Council 
will present their annual 
Expo on Saturday, Feb. 21. 
The 1987 exhibition 
celebrates the 75th An- 
niversary of Girl Scouts of 
theU.S.A. 

Over 2,000 Girl Scouts and 
their leaders are displaying 
projects in health and safety, 
technology, community 
service, puppetry, en- 
vironmental awareness and 
recreational activities. 

The all day panorama 
begins at .10 a.m.* at 
Lakehurst Mall, Waukegan, 
with a cheer-leading com- 
petition. The contest 
features all age levels from 
Daisy Girl Scouts (5 years 
old) through the Cadette 
level (ages 12-14). Each 
participating troop has 
written and choreographed 
its own original cheer to 
celebrate the kick-off of the 
1987 Girl Scout Cookie Sale. 

Cheerleading Chairman 
Kay Monroe of Elk Grove 
says, "Our girls have been 
working- on perfecting their 
cheers for months. The 
public is "welcome to join us 
and cheer on. the 600 girls! 
participating''. 

The "Visions of the 
Future" display contest will 
be judged at 10:30 a.m. by 
judges David Kennedy, 
former publisher ,of 
Waukegan News Sun; and 
Sharon Asquith, Art Director 
of the. David Adler Cultural 
Center in Libertyville. The 
entries depict America's 
future, and the role of future 
Girl Scouts, as seen through 
the eyes of today's girls. 

"This is the biggest Expo 
we've ever had," says 
volunteer Expo Chairman, 
Erica Dabrowski. "With 
over 150 troops participating 
- in the fashion show, display 
contest, cheerleading 
competition, and booth 
exhibits, there's something 
for everybody." 

The fashion show 
highlights the latest in 
spring fashions and Girl 
Scout Attire for 15 to 17 year 
old girls. The show begins at 
12:30 p.m. in the center of 
the mall, immediately after 
the announcement of 
"Visions" winners. 

As the price of admissions, 
troops are donating cans of 
food for distribution to Cook 
and Lake County Food 
Banks. 

For further information, 
please call the Girl Scout 
Centers at (312)640-5000 or 
(312)249-5830. 

Public 

Service 

Grows 

Fred Geiger, chief judge of 
the 19th judicial circuit 
announced that the number 
of people sentenced to public 
service by Lake County 
judges rose for the fifth 
consecutive year in 1986. 

Circuit court judges or- 
dered over 236,000 hours to 
be performed by 3,157 adults 
and juveniles as part of the 
punishment for their of- 
fenses last year. The work is 
performed for govern- 
mental, religious, charitable 
and veterans organizations 
at no cost to the agency 
. involved. 

Interested groups may call 
(312) 360-7379 to see if they

James Bruebach, 



Calvary Christian School 
Holds Science Fair 



Calvary Christian. School,, located on 
Monavilte Rd. in Lake Villa, held its first 
science fair on Feb. 5. It drew such en- 
thusiastic participation that plans are set to. 
make it an annual event. 

Students had been given the opportunity to 
choose their own topic or interest, and with 
the help of their families challenged to 
'compete for prizes awarded for top research, 
experimentation, display and oral presen- 
tation. 

. The more than 100 students involved 
displayed their unique projects while visitors 
ambled through the maze-like line-up of 
exhibits. 

As the children enthusiastically shared the 
information they had gathered, the onlookers 
came away richer with knowledge as to why 
airplanes fly, how to get birds at a feeder to 
eat all the seeds; shampoo comparisons and 
the effects of electricity on crystalization. 

The culmination of their five months or. 
crfort came when principal and pastor John 
Backes announced the judges' decisions and 
ribbons, trophies and plaques were awarded. 

Representing the second, third and fourth 
grades with Excellence Awards were 
Charles Markiel, Lamar Breshcars, Reuben 
Rogak, Wesley Eyre, Jonathon Novak, Dana 
Locke, Jeremy Bricc, Sheila sldve, Shcllie 



S love, Chris Sweeting, Pattie Waldenstrom, 
Chris- Pranschke, Lore Hake, Craig 
Somerville, Carmclla D'lncognito, Amy 
Mikal, Eric Mitchell, and Br ian Heitman. 

Good Merit Awards were given to Becky 
Backes, Scott Pearson, Nick Kurtz*, 
Nathaniel Brewer, Jecoa Osaria, Robert 
Smith, Pamela Valchant, Deryk Bigelow, 
Joe Styx, Greg Urban, ScottJMaczko, Tracey

Reflect On 'Patent' 



by GLORIA DAVIS 

Broadway doesn't know 
what it missed when the 
"Big Apple" as usual bowed 
to the opinion of the New 
York Times' theater critic 
and turned thumbs down on 
"Do Black Patent Leather 
Shoes Really Reflect Up." 

The fact that the original 
Chicago musical has broken 
box office records 
everywhere else and is back 
doing the same thing in 
Chicago where it holds the 
"longest running 

musicar'record, from 1979 
to 1982, should a test to the 
audience's receptiveness of 
John Powers' play of the 
scare tactics Catholic teens 
had to deal with 20 and 30 
years ago.; 

This time "Black 
Pa lent" is appearing at the 
Civic Theater, one of 
Chicago-land's best. 

Russ Thacker plays Eddie 
Ryan, the tormented 1950s- 
60s Catholic adolescent 
realistically, rating a well- 
done for his singing and 
acting and Eileen Black- 
man, ex-dork who finally 
gets lo crown the Blessed 
Virgin, turns in a good 
performance in the same 
two categories. 

Louis DeCrescenzo, the 
"fat boy", rates an out- 
standing for his entire 
performance and especially 
for his Elvis number 
"DooWaaDooWee". 

Other scene stealers in- 
clude Don(sex-minded) Stitt 
and the teacher's pet, 
Berniee Wood, who not only 
steals a scene but practically 
the entire first act of the 
play. 

Carol Estey as Sister Lee, 
who reminded me of the 
grandmother on "The 
Golden Girls", had me 



holding my sides remem- 
bering quite a few older nuns 
from my own high school 
'days as did Wally 
Englehardt's Father 
O'Reilly. Englehardt's 
performance was par- 
ticularly memorable during 
the confession scene. 

Loved all the song and 
dance numbers, all of which 
sound familiar but none of 
hit parade quality, and the 
giant black patent leather 
shoes were real show 
stoppers. 

I could have recited the 
whole premise of the show 
because my biology teacher 
at a girls' Catholic Academy 
in the 1950's was always 
reciting, "Don't. ever wear 
patent leather shoes, they 
reflect up; don't wear 
pearls, they reflect down; 
don't go to restaurants that 
have white tablecloths with a 
boy, it will remind him of 
bed sheets and don't sit on a 
boy's lap unless you have a 
magazine between you or he 
will feel your garters and gel 
excited." 

But "Black Patent" 
doesn't just appeal to the 
teens of the 50s, my son who 
went to a Catholic school in 
the late 60's and early 70's 
s also loved the play. 

Its a good wholesome 
nostalgic musical that will 
have you humming and 
tapping your feet no matter 
what your religion or age. On 
a scale of one to 10, this 
reviewer gives "Black 
Patent" an eight-and-one 
half. 

Cake Tip 

If a cake slips while you 
are icing it, skewer the 
layers together until the 
icing sets.

study of contemporary per- 
formance techniques at the 
Hochschule fur Musik, 
Theater und Tanz in Essen- 
Werden, Germany. 

Upon returning to the 
United States, he entered the 
doctoral program on 
scholarship at Northwestern 
University, again studying 
choral conducting with 
Hillis, and was awarded the 
doctor of music degree in 
1985. 

Drawing from his ex- 
perience and innate talent, 
Dr. Horisberger has a vigor 
and enthusiasm for choral 
music which he conveys to 
the choristers. His 
knowledge and un- 
derstanding of choral music, 
combined with his intuitive 
perception of the increasing 
ability of and skill of the 
chorus, allow him to 
program a season which is 
challenging and enjoyable to 
chorus and audiences alike. 

He emphasizes develop- 
ment of musicianship and 
vocal techniques through a 
variety of singing ex- 
periences. His attention to 
detail and his dedication to 
creating a balanced, well- 
blended choral sound have 
been major factors in the 
tremendous growth in both

Barat Rehearses 
'Miss Firecracker' 



Barat College's Per- 
forming Arts Center will 
present Beth Henley's "The 
Miss Firecracker Contest" 
at 8 p.m. March 6, 7, 13, 14 
and at 3 p.m., March 8 and 15 
in the Drake Theatre, 
Sheridan and Westleigh 
Rds., Lake Forest. '- 

Directing this zany, heart- 
warming comedy by the 
author . of "Crimes of the 
Heart" is California actor, 
director and author, Neal 
LaVine. Beth Henley is a 
great writer, says LaVine, . 
because, she creates sym- 
pathetic, multi-dimensional 
characters who are 
"beautifully delicate, yet 
comic." 

Set in a small town in the 
deep south in the heat of the 



summer, 



'The Miss 



Firecracker Contest" is the 
story of sensitive, innocent 
Carnelle Scott, who is 
regarded as the town slut. 
Seeking to gain the ac- 
ceptance and respect of her 
family and friends, she 
enters "The Miss 
Firecracker Contest," a 
silly, small town beauty 
pageant. Playing Carnelle is 
Pam Wild of Pewaukee, Wis. 

Like Carnelle, the other 
five members of the cast are

Quality Care Elusive By Anyone's Definition 



We got together, my friends and I, at our 
almost-monthly dinner. Dr. Synik was 
present. I like when he's there because he is 
somewhat like a quarterback named Mc : 
Mahon. He makes things happen. Since he

spares no one, I call him "outrageous." 

Friday, he didn't wait for us all to be 
seated wher^, apparently continuing an 
already ongoing conversation, he took Dr. 
Yungfren to task. "Then, how would you 



define good quality medical care?" 

I'd rather we started on a less contentious 
note so I tried pouring oil on troubled waters. 
•'You're asking the* impossible, Synik," I 
said. "It's an abstraction. Years ago, we felt 
that the emergency rooms at small-town 
hospitals were being*overuti!ized, so we tried 
to define the word emergency. There was no 
agreement between doctors, hospitals or 
patients. The patients added convenience so 
sometimes they visited the emergency room 
after they ate supper or came home from 
work. The hospitals felt it inappropriate to 
turn anyone away. Whatif the patients were 
right, or they exercised their prerogative of a 
free society to sue? In any- event, they 
thought is was poor public relations. Patients 
now come when they consider it necessary. 
The subject now' is brought up rarely-only 
when cost is considered. Quality care is just 
like 'emergency,* very arguable." 
Yugfren was unappeased. "Good medical

care is that quality afforded a patient by an 
adequately trained physician with means 
deemed most likely to have a good result and 
so approved by his peers." 

"Ho.ho," chortled Synik. "You're talking 
review by a jury of your peers or PKO." 

While Donnie, the waitress, took orders, 
there was only a slight pause. 

Dr. Wirtuos said with deep resignation, 
"There's nothing more likely to give our 
profession indigestion than bringing up 
PROS or peer review organizations." 

Dr. Bopal joined the fray. He is usually the 
person most apt to be precise in language. 
"You have to differentiate two kinds of peer' 
review. One is in a hospital setting^where a 
committee of a doctor's peers with adequate 
protection of due process will review his 
performance or quality of care. The new law 
passed by the 99th Congress protects the 
committee from suits. We don't have much 
problem with that here. We've been 
reviewing for many years." 

"And the other one," prompted Synik. 

Bopal's language can be really 
Americanese, especially now since his so'n 
reached Little League age. "You're talking 
about the Medicare PRO.. That's a group 
which contracts to 'inspect charts at the 
hospital and advise, among other things, as 
1 to whether the patient should even have been 
there. They are said to have signed a new^ 
two-year contract. Actually, these con- 
tractual groups are gagging a little. The 
powers that be have asked them to add 
evaluation of quality so it nearly doubles 
their load. I don't think they're paying them 
double though." 

Whinerk was most thoughtful. "They 
actually told about 27 of the PRO groups 



nationally, they had been doing it wrong. Are 
we to assume that these 27 groups advised 
that Medicare pay or not pay and were 
wrong? Youngfren's definition of quality 
care may not be acceptable or they may 
change it." 

We dug into our meals. Synik wasn't done 
yet. "Well, hot shot," this addressed to me. 
"You gave us quite a column two weeks ago. 
Someone out there is reading it. I even got 
some feedback from my own patients, But 
when is the deep stuff like HMO's coming?" 

I contented myself with saluting him in my 
usual dignified manner, using my salad fork. 

This time Bopal did not disappoint me. 
"HMO's or Health Maintenance 
Organizations are prepaid health plans in- 
tended to cut down on health costs. They care 
for your health needs, paying for what is 
considered medically necessary and 
fostering preventive means intended to keep 
patients healthy." 

"Right," I said. "And then there are IPA's, 
PPO's, and numerous variations. All will 
have to be measured by what any individual 
considers good care. It is like the old story of 
the blind men who felt different parts of an 
elephant. One said it was a wall, another a 
snake, another a tree. They can only be 
compared by what the patient needs. To that 
end, a questionnaire would probably be 
useful to help a hypothetical patient pick 
what kind of care he should get: private or 
HMO? 

We had finished now and bid our adieus. 
Outside, wrapping my muffler, I walked 
through the slush to my car. My colleageus, 
with their definitions, had clarified my 
musings and I hope yours.

EMERGENCIES arise in everyone's life — sometimes more frequently 
than we would like. We spend thousands of dollars on insurance, dead 
bolt locks, smoke detectors, alarms, and so forth. And yet, health can 
suffer or a life can be lost for lack of access to something as common 
and simple as a telephone. Luckily, this has been a mild winter; but, 
the next time your car breaks down, how cold will It be and how far will 
you be from a phone? Can your babysitter reach you when she needs 
to? How fast could you summon a police car or an ambulance In an un- 
familiar area? The peace of mind offered by a cellular car telephone Is 
more affordable today than ever before. For about the cost of a 25" 
color television, you can purchase a car telephone. And service rates 
start as low as $5.00 per month. Call Mundeleln Communications to- 
day for more information. We can install your phone the same day.

also owns specialty 
retailers-rThe talbots, 
which sells women's ap- 
parel, and Eddie Bauer, 
marketers of outdoor ap- 
parel through retail stores 
and catalog sales. 

Performance: In the first 
half of the 1987 fiscal year, 
earnings were $1.29, vs. $1.05 
for the same period last 
year~a 23 percent gain. 

Forecast: Look for high 
earnings for the foreseeable 
future. General Mills is a 
billion-dollar company in 
terms of sales, and is well- 
positioned in its respective 
businesses. 

"General Mills is a truly 
superior company which 
should trade at a 30 percent 
premium to the overall 
market. This would give us a 
target price of around $60," 
said Hoden. 

It is currently trading at

sumer and agricultural 
cerdit, and credit life in- 
surance. 

It acquired Crocker 
National Bank in May, 1986. 
Wells Fargo believes this 
acquisition will boost its 
earnings in 1987. 

Performance: Wells 
Fargo split two to one on 
Jan. 20, which Hoden says 
will improve prospects for 
its "already well- 
eastablished growth. They 
simply have superior 
management/' 

Forecast: Hoden projects 
that earning should grow at 
20 percent-plus through 1988, 
reaching $6.25 for 1987 and 
$7.50 for 1988. 

"Wells Fargo was the best- 
performing stock of the 50 
largest banking companies 
during 1986," said Hoden. 
"Look for it to do even belter 
in 1987." 
Lorimar-Tclcpicturcs. 

Suitable for: This stock is 
suitable for moderately 
aggressive investors. 

Description: Lorimar, a

tertainment (the largest

nine TV stations. 

Performance:^ Lorimar 
stock topped out at 33 prior 
to the restructuring and then 
dove dramatically to 17. 
"The factors causing decline 
were mostly psychological,"

The village officials stressed to the 
audience that Thursday's upcoming hearing 
before the planning commission was 
specifically, and only, to consider, the 
developer's application that had already 
been submitted, a request for rezoning from 
H-4 to K-5 multiple units, and the final P.U.D. 
plans detailing the property layout, land-, 
scaping such as existing trees of more than 
10 in. diameter, open space, and a 150 ft. 
buffer strip. 

Citizens pointed out that the proposal calls 
for six buildings of 16 apartments each on 
slightly more than six acres of land, in- 
cluding the parking area and buffer. They - 
expressed objection to such heavy con- 
centration. 

They also questioned whether enough 
tenants could be found for this many units. 
Mayor Toft responded that developers only 
want to build, multiple units when they find 
sufficient demand for them in the area. 

Although members of the audience 
sometimes spoke two or three at a time, 
there was no hostility on cither side of the 
discussion. Much of the questioning took the 
form of clarification of the situation and 
what could be done about it. 

The citizens raised the issue of whether the 
proposed new storm water retention ponds 

Hillview

suant to tne act. Testimony and documents 
not before the agency at the time the agency 
made its decision are irrelevant." 

Fourth, the brief points out, "Hillview's 
proposed expansion of its waste storage 
facility in excess of two million gallons 
constitutes a new regional pollution control 
facility and in particular, a waste storage 
facility requiring local approval under 
sections 3 and 39.2 of the (pollution control) 
act." An earlier court decision defined ^'the 
boundary of a 'currently permitted' facility 
is determined by the length and width 
allowed in the original permit," and, the 
"IEPA adds, "Hillview has requested lateral 
extension of its currently permitted waste 
storage facility." 

Fifth, the brief states, "The documentation 
or ownership or letters of acceptance as is 
required for all sites which Hillview has 
designated for sludge utilization was 
deficient at the close of the record and 
warranted denial of the application." 

The IEPA points out that information 
provided in a schedule signed by Arnold May 
represented that no lands for which a permit 
is required were the subject of a trust, yet a 
later title search by the Illinois attorney 
general disclosed that four of the sites were 
held entirely by trusts, and parls of three 
others were also in trusts. It adds that even 
after Hillview amended its represen- 
tation. ..the agency determined that there 
were still questions of ownership." 

Sixth, "Evidence and exhibits submitted ■ 
by citizens and public officials of McHenry 
county brought into question at the Dec. 11, 
1985, hearing: 1) whether 733 acres was 
representative of the injectable acreage 
available at Hillview because of the 
ownership issues of Section V; 2) whether 
Hillview had properly excluded buffer 
acreage; and 3) whether Hillview as the 
result of exclusions because of ownership 
issues, buffer, excessive slopes, marshy 
areas and soils with low pH had sufficient 
available injection sites to apply existing 
volumes of 22 million gallons of sludge an- 
nually." 

The IEPA brief explains that "evidence 
and exhibits provided by citizens and the 
McHenry County Dept. of Health at the 
agency hearing created a serious doubt as to 
whether the 733 acres represented by. 
Hillview in its permit application were all 
available for injection or sludge." 

Seventh, the IEPA states, "Review of soil 
survey and soil analysis reports disclosed 
that injection sites had characteristics of 
steep slopes in excess of 8 percent... areas of 
poorly drained marshy soils, houghton and 
lena muck where sludge should not be ap- 
plied. ..and sites having soil pH less than 
6.5.. .which if no. restricted from sludge 
application would violate specific provisions 
of part391: sludge application regulations." 

Eighth, the IEPA challenges the testimony 
by Dr. Arthur E. Peterson, professor of soil 
science at the University of Wisconsin 
college of agriculture and life science a nd the 
Wisconsin agriculture experiment station, 
stating that his "testimony, calculations, and 
documents failed to dispel the agency's 
concerns oyer whether Hillview had suf- 
ficient available acreage to apply existing or 



for the area could handle the extra burden of 
this project. Mayor Toft replied that one or 
the ponds on Anita St. was increased in size 
from two to three and a half acres with help 
of property, donated for this purpose, and 
would be adequate. 

Toft also pointed out that the project 
parking area might be designed to control 
slow runotf, like those at Jewel-Osco and 
McDonald's. These parking areas are 
sunken lower than the surrounding streets 
''and properties and temporarily hold back 
part of the water. 

In response to another question from the 
audience, Toft denied that there is any truth 
to a rumor about possible plans to connect 
Greenbriar St. through because of the 
proposed apartments. The mayor stated 
that the village owns the 6.8 acres beyond 
Greenbriar, but does not have any plans to do 
anything with it. 

Other citizens asked whether the developer 
could switch plans from apartment buildings 
to duplexes and four-flats that would be 
permitted by the present zoning. The mayor 
replied that present zoning would allow four- 
fiats along Anita St. and duplexes to the east, 
but that this could not be done unless the 
developer started all over again with a new 
application, new plans, and new hearings 
before the zoning and planning boards. 



the proposed increased volumes of sludge." 

Ninth, "The agency objects and moves to 
strike the testimony of Joanne M. May, 
Ph.D., on numerous grounds of prejudice, 
conflict of interest and especially because it 
was not proper rebuttal testimony of her 
experiences in the record but was an im- 
peachment of all those who testified against 
Hillview which is not proper subject matter 
of an expert witness." 

The IEPA brief poipts out that after the 
Dec. 11, 1985 hearing Joanne M. Pollock, 
Ph.D., submitted a letter in defense of the 
Hillview operations and "identified herself 
as a psychologist working fulltimc in a 
mental health center and teaching p- 
sychology in the department of psychology at 
Loyola University. As a, citizen, she iden- 
tified herself only to be&gt; very familiar with 
Hillview and was appalled when she heard 
citizen testimony about objectionable odors 
coming from Hillview. 

"Later in this proceeding," the brief 
continues, "Joanne MTMay, Ph.D. appeared 
with identical credentials and identical 
address to that of Joanne M. Pollock to 
impeach citizen testimony under the theories 
of judgmental heuristics. During her 
testimony she identified herself as the eldest 
daughter of Arnold May." 
' In conclusion the brief states, "Not- 
withstanding the (IEPA) agency's 
demonstration that its denial was based on 
the record of this proceeding, the agency 
maintains that this permit appeal should be 
dismissed because the prior filing of the 
permit application divests the board of 
authority to rule on this permit appeal. 
Furthermore petitioner's (Hillview's) en- 
dorsement of the agency's denial of ad- 
ditional storage concedes that the agency's 
determination that the permit if granted 
would violate the board's rules and the act 
which are the very ground for the board to 
deny this permit appeal," adding, "as the 
record indicates, Hillview's application as of 
Dec. 11, 1985, was incomplete, inaccurate 
and misleading." 

.The IEPA brief concludes, "Despite 
petitioner's attempt to confuse respon- 
sibilities of the agency for permit application 
review, to invent and impose spurious 
requirements on the agency, to accuse the 
the agency of improper conduct and to divert 
attention from the deficiencies in the 
petitioner's application, the record is clear 
petitioner's submission for additional waste 
storage requires local siting approval and 
petitioner's application for renewal of its 
permit failed to demonstrate that Hillview 
would continue its operations in con- 
formance with the act, the board regulations 
and.. .sludge application rules."

local governmental positions, the elections in 



If no write-in votes are received before a

tion itself and automatically declare the can-

costs. 

Gore Vidal often has had something in- 



v 



When I Think About It 



both Lake and Kenosha Counties are for the 
most part non-partisan races — or are they? 

The old two party system is still present in 
many cases. Everyone knows that being a 
Democrat in either of the outlying county 
locales is tantamount to being a Republican 
in the City of Chicago or Milwaukee. 

And members of the GOP arc watched 
carefully when they invade the inner sanc- 
tums of the city bastions. 

Politics has always been an enigma as far 
as I'm concerned. Many people vote for a 
candidate for the strangest of reasons, which 
they can always justify at the drop of a 
questioning hat. 

For instance, my Mother still believes 
every word that the politicans throw at her, 
ergo, the last candidate she hears speak will 
be the one that gets her vote. 

The experts claim that a well-known name 
is usually a sure-fire winner as long as that 
name isn't tainted: knowledge, experience, 
and capability be damned! 

Even that is not always true, how many 
times have people that have been either ac- 
cused or convicted of a crime been reelec- 
ted? And everyone has read at least one 
story about a dead candidate walking away 
with an election even though the demise was 
well publicized beforehand. 

The cost of opening and running polls 
grows each election. It might seem 
ridiculous to some to open polls when there is 
only one candidate for each office. I know — I 
know, there is always the possibility of write- 
in candidates. 

By informing the people through the 
media, why not set-up some sort of absentee 
balloting for those who intend to write in the 
name of someone who has not professed to be 
running for office?

He also has commented that, "there are

The validity of these words hits home in the

As H. U Menken said, "There are some

^ing Soli 




by CHARLES JOHNSTON 
Managing Editor 

Amid all the sound and 
fury over proposals by ARF 
Landfill to expand, its 
Grayslake site and Waste 
Management of Illinois to 
create a waste-to-energy 
plant with associated landfill 
just up the road is a simple 
fact that sometimes gets 
overlooked: Lake County, 
has a waste problem that 
must be dealt with soon. 

The county board sparked 
a furious outcry when it 
included the Waste. 
Management landfill and 
incinerator as part of its 
settlement of the Heartland 
lawsuits last October. The 
fury grew even wilder as, 
almost simultaneously, ARF 
Landfill Corp. applied to 
double the size of its existing 
sanitary landfill near 
Grayslake, just north of the 
proposed Waste 

Management site. 

The way the county board 
handled the issue was 
probably more troublesome 



than the issue of landfills 
themselves. Between. - the 
time of the public an- 
nouncement and final board 
approval, scarcely 24 hours 
passed. The general public 
had little, if any, time to- 
study the proposal before it 
officially became the set- 
tlement. Although public 
hearings are being held on 
Waste Management's 
proposal, many feel that 
potential areas of debate 
could have been avoided 
with more time for public 
comment. Board members 
should have understood that 
even the best of agreements, 
if arrived at in secret, arouse 
deep resentment and 
suspicion from the general 
public. 

Adding fuel to the fire was 
the fact that the entire 
Heartland settlement was 
made contingent on the 
successful approval of Waste 
Management's proposal. 
Local groups, such - as 
Citizens of Lake County for 
Environmental Action 



Problem Will Require Study 






Reform (CLEAR) question 
whether county board 
members can give an ob- 
jective hearing on the 
matter when they are a 
party to the, settlement 
agreement. William Alter, 
prominent developer, has 
land which borders the 
proposed landfill. He has 
raised the same question. 

In 1983, the county and 
most of its municipalities 
formed the Solid Waste 
Advisory Committee, which 
has now given way to the 
Joint Action Solid Waste 
Planning Agency. The ad- 
visory committee was 
created in recognition or the 
fact that Lake County has a 
serious problem in dealing 
with its solid municipal 
wastes (better known as 
household garbage to most 
people) over the next several 
decades. The projected 
lifespan of Lake County's 
existing landfills will not 
provide service into the next 
century. With aggressive 
development,- service may 



not be available even in the 
next decade. 

In principle, the Solid 
Waste Advisory Committee 
adopted the incineration 
approach, such as Waste 
Management has proposed. 
It extends the lifespan of a 
landfill because ash is buried 
instead of raw garbage. Ash 
is less likely to pose a con- 
tamination problem in the 
soil and water supply. In- 
cineration is an approach 
that has gained many 
adherents throughout the 
country because, when 
properly done, it is safer, 
provides energy, and 
tremendously extends the 
life of landfills. 

All municipalities and the 
county are eligible members 
of the Joint Action Solid 
Waste Planning Agency. The 
agency is supposed to take 
responsibility for deter- 
mining sites and approving 
plans to deal with the solid 
waste problem. What has 
angered many members of 
the committee is that they 




Dangerous Site 

Wauconda Sand and Gravel Pit is listed on U.S. En- 
vironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) documents as 
one of IV most potentially dangerous sites in State of 
Illinois. Lake County has three of 11 most potentially 



dangerous sites, more than any other county in state. 
Site has been accepted as a USEPA superfund priority 
location. (Source: Illinois Environmental Protection 
Agency-sites submitted for superfund cleanup.) 




Landfill Forum Participants 



U S. Cable television will prdsent a forum program on 
topic of ARF Landfill's proposed expansion to be aired 
Feb 24 26 and 27. Participants include, back row 
from left: Bruce Hansen, Dist. 6 County Board 
Member; John Reindl, Dist. 6 County Board Member; 
George Ranney, CLEAR member;. Dennis. Ryan, at- 

Ihursday, February 1 9, 1 987 



perceive the county's action 
as having bypassed the new 
agency, thus usurping its 
funtion even as it was for- 
med. 

Still, the reality is that the 
ARF : expansion and the 
Waste Management 
proposal are what must be 
dealt with now. The question 
of whether or not the county 
board acted properly is a 
political one which voters 
will be able to decide at the 
next county board election. 

Citizens of Lake County 
have good reason- to be 
suspect of any plan the 
county submits, though: the 
simple truth is that Lake 
County has not had a good 
record of protecting its 
citizens from the ill effects of 
pollution. Of the 11 most 
potentially hazardous waste 
sites in Illinois, according to 
the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, three are 
in Lake County. They are at 
OMC, Johns-Manville and 
Wauconda Sand and Gravel: 
That is more than any' other 
county in the state, including 
Cook, has. 

Landfills and waste 
disposal, controversial and 
undesirable as they may be, 
are not something people 
can just say no to. Part of the 
reason Lake County has such 
a poor record is that its 
planning on the subject has 
been deficient. To just say no 
to the existing proposals

Board Member; and Tony Titus, farmer and president

Sorenson, host of Lake County Forum for U.S. Cable. 



without offering alternate 
acceptable plans is almost 
certain to make matters 
worse. 

Some have suggested that 
landfills should be located in 
Jess populous McHenry 
County. The fact is that 
McHenry residents are no 
more enthusiastic about 
becoming Lake County's 
garbage dump than Lake 
County residents are about 
becoming Cook's. That is a 
plan that avoids the problem 
rather than dealing with it. 

What is clear is that both 
proposals will have to be 
judged on their merits. In 
future additions to this 
series, Lakeland 

Newspapers will deal with 
the records of ARF and 
Waste Management and 
details of their proposals. 
4 The ARF hearings are 
complete, though the public 
may send written comments 
to the Lake County Clerk. All 
comments received by 
March 9 will become part of 
the permanent record of the 
hearings. The regional 
pollution control hearing 
committee will consider the 
full record and make 
recommendations on March 
12. The full county board will 
act on those recom- 
mendations at a special 
meeting on March 24. 

The hearings on Waste 
Management's proposal are 
in process right now. 




Conclusions Of Solid 
Waste Advisory Board 

; f) The preferred waste disposal system for Lake County 
consists of : a 1^200 ton per day mass. burn incinerator .with 
the sale of steam and electricity or only electricity; transfer 
stations; a recycling, program; and JandfilHng for non- 
combustibles. 

2). The preferred waste disposal system was based upon an 
estimate that' 1,800 tons of waste are generated in Lake 
County every day. 

3) If there is no change or expansion of the existing solid 
waste disposal system in Lake County;- the landfills in the 
? courity will be filled !to capacity by 1994 to 1997. 

4) With the implementation of me preferred waste disposal 
system, the need for new landfills wiltbe postponed by ap- 
proxirnalely five years and the life expectancy of the new 
landfills will extend over a longer period of time. : ..;■'; 

5) There are two potentially viable energy markets in Lake 
County for the steam and, electricity produced by the mass 
burn incinerator: the Great- Lakes Naval Training Center 
and Commonwealth Edison. Both of these have expressed an 
interest in being potential energy customers. 

6) The State's Attorney's office has issued the opinion that 
Public Act 82-682 ( the landfill siting law known as Senate BUI 
;172) severely restricts the county's authority in the area of 
landfill and waste facility siting. 

7) Citizen participation in the development of the 
feasibility study was verybroad.

Editorial 






Main St. Under Fire 



Our concern for the preservation of 
downtown shopping hubs and main street 
values is well known to regular readers of 
this page. We happen to believe that a 
community with a traditional downtown 
shopping area and its variety of shops and 
main street atmosphere is a complete place 
to live. 

As a practical matter, though, it's getting 
more difficult all the time to keep main 
street, where it still exists, intact and 
thriving for a couple of overriding reasons: 
One, the action for builders and developers is 
on the edge of town; two, consumers appear 
to be indifferent to the plight of main street. 
For the latter reason, public officials Jean 



toward growth and development away from 
main street. As they say, politicians count 
votes and main street isn't getting the voles 
anymore. 

For the above reasons, Antioch merchants 
are girding for a knock down, drag out battle 
over plans for development of a strip 
shopping center on the south side of the 
village. Over the years, they've been pretty 
successful in thwarting retail development 
on the edge of town, but this time no one is 
taking any bels. 

It will be interesting to see how the battle 
goes. The Antioch Zoning Board has called 
for an impact study to be delivered within 120 
days. At least that will allow for a cooling off 
period. 



Abolish 55 Rule 



Only a couple of factors stand in the way of 
abolishment of the outmoded and 
troublesome 55 m.p.h. speed limit on rural 
stretches of the interstate highway system. 
Those are substantial opposition in the U.S. 
House and the gnawing fact that the 55 
m.p.h. limit has saved lives. 

We agree with the Senate where it was 
voted 65-33 to raise the speed limit to 65 
m.p.h. in rural areas where the traffic flows 
freely. This is the area where the accident 
rate is substantially lower and where most 



motorists, impatient with the dullness of 
interstate driving, "are made" into 
Jawbreakers by the 55 m.p.h. law thai 
originally was designed as a conservation 
device during the Arab oil embargo. 

In our opinion, 55 m.p.h. is reasonable and 
appropriate in urban areas and non- 
interstates. But driving habits of the public 
have shown that 55 is not supported on the 
open interstates by motorists. The un- 
workable and difficult-to-enforce limit 
should be abolished. 



Foreign Influence 



A dramatic increase in foreign investment 
in American companies has made its mark 
in Illinois. 

Nationally, 1954 employment by foreign 
affiliates was over twice 1977 employment 
levels. In Illinois, employment by foreign 
affiliates increased by 66,400 (90 percent 
from 1977 to 1984. Total non-agricultural 
employment increased by 16,800 during the 
same period. 

The impact of increased participation of 
foreign firms in the state's economy is so far 
unclear. 

There is always the possibility foreign 
owners might move their operations out of 
the U.S. to their home nations. 

However, proponents of increased foreign 
involvement in the American economy might 
contend new technology will spur American 



business and industry to improve their 
products in the face of competition. At least 
that is the theory.

Irish (All Stripes) 
Gathering To Fete 
Favorite Saint 




by BILL SCHROEDER 

If you're Irishtgenuine article) or an 
imposteir, mark this date on your calendar. 
St. Patrick's parade, 2 p.m. March 14. 

That wil! be the local version of St. Paddy's 
shindigs all over the land with a parade step 
off at Washington and Genesee Sis. in 
Waukegan. The line of march will continue to 
Immaculate Conception Church where ladies 
of the parish will be serving corned beef.and 
cabbage. There will be an ample supply of 
appropriate beverages to take away the sting 
of early spring breezes. 

Eddie O'Grady, our favorite bartender and 
a fixture in arranging suitable recognition of 
Ireland's favorite saint, promises a good 
time for all. "You don't have to be Irish to 
attend," Eddie exclaims assuredly. While 
O'Grady is making arrangements in the, 
background, ceremonial details will be 
handled by Chairman Noah Murphy who is 
lining up other Irish dignitaries like 
Waukegan Mayor Robert O'Sabonjian, 
Judge Jack O'Hoogasian and State Atty. 
Fred Foiremanahan. 

A grand lady from the Olde Sod will be 
back as Head Leprechaun — Jessie O'Grady, 
who turned a spritely 95 on New Years Day. 
"I'll be out there, all right but I'm going to 
miss my partner," remarked Mrs. O'Grady, 
referring to Bob O'Farrel, long-time parade 
marshal at Lake County St. Patrick's Day 
observances who now is confined to a rest 
home. Bob, the former major league cat- 
ching great, is 85. 

As O'Grady put it, "The parade and 
reception are for both the righthanded and 
lefthanded Irish." Eddie didn't explain the 
difference and it really doesn't matter — at 
least for St. Patrick's Day. 

i •••*•••• 

INTEREST MOUNTING— Indications at 
open meetings point toward genuine interest 



on the part of the public at hearings on the 
proposed plan for commuting on the Soo 
Line. 

Further interest was sounded at a meeting 
Monday night in Grayslake. There are two 
more meetings in the Lakeland area 
scheduled by transit officials to gauge public 
opinion on the Soo Line commuting plan— 8 
p.m. March 3, Round Lake Beach village hall 
and7:30 p.m. March 16 Antioch village hall. 

••••• ••* 

TV APPEARANCE— Chalk up another 
area resident who is achieving fame in 
television. Billy Kent of Fox Lake will make 
his TV debut Wednesday, Feb. 25, in a 
Magnum, PI episode. Besides acting, Kent is 
one of the principals in the ownership and 
operation of Juice Box Saturday Night, 
popular 50's sports bar'on Stanton Point Rd! 
An interesting sidelight to Kent's role will be 
an appearance by Frank Sinatra, a "first" 
for the singer on a regular TV series. 

SUPER 4T1I— Lake County's biggest July 
4 celebration in years, maybe the biggest 
ever, is taking shape now at Ft. Sheridan, 
where the gates will be thrown open to 
everyone to join in a massive Independence 
Day observance. 

Ft. Sheridan's commanding officer, Col. 
Marshall U. McRee, bubbles over with en- 
thusiasm when he talks about plans for (he 
4th, which will be a keystone for the 
venerable military installation's centennial. 

"We'll have a big parade and there'll be a 
community picnic. We'll have the bands 
playing. There'll be fun for everyone. At 
night we'll have a big fireworks show," the 
former artillery officer outlined. Col. Mcttee 
stressed that Ft. Sheridan's July 4 event will 
be an old-fashioned patriotic spectacle. 

Sounds like a good place to be July 4. 




Letter To The Editor: 



Saga Of Unwanted Dog 

Editor: j 

Time and lime again we have seen animals 
dumped on the side of the road by their 
supposedly "caring" family. The family 
hopes someone will take over their 
responsibility of the pet and look after them. 
But they have forgotten what a trauma this is 
to the animal, and what it is like for them to 
try to find something to eat and drink and a 
warm pllace to curl up on a cold night. Or 
someone to look after them when they need 
medical attention. 

This was some of the feelings of the brown 
dog that had lived in the area of Deep Lake 
Rd. and Grand Ave., after being pushed out 
of a car by some man. This dog had worked 
hard at surviving on its own. Thank goodness 
for some thoughtful, caring people that tried 
to care for the dog Trom afar. Thanks to the 
lady that went to that spot every day faith- 
fully for over a year and a half to leave food 
and who went there in the dark of night to 
leave a clog house for shelter for this dog. 

This dog would not trust anyone after it 
was dumped, unwanted in this area. On just 
a couple occasions it seemed to gain some 
trust, but then some stranger would come in 
hopes of catching or trapping the dog, only to 
frighten it once again. 

About a week ago, when theladv went to 
take the rood that evening, she found the dog 
lying on the Bide or the road, obviously hit bv 
a car. 

How very sad for those that cared so much 
to try to befriend the little brown dog that 
some irresponsible family cared so little 
about. This was so unfair to put the dog 
through such a lonely, rrightening existence 
for such a long period of lime. 

If you have an animal that you no longer 
want as a member or your family (that is 
what they are or should be), show some 



kindness and compassion for this living 
creature. Call the animal warden or a 
humane society, but don't just dump the 
animal on the side of the road. It may never 
trust anyone enough to let them help it. Can 
you live with those thoughts? 

The uncaring never have second thoughts 
over what they have done, but the concerned 
lose hours of sleep worrying about the well- 
being of the abandoned pets and how and if 
they can help. . 

Tha nks to all those that showed concern for 
the little dog. She won't have to be frightened 
and lonely any longer. 

Beverly J. Salo 
Gurnee 



Questions Consumer Group 

Editor: 

I was in total agreement with your latest 
commentary regarding the fairness of the 
proposed electric rale plan. It would have 
been good for the public, especially those on 
fixed incomes, and good for the economy of 
the stale. 

The leadership of self-styled and self- 
serving so-called consumer interest groups 
more interested in garnering headlines and 
personal aggrandizement have let their 
misplaced zealotry befog their judgment and 
have shot down this very viable plan put 
forward by the utility. 

The groups had better not solicit me for 
funds. They don'tspeak for thisconsumcr. 

I note with some alarm that the leader and 
spokesman of the most vocal group in 
shooting down the plan is an attorney. I 
wonder, who serves who?

Teaming Their Efforts

Warren Aims For Second, 
Sequoits For Momentum 



Two teams who won two 
games last week will meet 
Feb. 21 at, the College of 
Lake County. 

The game between Warren 
and Antioch, with a 7:30 p.m. 
start at the College of Lake 
County, is Lakeland 
Newspapers' Game of the 
Week. 

For Warren, the contest 
will be a chance to gain a 
strong foothold on second 
place in the North Suburban 
Conference. The Blue 
Devils, though, must first 
tangle with North Suburban 
Conference champions Lake 
Forest Feb. 20. 

Antioch, which struggled 
through most of the season, 
now has won two straight 
and four of five. The Sequoits 
play at Zion-Benton Feb. 19. 

Both Warren coach Darrcl 
Bader and Antioch's Don 
Zeman came away with 
smiles last week. 

"I thought we were much 
improved. We had only 18 
turnovers for the two games 
and we shot right around 50 
percent from the field in both 
games," Bader said. - 

Warren beat Fenton 53-42 
and Zion-Benton 47-45 last 
week. 

Against Zion, the Blue 
Devils needed every one of 



Brian JarrelFs eight fourth- 
quarter free throws to ice the 
home win. 

Warren led 15-6 after one, 
but Zion began chipping 
away in the second quarter. 



Game Of 

The Week 




The Zee-Bees won each of 
the next three quarters but 
that was not enough to 
overcome Warren's lead. 

Jarrell finished with 24 
points Tor the night and was 
the only Warren player in 
double digits. 

Lake Forest edged Warren 
at CLC in the first round, 
overcoming a large first-half 
deficit. 

"Their defensive pressure 
hurt us in the first game," 
Bader said. 

Antioch, meanwhile, may 
use its newfound rebounding 
skills in its game against 
Zion. 

"They're going to have 
some quickness but we 
should matehup^with them in 
size," Zeman said of Zion. 

Antioch is coming off a 56- 
55 win over Liberty ville and 



a 25-23 half time lead. An- 
tioch's lead shrunk in the 
second half as Libertyville 
' rallied and the Wildcats had 
the advantage with just 1:54 
left. 

But the Sequoits' , Scott 
Fra'sh hit a jumper with :33 
left for the winning basket. 

Against Fenton, Tom 
Wells's hot shooting paved 
the way. for Antioch. Wells 
made 13-for-21 shots from 
the field, scoring 27 points. 

Zeman praised the 
rebounding efforts of John 
Mehnert, who had 14 
rebounds. 

In fact," it : has been 
Mehnert's play and that of 
sixth man Wade Kilman 
which has sparked Antioch 
as of late, Zeman said. 



Area Wrestlers Advance 



For a handrul of area 
wrestlers, the wrestling 
season did not end at the 
Barririgton Sectional. 

Winning sectional titles 
were North Chicago's 
Robert Ellis at 126 pounds 
and Antioch's Billy Eves at 
112 and Johnsburg's Sean 
Kegel at 105. 

Warren advanced two 
wrestlers, to the state meet. 
John Frccking, in only his 
second year in wrestling, 
placed second at 167. Jeff 
Taylor also- finished second, 
at 138. 



Jason Smith or Carmel 
finished third • at 138, 
defeating John Mazur of 
Grant. 

Grant's representative 
downstate will be Brad 
Frystak, who finished 
second at 185 pounds. 

Grant coach Don Rowden 
said- injuries just before 
regionals hurt his team's 
chances. 

"The season was suc- 
cessful in some respects, nut 
a couple of injuries just 
before regionals really hurt. 
One of our goals was to win 



CLC Hoops Teams Split 
League Tilts With Wright 



a 63-55 win over Fenton. The 
wins improved Antioch to 6- 
16 overall, 5-10 in the NSC. 

Against Libertyville, 
Antioch overcame a four- 
point deficit'after one to take 

- 



reagionals," Rowden said. 

Grant's John Bakis missed 
the coveted state meet trip 
when he finished fourth at 
145 pounds. 

Johnsburg advanced two 
wrestlers to the state meet. 
Kegel beat Jason Ncumark 
of Deerfieid 7-2 for the 
championship at 98 pounds. 
, Mike Lewis was third at 105. 

Area wrestlers finishing 
fourth were: Dan Torres of 
Wauconda at heavyweight 
and Jeff; Chumbley of 
Warren at 126. 



The College of Lake County's basketball 
teams split a pair of games with visiting 
Wright College Feb. 10. 

The men entered the game one game 
behind Wright (now 10-2 in the Skyway 
Conference) with intentions of sweeping the 
Rams in the season series. The Rams, 
however, wanted to avenge their earlier two- 
point loss to CLC and a that's eaxctly what 
happened, as Wright won 71-69. - 

The men host Oakton in their last home 
game Feb, 19at7p.m. 
, Wright took cammand early against CLC. ' 

The Lancers appeared intimidated, tur- 
ning the ball over several times, allowing the 
visitors to jump to an early 10-2 lead. The 
Rams held a six to 10 point lead for a good 10 
minutes, but Lake County surged back. CLC 
cut the lead to 27-24 with under six minutes 
left in the half, but Wright pulled together 
another spurt before the intermission, taking 
a 36-29 edge. 

The Lancers started the second half with 



place in the conference with an 8-4 mark, lo- 
ll overall. 

David Tucker popped in 20 points, Gunther 
17 a nd Da ve Si tz 15. Wright's Andre Tyler led 




all scorers with 23 points. 

In the preliminary game, CLC's Lady 
Lancers chilled the visiting Rams, a la 
Karen Hermann. Hermann, a first-year 
hopes of putting together another one of their forward, pumped in a season and game high 
second half explosions, but the Rams were 35 points as the Lancers routed the Lady 



there to answer as they jumped out to a 
double-digit lead midway through the second 
half. Lake County, which never saw the lead, 
didn't put together a spurt until late in the 
game. 

With the score 60-47 Wright, CLC 
proceeded to outscore Wright 20-8. With :42 
remaining, Lancer Terry Wright sank two 
free throws to cap CLC's comeback. The 
Rams' Mike Patterson hit two key free 
throws with under :35 left, upping the lad to 
three at 70-67. The Lancers closed the margin 
to one following two free throws by Don 
Gunther with five seconds left. CLC was then 
forced to foul, and the Rams hit one of two 
shots at the line, preserving their trimuph. 

With the loss, the Lancer fell to second 



Rams, 65-35. Wright's closest deficit was 2-0 
in the opening minutes, as Hermann and the 
gang took charge. CLC led 34-22 and Her- 
mann scored 22 of those 34 points. Liz 
Steiding and Kelly Halkyard finished the 
game with eight and six points, respectively. 

Lake County outscored Wright 31-13 in the 
second half to cruise to the win. 

The win upped CLC's record to 3-3 in the 
Skyway Conference, 11-10 overall. 

CLC now looks forward to sectionals after 
their last home game against Oakton Feb. 19 
at 5 p.m. 

"We're going to have to work real hard 
because McHenry is our first opponent in the 
postseason and they arer usually a tough 
outfit," CLC coach Chuck Schramm said. 



Carmel Faces Challenge 
To Continue Win Streak 



The first time Carmel 
played East Suburban 
Catholic Conference leader 
St. Joseph, the Corsairs 
played close to the state- 
ranked team for three 
quarters. 

But a fourth-quarter spree 
by St; Joseph turned the 
game into a 12-point win. 
.Carmel coach Frank 
Belmont believes his team 
has to stay even with St. 
Joseph if the result is to 
change Feb. 20. After 
playing St. Joseph, Carmel 
hosts Mt. Carmel Feb. 21. 

"You have to stay close to 
Sl. ; Joseph. You have to 
avoid a situation where they 
score six or eight points in a 
row. They are just too good a 
team to come back" on," 
Belmont said. 

Belmont said the away 
game will be a tournament- 
tester for the Corsairs. The 
Corsairs , coming off a 54-40 
win at Notre Dame * last 
week, have won five of their 
last six and have gained a tie 
for second in the ESCC with 
St. Patrick. 

"We're in a Ue for second 
now and we can decide our 
own fate. This will be a great 
game to prepapre us for the 
tournament," Belmont said. 

Carmel's win over Notre 
Dame improved its record to 
14-8 overall, 9-3 in ESCC 
play. 

Notre Dame, last in the 
league, attempted to slow 
the game down early. Notre 
Dame took just seven shots 
in the first hair and the hosts 
had led 6-5 after one. 

Carmel, trailing 19-14, 
staged a six-point rally 
which gained the visitors a 
20-19 halftime lead. Carmel 
credited the play of reserves 
ToriT Johnson, Aubrey 
O'Bryant and Steve Bruns as 
keys in the first half. 



"They were really ef- 
fective when we. had foul 
trouble in the first half," 
Belmont said. 

Carmel was able to open 
up its offense in the third 
quarter, extending its lead to 
36-29. 



Rob Graham led Carmel 
with 21 points, John Welling 
had 12 and Scott Stahoviak 11 
in CarmeJ's balanced attack. 

Carmel shot better than 50 
percent from the field and 
made 16-for-22 from the free- 
throw line.

Powerhouse Grant Now 
'Complete Team': Maple 



Kessel: Mustangs 
Must Pull Together 



This may come as a shock 
to those teams who have 
been victimized by Grant as 
the Bulldogs rolled to 20 
victories so far this year. 

Coach Tom Maple now 
believes his squad is com- 
plete. 

That's right, the Bulldogs 
appear to be more potent 
than ever. Sure, they still 
have the inside attack of Don 
Kiesgan and Ron Kichford, 
but Grant's guards - Mike 
McDonald and Mike 
Kazlausky - are getting in 
the scoring column more. 

"Our guards have been 
playing better and now we're 
a complete ballclub. We've 
always been a good ballclub, 
but now we're a complete 
ballclub," Maple said. 

McDonald and 

Kazlausky's scoring were 
the main punches as Grant 
rolled to wins No. 19 and No. 
20 over Marengo and 
Grayslake last week. Mc- 
Donald scored 21 points 
against Marengo in Grant's 
62-48 win against the 
league's second place team 
and 12 against Grayslake in 
a 71-44 romp. Kazlausky, 
meanwhile, contributed a 
workmanlike eight points 
against Marengo and broke 
into double-digits against 
Grayslake, scoring 12. 

Maple said his team had 
set 20 wins as a team goal 
when practice started in 
November, but admitted he 
was surprised that the team 
earned the coveted mark so 
early. 

The impressive mark, 20-2 
overall, 11-0 in league play, 
means Grant entered this 
week's games with an op- 
portunity to lock up a league 
championship for the first 
time since 1981-82. Grant 
hosts lowly Wauconda Feb. 
20. 

"Winning the conference 
would allow us to sit back 
and relax and prepare-- for 
regionals. Ever since we 
started to play well, every 
game has been a pressure 
game for the players,"

said. 

The Wauconda win im- 
proved Round Lake's record 
to 12-9 overall, 5-6 in league 
play. 

Earlier, Round Lake had

Kichford had 18 points to 
compliment McDonald's hot 
outside shooting. 

In Grayslake, the Bulldogs 
were facing a team that 
played it closed for 33 
minutes the first time 
around before losing. Grant, 
though, was just too much 
for the undermanned Rams 
this time out. After a 12-10 
first-quarter lead, Grant put 
the game away with an 18-7 
dominance in the second 
period. 

Kazlausky and McDonald 
combined for 24 points from 
the guard spot. Kichford also 
had 12 and Kiesgan 10. 

Pat LuPori led Grayslake 
with 11 points. 'f* 

The Rams will be hoping to 
get back into the win column 
when they face Johnsburg in 
an away game Feb. 19. 

Grayslake trails John- 
sburg by one game heading 
into this week's action for 
fifth place. Johnsburg lost a 
close 56-53 decision to 
Marengo last week. 

Round Lake coach Bob 
Ward, meanwhile, is 
probably happy his Panthers 
are finished with the 
league's top teams - Grant, 
Lake Zurich and Marengo 
for the regular season. 
Round Lake lost to the three 
teams six times, but bounced 
back from the latest defeat 
to thump Wauconda. 

Round Lake won handily 
80-45, jumping out to a 22-9 
lead after one quarter and 
not looking back. Jim Bills 



suffered a tough 62-60 
overtime loss to Lake 
Zurich. In that game, Round 
Lake won the fourth quarter 
18-13 to force the overtime 
but the Bears prevailed in 
the extra session 4-2. 



Gymnast 
Nets Best 

Chris Pekelsma of Third 
Lake is contributing to the 
success of the Winona State 
University gymnastics 
team. 

Peklesma, a senior, 
earned a second on the vault 
with a career best 8.9 in the 
Warriors' last meet. 

Winona beat the 
University of Wisconsin-La 
Crosse Roonies 134.95-127.30 
to up their dual meet record 
to 4-0.

Up For Two 

Antioch's Paul Anderson 
goes up for two In North

action, antioch travels to 
Zion-Benton Feb. 20 and 
Warren Feb. 21 . 



Hungry 

To satisfy its huge ap- 
petite, the elephant spends 
up to 18 hours a day eating. 



As far as Dennis Kessel is 
concerned, Mundelein's 
second season started 
shortly after Lake Forest 
crunched the Mustangs 81-59 
to wrap up the North 
Suburban Conference title 
last week. 

"We're going to approach 
the final week as though it is 
Nov. 10 and we are starting 
all over again," Kessel said. 

Internal team problems 
coupled with going up 
against the NSC's top" club 
made It a rough week for 
Mundelein, now 8-14 overall 
and 6-9 in league play. 
Kessel is hoping the second 
season starts out on the right 
foot for Mundelein when the 
Mustangs travel to Liber- 
tyville Feb. 20, a team that 
Mundelein beat in round one. 
The Mustangs then host 
North Chicago Feb. 21 before 
closing out the regular 
season at Fenton Feb. 24. 

"Friday night's game will 
be a big test for us. We will 
see if we can pull together as 
a team. Sometimes you have 
to hit rock bottom before you 
pull together," Kessel said. 

The "rock bottom" Kessel 
was referring to came when 
he benched season-long 
starters Joe Wiener and Jeff 
Geary for the first half of the 
Lake Forest game. Kessel 
said the benching was due to 
"violation of a team rule" . 

Kessel said he hopes 
positives will come from the 
incident. 



"I hope we grew up as a 
team tonight," Kessel said. 

The absence of Wiener and 
Geary may not have 
provided enough for the final 
outcome, but the first half 
probably would' have had 
more Mundelein offense, 
Going with a small lineup 
against Lake Forest's tall 
rcbounders, Mundelein 
could manage few offensive 
rebounds and only three 
first-half baskets. 

Still, the hosts stayed 
realtively even with the 
league champs through the 
first 12 minutes or so of the 
first half. Five-of-six free- 
throw shooting by Mun- 
.delein's J. T. Mathwig {the 
team's leading scorer with 
15 points) help keep the first 
quarter deficit down to 16-10. 

Lake Forest exploded in 
the second quarter, though, 
holding Mundelein without a 
basket until Dave Sundall 
sank one at the buzzer. 
Kessel said it was a stretch 
in the second quarter which 
nailed Mundelein's fate. 

"We had four good 
chances. to cut the lead to 
eight, but we missed them 
and they got it up to 14," 
Kessel said. 

Lake Forest, now 20-2 
overall and a perfect 15*0 in 
NSC play, led 37-20 at 
haUtimc and 63-35 after 
three. Lake Forest coach 
Tom Meyers pulled his 
starters halfway through the 
third quarter.

Win Regional Titles 



Paces 
Warren 



by STEVE PETERSON 
Sports Editor 

When Warren Twp. High school students 
return to their spanking-new Gurnee campus 
in the fail, there will be something new in the 
sports trophy case as well. 

A polished looking, bright trophy proudly 
declaring the Blue Devils' girls basketball 
team as 1987 regional champions at 
Waukegan West will be available for all to 
admire. 

Warren's girls team has been waiting 
longer for the coveted trophy than the rest of 
the Student body has been waiting for its 
return to Gurnee. Warren's 61-54 upset win 
over Waukegan West Feb. 13 propelled the 
Devils to this week's Round Lake sectional - 
Warren's first sectional appearance in the 
sectional round. 

"We'd always get to the regional final but 
lose," Warren coach Bruce Campbell said as 
his team celebrated. 

Warren's win over the Raiders provided 
the Blue Devils with sweet revenge. 
Waukegan West eliminated Warren in 
ovetime last year in the first regional game, 

Campbell said his team, 18-8 going into the 
secional action, 'has regained the intensity it 
enjoyed at the start of the year. 

"In the two games in the regional, we 
played like we did at the start of the season. 
We had a stretch at the end of January, 
where we did not play well," he said. 

Campbell's team used an effective 
balanced scoring attack to knock off the 
Raiders and their one-dimensional offense of, 
Jackie Ray. Ray scored 27 points, but 20 
came in the first half. 

Warren, meanwhile, had four players in 
double figures. Senior Lisa Gowe had 18 
points to lead the way while Crystal Cobb had 
14, Tiffany Holmes 12 and Terrj Ingal Is 10. 

"The seniors did a real good job. That was 
Tiffany's best game," Campbell said. 

Warren jumped off to a 20-14 lead after 
one, getting the ball inside and capitalizing 
on fast-break opportunities. Ray had 10 of 
her team's 14 points. 

Waukegan West closed the gap in the 
second quarter and tied the game at 24 all on 
a Ray basket. 

Warren then went on a key 10-2 spree, 
getting' two hoops from Cobb and one each 
from Gowe, Dawn Bendery and Holmes for a 
34-26 half time lead. 

It looked as though Warren's lead could be 
in jeopardy early in the final quarter, as 
Warren committed six turnovers in the first 
seven minutes. 

But free-throw shooting, a year-long 
dilemma for Warren, suddenly became a 
saving grace in the final seconds. 

Cobb converted on two chances for a 58-52 
lead with 2:34 to go. Jenny Marker, who had 
not scored a point in the game, hit one of two 
for a 59-54 lead with :34 left. Ingalls iced the 
win with two free throws with six seconds 
left. 




Sequoits 
Discover 
Magic 



February madness? 

As far as Antioch and Warren's girls teams 
are concerned, the change to an early 
tournament is just fine. 

That's because the Sequoits and the Blue 
Devils had all the right ingredients in their 
two regionals - Warren winning at Waukegan 
West and Antioch taking home the Grayslake 
title.

Sequoits Win Title 

Antloch's Julie Sexton (30, first photo) tries to drive past Grant's Cherrie Miller and 
Chris Bochniok. Second photo: Sequoits celebrate regional title win. — Photos by 
Steve Young. 




Both teams advanced to this week's Round 
Lake Sectional. Round Lake's sectional final 
is l?eb. 19 with the winner advancing to the 
Dundee- Crown Supersectional. 

"We believe we can play with anybody," 
Antioch coach Harold Abramson said after 
the Sequoits destroyed Grant 76-55. 

The Sequoits appear to have regained their 
early-season form. They came into , the 
Grayslake tournament winning their last two 
of three North Suburban Conference games 
and by winning handly in the two regional 
lilts, have now won four of five. 

"We're playing more like we did at the 
start of the season. We had an 88-point game 
in a tournament. Then we had a mid-season 
slump for six or seven games but now the 
kids are starting to play better," Abramson 
said. 

Abramson said his team values its senior 
leadership of high scorer Julie Sexton, Linda 
Sexton and Debbie Sigler. The trio had 19, 18 
and 19 points respectively in the game 
against the Bulldogs. 

"Julie has been on the varsity for four 
years, Debbie and Linda have played for 
three years. They've done real well," 
Abramson said. 

Grant came out in the regional final like it 
had upset on its mind. Playing one of its best 
quarters of the year, Grant led 22-18 after 
one. Kathy Loring, who led Grant with 22 
points, scored eight in the first eight minutes. 

But when the second quarter started, 
Grant's season all but ended. 

"We had a poor second quarterf We just 
did not run our offense well tonight. We tried 
to run with them and- gave them too many 
fast-break baskets," Grant coach Sue 
Richardson said. 

Grant committed eight turnovers in the 
pivotal second quarter - 13 for the first half. 
Antioch ran up a 20-4 romp in the second 
period to take a commanding 38-26 lead at 
half time. 

Still, the season can be considered a 
success for the Bulldogs. Richardson's team 
finished at 13-12, its first winning season in at 
least five years. Grant was 11-3 in Northwest 
Suburban Conference play, finishing second 
in the league. 



Coxon Scores 500th Point, But Grant Ousts Grayslake 



by STEVE PETERSON 

Sports Editor 

It was just seconds after Grayslake's girls 
basketball team's season had ended. 

The Rams lost a heartbreaker, 49-48 to 
Grant in the opening round of their own 
regional. Lisa Coxon, the Rams' leading all- 
time scorer, sat alone on the team's bench. 
Coxon had played her last high school 
basketball game. 

"She's taking it pretty hard," Grayslake 
coach Brad Larson said. 

Earlier, Coxon had eclisped the 500 point 
total for the season, scoring on a baseline 
jumperin the second quarter. Coxon finished 
with 17 points on the night and 515 for the 
year. AH, told, Coxon has scored 900 points ■ 
the last two years for the Rams. 

Opposing coaches know if you are going to 
stop Grayslake, then you will have to stop 
Coxon. 

"To beat Grayslake, you have to stop Lisa 
Coxon," Grant coach Sue Richardson said. 

Thursday, February 19, 1987 



When Coxon scored point No. 500, the game 
was going in the hosts favor. Grayslake's 1-3- 
l zone was giving Grant fits, as the Bulldogs 
could not get the ball inside. 

Grayslake, taking advantage of six tur- 
novers by Grant in the second quarter, led 31- 
18 at half time. 

But Grant made enough adjustments in the 
second half to prevail. The Bulldogs were led 
by Kerry Wilson, one of two seniors on the 
squad, who scored 26 poinls. 

Grant trimmed Grayslake's lead to 37-33 
after three. Grant gained a 43-42 lead when 
Wilson tapped home a miss with 3:03 left in 
thegame. 

Grant opened up a four-point cushion when 
Chris Bochniak scored on a fastbreak layup 
with 58 seconds left, making it 47-43. Coxon, 
who was ll-for-20 from the free-throw line, 
made two to trim the margin, to two with :14 
left. 

A Bochniak free throw with :12 iced the 
win for the Bulldogs. ^_ 



Grayslake, which finished the year at 11- 
14, scored with : 6 on a hoop by Aaron Stey. 

Although it was her final high school game, 
Larson said Coxon will likely be get offers to 
play college ball. 

"She's a very coachable kid. She'll do 
anything you ask," Larson said. 

Coxon, in her senior season, was an all- 
Northwest Suburban Conference unanimous 
pick "leading the league in points scored. 

"She's a heckuva player. I've seen Jackie 
Ray of Waukegan West and she matches up 
with Ray well. I've enjoyed coaching her," 
Larson said. - 

Also playing in their last game for 
Grayslake were seniors Lisa Richardson and 
Diane Cesaroni. 

"Coxon, Richardson and Cesaroni have 
scored 1,900 points over the past two years. 
They've been super players and I really 
appreciate it," Larson said. 

In the other first round game, Antioch had 
little trouble against Round Lake, winning 
54-34. 



The Sequoits struggled early, but gained a 
12-6 lead after oner 

Then they exploded' for 23 points in the 
second quarter, putting the" game away with 
a 35-17 half time lead. They did with defense, 
as three starters were out with foul trouble. 

"Our bench plays fairly well. We can go 
eight or nine deep. The bench players are 
more defensive orincted," Antioch coach 
Harold Ambrason said. , 

Kristin Morgan led Antioch with 15 points 
while Debbie Sigler had 10. 

Dawn Steger score 19 for the Panthers in 
the losing cause. 

Antioch enjoyed a 37-26 rebounding edge, 
including 18 on the offensive end. Antioch 
made 21-for-56 shots from the field. 

Elsewhere in girls tournaments, 
Wauconda had its season ended by Fox 
Valley Conference champion Cary-Grove 54- 
34. Carmel beat host Mundclein 68-56 but lost 
to Cary-Grove in the regional final 63-41.

American Bold Eagles Winter At Reelfoot Lake 



The swallows return to 
Capistrano, the buzzards to 
Hinckley, Ohio, and the 
eagles to Tennessee's 
Reelfoot Lake. 

Each year a hundred or 
more majestic American 
bald eagles, with wingspans 
of six to eight feet and 
weighing as much as 16 
pounds, follow the wind 
currents south from their 
summer homes around the 
Great Lakes and in Canada 
to spend the winter months 
near the warmer, ice-free 
waters of northwestern 
Tennessee, 

The eagles are among 
thousands of migrating 



birds-ducks, Canada geese, 
coots and an occasional toon- 
-spending much of the winter 
in this strangely beautiful 
• and peaceful place. 

The large number of 
eagles at Reelfoot has made 
"eagle-watching" a major 
winter activity for thousands 
of visitors, a fact which has 
led the Tennessee Dept. of 
Conservation to establish an 
extensive eagle-watching 
program at Reelfoot Lake 
State Resort Park. 

"The interest in the eagles 
gets bigger every year," 
says park superintendent 
Ralph Burrus. "Last year 
the park hosted more than 



12,000 people during the 
eagle season which 
generally lasts until mid- 
March when the eagles Hy 
north again. During the 
winter months, Reelfoot 
Lake has perhaps the 
highest concentration of bald 
eagles east of the Mississippi 
River." 

For the eagles, the chief 
attraction is fish. 

Reelfoot Lake has long 
been known as one of the 
world's greatest natural fish 
hatcheries and commercial 
fishing on the shallow lake is 
extensive. 

"Eagles are usually very 
shy birds," Burrus says,

Eagles Landing 

Annual gathering of eagles at Reelfoot Lake in Tiptonville, Tenn., brings thousands 
of visitors each winter for 'Eagle Tours' conducted daily through mid-March by park 
naturalists at Reelfoot Lake State Resort Park.

"but they have come to 
recognize some of the 
commercial fishermen. 
When they cast their nets, 
the eagles will sometimes 
actually hover around the 
boa'ts waiting for them to 
discard the fish they can't 
use- If there is a stranger on 
the boat, though-someonc 
the eagles don't recognize- 
they usually won't come 
anywhere close. It's as if the 
eagles know who they can 
trust." 

Airpark Inn, Reelfoot ! s 
small resort hotel and 
restaurant built on pilings 
out into the shallow lake, is a 
prime eagle-watching area, 
and the originating point for 
guided bus tours conducted 
by state park naturalists. 
The tours begin daily at 10 
a.m. and visitors are urged 
to make advance reser- 
vations by calling (901) 253- 
7756. There is a 50 cent 
charge and visitors are 
urged to dress warmly and 
bring binoculars, telescopes 
and telcphoto lenses for their 
cameras. . 



"For most people there is 
a temptation to get as close 
as possible for theat really 
great photograph," Burrus 
explains. "The eagle usually 
gels spooked and flics off, 
and the photographer not 
only misses his picture, he 
also risks a federal charge of 
harassment." 

The federal laws 
protecting an endangered 
species are strict. The 
maximum" punishment for 
killing or molesting an eagle, 
carries a $5,000 fine and the 
possibility of a one-year 
prison sentence. 

The park's eagle program 
also includes orientation 
sessions on Friday and 
Saturday nights at Airpark 
Inn. The programs, which 
feature guest speakers and 
films, also give visitors an 
instight into the unique 
history and biology of 
Reelfoot Lake. 

"The lake was created by 
earthquakes during the 
winter of 1811 and 1812," 
Burrus ' explains. "The 
tremors climaxed on Feb. 7, 



1812, with what was probably 
the most violent earthquake 
ever to strike the North 
American- continent. This 
whole land area in nor- 
thwestern Tennessee sank as 
much as 20 feet. There were 
tidal waves on the 
Mississippi River, and the 
river flowed backward to fill 
the depression we know 
today as Reelfoot Lake." 

The National Wildlife 
Refuge headquarters, 
located off State Hwy. 22 on 
the eastern side of the lake, 
features a small museum 
with excellent exhibits of the 
Reelfoot wildlife and refuge . 
officials will conduct tours 
for groups with advance 
notice. The refuge 
headquarters may be con- 
tacted by calling (901) 538- 
2481.

Bruce Springsteen's Tire' 
clip burns with raw energy 



By Barton Weiss 

Among many other 
things, Bruce Springsteen 
has been credited with re- 
defining and bringing back 
the ballad as viable pop- 
music form, and "Fire," a 
Springsteen composition 
that was a major hit for the 
Pointer Sisters a few years 
back, is one of Spring- 
steen's best. 




Bruce Springsteen 



Video viewers currently 
are being treated to a live 
Springsteen version of 
"Fire." And what a live 
video! 

Springsteen is in top 
form. Instead of using the 
full band, he goes acous- 
tic, using two guitars and 
— the brilliant stroke — 
an accordion. The accor- 
dion doesn't sound that 
different from an electron- 
ic keyboard, but its pres- 
ence ties the song to the 
balladeer tradition. 

Then there's , Spring- 
steen's performance itself. 
This is the best he's ever 
been on videotape. The 
clip has passion, control 
and raw sex appeal, What 
else could you ask for in 
three minutes? 

From the movies 

Most movie music vid- 



eos miss their mark be- 
cause they don't quite un- 
derstand the energy and 
language of clipdom. But 
the video from "Little 
Shop of Horrors" is 
different. 

In a sense, the entire 
movie is an elaborate mu- 
sic video, and this is espe- 
cially true of the song they 
chose for video form — 
"Dentist." with Steve Mar- 
tin. If they simply had lifted 
it right out of the film, It 
would have been far supe- 
rior to the average video. 
But it Is made even better 
by a few added snippets 
from the film. 

Martin is wonderful as a 
sadistic dentist, and 
there's a nifty shot from in- 
side a mouth. 

Sophistication 
Natt Johnson, who has 
been going by the generic 
name The The, is one of 
those artists who does just 
about everything. He has 
made a clip for every song 
from his latest album, "In- 
fected." The result, "In- 
fected: The Movie," which 
has not yet been released 
as a home video but pre- 
sumably will be, is one of 
the most sophisticated 
music-video compilations 
ever. Instead of showing 
us how tough it is to be a 
rock star (the theme of 
most long-form videos), 
Johnson deals with subtle 
political issues that are 
usually neglected by the 
medium. 

Each clip is stylistically 
different (Johnson used 
several different direc- 
tors), but the intensity is 
there throughout, and 
Johnson's acting holds up.

RADIO DAYS (PG-Orion) Starring Mia Farrow, Julie Kavner, 
Michael Tucker. Diane Weist. * • • Vt* 



ByJ.T. YURKO 



Woody Allen's roots have 
been the direct source of 
much of his humor. In "Annie 
Hall," for instance, Allen (or 
Allen's character) visits the 
house where he was raised, 
which he swears was situated 
directly under the tracks of 
the Coney Island roller coast- 
er. Poor, frumpy and Jewish, 
the family consisted of a 
mother and father locked In 
an Incessant argument and a 
short, red-haired boy reading 
books about death and Jrying 
to discover the joys of sex. 

"Hannah and Her Sisters" 
was something of a turning 
point for Allen. By the end of 
the film, Allen actually re- 
solved some of his neuroses. 
Thinking he was going to die, 
he came face to face with life, 
and. emerged a happily mar- 
ried man with a child on the 
way. "Good heavens." said 
Allen fans, "now that he's 
happy, what will he make films 
about?" 

Allen has chosen to return 
to his childhood. He uses the 
golden days of radio as a met- 
aphor and memory stimulus In 
"Radio Days." 

Allen narrates the film, but' 
the Allen persona is played by 
Seth Green, a young red- 



haired boy. 

Like memory Images that 
often flash randomly Into 
mind, Allen presents a mosaic 
of places, characters and sto- 
ries with no 'single narrative 
thread. It's a combination of 
tales of the family household, 
with Julie Kavner playing the 
mother and Michael Tucker 
playing the father, and the ra- 
dio world. 

The characters of the radio 
world Include Mia Farrow as a 
cigarette girl trying to break 
into radio and Wallace 
Shawn, who doesn't bear the 
slightest resemblance to 
Christopher Reeve, as "The 
Masked Avenger." Such pos- 
sibilities existed only in radio, 
where the imagination 
reigned supreme and some- 
thing as potentially absurd as 
a ventriloquist on the radio 
was the top show for years. 

Then there's music, music, 
music, with enough Tommy 
Dorsey, Glenn Miller and Big" 
Band music to bring waves of 
nostalgia to anyone who lived 
through those times. This is 
Allen's own "Brighton Beach 
Memojrs" — a marvelousiy 
witty look at a time gone by.

Anne Schedeen 



TeleWaves 

What's 'ALF' really like? 
Frank talk from a co-star 

By Constance Pace 

So you think your co-workers are a pain! 

Pity poor Anne Schedeen 
who plays Kate Tanner, 
mother of a typical Ameri- 
can family visited by a wise- 
cracking alien from the 
planet Melmac. on NBC's 
"ALF." According to the 
tongue-in-cheek Schedeen. 
working with her co-star 
ALF isn't exactly a celestial 
experience. 

"How do I like working 
with an alien?" she says. "I 
have to admit it's not the ful- 
fillment of a lifelong dream. 
He's difficult, he's cranky, he's temperamental, and 
he's pretty pushy on the set. And he hasn't exactly had a 
lot of stage training, although I did hear he had a one- 
man show on Melmac called 'Harry Truman: The Early 
Years.' 

"He doesn't know the niceties." she continues. "He'll 
call a three-hour lunch and belt a few, and then the whole 
afternoon is wasted. And he sheds all over the set." 

Seriously, Schedeen loves working on "ALF." "When I 
read the pilot script, I said, 'This really Is funny,' so I'm 
not surprised people like it," she says. "And as more and 
more people are discovering us. I think we're just on the 
edge of becoming a big hit." 

Schedeen was raised in Oregon, and alter college and 
a period doing commercials in New York City, she moved 
to Los Angeles, where she was one of Universale lasl 
contract players before the studio's contract system was 
phased out. Although she has enjoyed appearing on 
such sitcoms as "Cheers" and "Three's Company" (in 
addition to a nicely played role on ABC's defunct night- 
time soap "Paper Dolls"), she feels "ALF" is special. 
"You never know what you're going to find In the 
scripts," she says. "We just had a show where ALF had a 
seance and there's one where he gets amnesia and 
thinks he's an insurance agent. On the set.'we just laugh 
and laugh. ALF might be a pain, but he's got a great 
sense of humor. 

"This weekend, ALF was looking forward to the two of 
us taking a romantic" ski trip together," she confesses. 
"But I had to explain to him I'm married (to a Hollywood 
agent). We'll have to see how it goes at work next week. I 
don't know whether he'll be ticked off or what."

Federal Tax Return Processing Steps 



Truckloads of tax returns arrive for processing at 

each of the ten IRS Service Centers nationwide. 

The service centers received 178 million lax returns 

in 1986. Returns arriving in the coded envelopes 

from tax packages are processed faster, which may speed-up 

refund processing. The coding allows IRS to use its 

electronic mail processing system 

to sort envelopes by type ol 

return and identify which 



. ^&gt;. „^ a r Rncooniiton (OCR) equipment scans certain returns 
Optical Character RecognwrMv^rt, wyn^ ^^ ioaOEZ. ^ ^^ ^^ ..^^ 

the returns and tax information is entered directly 
into the computer. 




EmoHjyens at "ling's la^es." "*&lt;"** ,ot 
inventor Jim Tingle, then further hand-sort 
tax relums by category. Returns with paymenis 
are separated so that the paymenis are 
immediately credited to the taxpayers" accounts 
IRS deposits checks every day. 




Tax examiners review 
returns containing errors, 
correct them and then enter 
the corrected information 
-directly into the computer. 



lata Transcribers 

enter Information from the returns into 

the computer. Their input is verified and 

then placed on magnetic lape lor lurther processing. 

Returns with the peel-off label Irom lax packages are much 

easier to input and transcription errors are less likely to be 

&gt;nade. These labels help 
up refund processing. 



&lt;! Reiurns are put in blocks of 100 
and then each relurn is given a unique 
document locaior number. The document 
numbers enable IRS employees 10 tocate 
the returns no mailer where they are 
within the processing workflow. 



Employees make sure 
returns which are not optically 
scanned contain the required 
signatures, are filted-in and have 
all forms attached. Returns * 
which are not complete will be' 
held from further processing while 
taxpayers are contacted to 
provide the missing information. 
Employees then code the * 
completed returns for further 
processing. 



Once all the information on the 
magnetic lape is determined lo be 
correct, workers send the tapes to the 
National Computer Center (NCC) in 
Martin5burg. West Virginia tor final 
processing. 





NCC generates tapes containing 
refund information. These refund 
tapes are sent to disbursing' centers 
throughout the country whero refund checks 
are printed and mailed.

Lakeland's Tax Guide, 
Seminar Offer Help 



This week, lo help tax 
payers get through the maze 
of new regulations in the 
federal tax laws, Lakeland 
Newspapers is publishing a 
12-page tax guide. 

While the impact of tax 
reform legislation will not be 
felt until next year's returns 
arc filled out, taxpayers will 
have to start planning now to 
avoid being caught by 
surprise. 

In addition to the tax guide 
being published this week, 
the Lakeland group of 
newspapers, in cooperation 
with the Internal Revenue 
Service, will host a seminar 
on federal income taxes on 
Wednesday, Feb. 25, starting 
at 7 p.m. in a seminar room 
at the College of Lake 
County in Grayslake. 

Open to all interested 
parties, IRS Agent Sallie 
Coding will speak for aboul 



an hour and a half before 
opening up the floor to 
questions from the audience. 

"The changes will affect 
almost everyone," she said. 
"The new law abolishes the 
deduction for a married 
couple when both . work. 
Rules for IRAs have 
changed drastically and 
there are many changes in 
itemized deductions." 

While Coding said she 
would not be giving advice 
on tax planning, she said she 
would give information on 
what has changed and how it 
will affect taxpayers. She 
will offer advice on how to 
f il I out the new W-4 Forms. 

Coding has been a revenue 
agent out of the Schaumburg 
office since 1980, She works 
in auditing of large com- 
panies and is a certified 
public accountant. 



Quarterly Taxes 
Due April 15 Also 



The first installment of 
1987 estimated federal in- 
come tax payments by in- 
diviudals other than farmers 
and fishermen is due by 
April 15, 1987. 

Generally, taxpayers must 
pay estimated tax if they 
expect to owe, after 
withholding and credits, at 
least $500 in tax for 1987, and 
they expect their 
withholding to be less than 
the lesser of: 

-90 percent of the tax 
shown on their 1987 tax 
return; or 

' -100 percent of the tax 
shown on their 1986 tax 
return. 

Form 1040-ES, Estimated 
Tax for Individuals, must be 
filed. 

Single social security 
recipients whose total in- 
come for 1987, including half 
of their social security -in- 
come, is expected to be more 
than $25,000 and married 



social security recipients 
who expect their joint in- 
come, including half of the 
social security income, to 
exceed $32,000 may have to 
pay tax on part of their 
social security income. 
Therefore, they may need to 
file and pay estimated tax; 

The Form 1040-ES 
package, containing in- 
structions, a tax worksheet 
and four payment vouchers, 
will be sent to those tax- 
payers who Hied estimated 
tax last year. Also, 1040-ES 
forms are stocked at some 
local IRS offices. 

The IRS also has a free 
reference Publication 505, 

Tux WUhhuhlinfi mttl E*timatrtl 

Tax, which provides in- 
formation about paying 
estimated tax. The 
publication may be ordered 
using the handy order form- 
in the tax forms package or 
by calling the IRS toll-free 
number.

"Even though I will be

make room in that for in-

point is not clear. For in- 
dividuals who have 
questions beyond what will 
be discussed in the regular 
session, I will stay after and 
discuss it with them in-

Lakeland Publisher 
William H. Schroeder noted 
that the public does not often 
have the chance to speak lo 
an IRS agent in a give and 
take situation. "This 
seminar will give people that 
opportunity," he said. 

This is the second year 
that Lakeland has sponsored 
the program as a. public

other interested persons. 
Admission is free. 

Lakeland believes that this 
public service is of vital

With the success of last

tax Law Changes Tarnish Luster Of IRAs For Some 



by PETER SCHATZ 
Transamerica Lire Com- 
panies 

He or she who hestitates 
will definitely lose out this 
tax season in the individual 
retirement plan arena. 

Once hearlded as one of 
the most innovative 
retirement planning tools of 
the 1980s, IRAs are un- 
dergoing a transformation of 
sorts that may make them 
less attractive to you in the 
future. But all IRA ad- 
vantages will remain intact 
on your 1986 tax return. And 
despite frequent talk of the 
IRA's demise, the reshaped 
-IRA will still offer some 
excellent financial planning 
opportunities in the years 
that follow. 

To better understand the 
pros and cons of the IRA 
situation, let's take a brief 
look at its short history. 
Government statistics, in- 
dicate that more than 33 
million households have 
accumulated $260 billion in 
IRAs since they were made 
available to all wage earners 
only five years ago. But that 
figure is not surprising 
considering why access to 
them was expanded in 1981. 

The principle behind the 
expansion of IHA 
availability was to allow 
every working person to take 
an immediate income tax 
deduction of up to $2,000 
annually or ' $2,250 for 
couples with one non- 
working spouse. At the same 
time, the interest on these 
accounts was to accumulate 
lax deferred until with- 
drawn. 

But 1986 is the last tax year 
the description of an IRA 
will be as simple and as 
unquestionably appealing. 
The tax legislation that 



President Reagan signed in 
October contains some 
-definite .restrictions .about 
who can take the fullest 
advantage of the IRA tax 
break. 

On the positive side, all 
working people may con- 
tinue to contribute up to 
$2,000 annually or $2,250 for 
spousal IRAs. Additionally, 
the $2,000 ($2,250 for spousal 
IRAs} deduction is retained 
for all employees who dp not 
■ actively participate in a 
qualified retirement, 
Simplified Employee 
Pension (SEP), 403(b) or 
government plan. Likewise, 
employees who are covered 
by one of these plans but 
have adjusted gross incomes 
of less than $25,000 on single 
returns and $40,000 on joint 
returns also retain their full 
deduction privileges. 

Partial deductions 
determined on a pro rata 
basis will be allowed for 
individuals covered by a 
retirement plan who earn 
between $25,000 and $35,000, 
and those filing joint returns 
with income between $40,000 
and $50,000. A married 
worker with an adjusted 
gross income of $45,000, for 
instance, would be limited to 
a deduction of $1,000. 
Covered individuals and 
couples who earn more than 
$35,000 or $50,000 respec- 
tively and are active par- 
ticipants, would be allowed 
to contribute to an IRA up to 
the permitted amounts, but 
not on a tax deductible basis. 
So what are your best 
moves if the full IRA 
deduction is moving far 
away from your reach? 

To start with, if you do not 
have an IRA yet, hurry up 
and fill out an application for 
one while the deduction 



Deduct/on For 
Working Couples 



Married couples who both 
work are eligible for a 
special deduction of as much 
as $3,000 on 1986 federal tax 
returns. This deduction may 
be claimed on either Form 
1040 or 1040A as a sub- 
traction from gross income. 
. The deduction is limited to 
10 percent of the qualified 
earned income of the lesser- 
earning spouse. However, 
the maximum allowed is 10 
percent of up to $30,000 for a 
deduction of $3,000. To take 
the deduction, both spouses 



must have earned income, 
such as wages, salaries and 
tips. However, income 
earned by one spouse 
working for another, does not 
qualify; nor does such in- 
come as interest, dividends, 
pensions, annuities, IRA 
distributions, unem- 
ployment compensation, 
deferred compensation or 
nontaxable income. 

More complete in- 
formation is contained in the 
tax forms instructions for 
Forms 1040 and 1040A.

potential is optimal. And if 
you do hive one, plan on 
making the &gt;. maximum 
contribution to it by April 15, 
1987. 

As far as 1987 and the 
years beyond that are 
concerned, most financial 
planners agree that you 
should continue to make the 
maximum contribution to 
your IRA' for two striking 
reasons. The first is the fact 
that IRA earnings remain 
tax deferred. This is ex- 
tremely beneficial because 
the base on which your yield 
is compounded will not be 
reduced over the years by 
any taxes. For example, if 
you open a $2,000 IRA 
tomorrow that earns eight 
percent annually, you would 
have $9,332 in 20 years. But, 



if the government took 28 
percent in taxes away from 
.you each year, your in- 
vestment would be worth 
only about $6,130. In order to 
simplify the example, the 
tax which would be due on 
the final sums has been 
ignored. But as you can see, 
you can accumulate quite a 
bit more, quite a bit faster on 
a tax : deferred basis. 

The second is ah ob- 
servation by financial 
planners that most people 
included in retirement plans 
have a substantial need for 
supplementary retirement 
savings. In fact, nearly half 
of the 38 million employees 
covered by pension plans 
were not vested at the close 
of 1986. Since many workers 
leave their jobs long before 



becoming, vested, IRAs 
could, prove to be an ex- 
cellent source for retirement 
dollars. 

And there are still other 
advantages. IRAs also will 
become a more powerful 
magnet for lump-sum 
distributions from company 
pension . or profit-sharing 
plans. Many times, when an 
employee leaves or retires 
form a corporation, he or she 
receives a single check for 
the pension dollars which 
have accumulated. Prior to 
tax reform, these 
distributions may have 
qualified for 10-year forward 
averaging. Under this 
method, you paid tax at a 
much lower rate. However, 
the 10-year forward 
averaging opportunity 



remains.f or. only, those who 
turned 50\ years old before 
Jan! 1, 1986. It was replaced 
with five-year averaging, 
which is' generally less 
favorable. In .addition, 
favorable capital gains 
treatment which wa,s 
previously available will be 
phased out. So most em- 
ployees younger than that 
would be wise to rollover 
their lump sums into IRAs to 
avoid paying taxes. 

So as you can see, IRAs 
remain an atractive savings 
vehicle. Although they may 
not remain everybody's 
favorite tax break, they still 
have the potential to insure 
that our retirement years 
are characterized by 
financial health and well- 
being.

Interest On U.S. 
Bonds Taxable 



Interest on U.S. Savings 
Bonds is taxable income and 
must be reported on federal 
income tax returns. 

Taxpayers must report the 
interest from Series E and 
EE bonds in one of two 
ways: annually, as it ac- 
crues, or when the bond is 
cashed or reaches final 
maturity. 

In the case of Series H and 
HH Bonds, however, interest 
payments are made twice a 



year and must be reported in 
the year received. 

Those taxpayers who buy 
U.S. Savings Bonds as co- 
owners with their children 
are liable for the tax on the 
interest earned on the bonds. 
Interest on U.S. Savings 
Bonds bought in the name of 
a child is income to the child, 
even if the taxpayer pays for 
them and is named as 
beneficiary. 



Tax Return Copies 
Are Useful Records 



Copies of federal income 
tax returns from prior years 
not only serve as good 
financial records, but they 
can serve as guidelines for 
filling out future returns as 
well, the Internal Hevenue 
Service says. 

A good deal of information 
may be utilized from old 
copies, especially for those 
taxpayers whose financial 
situations stay almost the 
same from year to year, 
according to the IRS. 

Being able to refer to 



^completed returns could also 
be helpful to those who might 
later wish to amend their 
returns, income average, or 
who are called in for a tax 
examination. Taxpayers 
finding themselves in any of 
these situations will be glad 
they retained a copy of their 
return. 

Requesting copies of prior 
returns can be very time 
consuming and costly, 
depending on the contents of 
the documents requested. 



Taxpayers May Extend 
Deadline Fpr Filing 



Preparing an income tax 
return can require a 
multitude of information 
papers such as cancelled 
checks, receipts, and proof 
of earnings and expenses. 
Sometimes copies of certain 
information papers must be 
obtained and are not 
received in time to prepare 
the return and meet the 
filing deadline. 
• Form 1040 or 1 040 A filers 
can request an automatic 
four-month extension of time 
to file their tax returns, the 
Internal Revenue Service 
says. 

However, the IRS adds 
that this is not an extension 
to pay taxes owed. 

To obtain the four-month 
extension beyond April 15, 
1987, a taxpayer must 



complete Form 4868, Ap- 
plication for Automatic 
Extension of Time To File 
U.S. Individual Income Tax 
Return, and forward it to the 
service center processing 
tax returns for his or her 
state. Form 4B68 must be 
filed on or before April 15, 
1987. 

On Form 4868, one must 
make a tentative estimate of 
the year's taxes and submit 
tfhy balance due with the 
form. Upon filing the tax 
return, if the unpaid tax is 
more than 10 percent, there 
is a penalty for late payment 
unless the taxpayer can 
show reasonable cause for 
not paying the tax when due. 
The penalty is one-half of one 
percent per month on the 
unpaid balance, up to a 
maximum of 25 percent. 



Medical Deductions 

Allowable medical deductions include costs of special 
equipment-such as a motorized" wheelchair, hand controls on 
a car, a special telephone for the deaf-and special items, 
such as false teeth, artificial limbs, eyeglasses, hearing aids, 
crutches and guide dogs for the blind or deaf. More in- 
formation can be found in the free IRS Publication 502,

Taxpayers Over 55 May Exclude Home Sale Gain 

1 / „ „ : „^ „ tnvnnvnr venrs from the date the tax tin,,,* nna iws e&gt;,»~ «... 



A once-in-a-Hfetime 
$125,000 exclusion of gain on 
the sale of a home is 
available to taxpayers who 
are 55 or older, the Internal 
Revenue Service says. 

To qualify, taxpayers 
must be 55 years or older on 
the date of the sale of their 
home. The home must have 
been owned and lived in as 



the principal residence for at 
least three years out of the 
five-year period ending on 
the date of sale, and the. gain 
on the sale of a home after 
July 26, 1978, must never 
have been previously ex- 
cluded by the taxpayer or 
his/her spouse. 

A principal residence is 
the home owned and lived in. 



whether it be a houseboat, 
mobile home, condominium, 
apartment or house. If a 
taxpayer owns two homes 
and lives in both, the prin- 
cipal residence is the one 
resided in most of the time. 

The gain is the selling 
price'of the residence minus 
selling expenses and the 
adjusted basis of the home. 




Good Tax Records 
Task Of Filing Returns 



Tax return preparation 
can be made easier, ac- 
cording to the Internal 
Revenue Service^ if tax- 
payers keep accurate and 
complete records. 

Taxpayers should keep the 
necessary records to 
prepare a complete and 
accurate income tax return 
for as long as their ocntents 
may be material in ad- 
ministering any Internal 
Revenue law. 

Records that support an 
item " of income or a 



deduction should be kept 
until the period of limitation 
for the return expires 
(generally three years from 
the date the return was filed, 
or two years from the date 
the lax was paid, whichever 
occurs later J 

Other records that concern 
income averaging or 
property transaclions (e.g. 
the purchase of a home) 
should be kept for as long as 
they are material. 

Copies of filed tax returns 
should be kept even after the 



cancelled checks, receipts 
and other records are 
disposed of, since they may 
be helpful in preparing 
future returns. They should 
be kept for at least Ihree 
years lo cover the base years 
figured in income averaging.

Tax Form Copies Available 
At Some Public Libraries 



A set of reproductible 
federal tax forms is 
available at many public 
libraries, the Internal 
Revenue Service said. 
Taxpayers needing a form 
which is not included in their 
federal income tax package 
may make a copy at a 
participating library. 

The IRS developed a 
Publication .1132, 



Hoftrtnluvjihif- Fvilvnil Tax 

Form* fur V*f in Mhritrii-x, in an 

effort to increase the 
public's accessibility to 
federal tax forms and 
schedules. This set of 
reproductibles contains a 
selection of individual and 
partnership tax forms, 
schedules and separate 
instructions. 
Although use of the 



reproductible forms is free, 
public libraries often require 

a nominal charge for making 
copies. 

Taxpayers can also obtain 
forms and schedules from 
many local banks and post 

offices in limited quantities, 
or they can be ordered by 
writing or calling the IRS.

If married, a taxpayer 
may not choose to exclude 
the gain unless the spouse 
joins in making the choice. 
However, if married and 
filing a separate return, a 
taxpayer may choose to 
exclude no more than $62,500 
of the gain. The decision to 
exclude the gain from a 
particular sale or exchange 
may be made or revoked at 
any time before the latest of: 
the due date or the tax return 
for the year of sale; three 
years from the date the

Homeowners should keep all records pertaining to the

the cost of many of these items can be used to increase their

sale of the home and any tax they may have to pay on the 
profits. More information is available in the free IKS

Avoid Common Error 
When Filing Form 1040 



Each year there are areas 
where large numbers of 
taxpayers make incorrect 
entries, slowing the 
processing of their tax 
forms, according to the 
Internal Revenue Service. 

These trouble spots fall 
into two broad categories: 
problems that recur each 
year, such as taxpayers 
selecting the incorrect figure 
from the tax tables; and 
problems that stem from 
changes in the tax laws and 
forms from one year, to the 
next, such as the addition of 
a new line to a form or the 
shift of an existing line to a 
new position on the form. 

Not surprisingly, .the 
largest percentage of errors 
is made on Form 1040, the so- 
called "long form." Toassist 
filers of this form, the IRS 
has compiled the following 
list of problem areas to 
double-check: 

1. Medical Deductions. 
This item is not entered on 
Form 1040, but on a related 
Schedule A. Because 
Schedule A was redesigned 
recently, and due to recent 
rule changes on medical 
deductions, IRS expects 
problems again this year. Be 
sure to check the limitation 
on medical expenses. 

2. Figure from Tax Table. 
Because of the number of 
pages and figures involved, 
this item is always high on 
the list of most common 
errors for all tax forms. 
Double-check the figure 
from the tax table for filing 
status and enter on line 38. 
Check the box for "Tax 
Table." 



3. Unemployment Com- 
pensation. Double-check 
figures on the worksheet in 
the tax instruction booklet 
page 10, and make ap- 
propriate entries on lines 20a 
andb. 

4. Child Care Credit. Read 
instructions carefully and 
double-check your com- 
putations on Form 2441, 
"Credit for Child and 
Disabled Dependent Care 
Expenses." Enter the figure 
on line 41 and attach Form 
2441 to your return, 

5. Balance Due Refund. 
This important item usually 
makes the list of most 
common errors. If your total 
tax (line 55) is larger than 
your total payments made 
(line 63) enter the difference 
on line G7, "Amount You 
Owe.'* Follow the in- 
structions for remitting 
payment. If the reverse is 
true, enter the difference on 
line 64, "Overpaid." Enter 
on line 65, "Refunded To 
You" the portion of the line 
64 overpayment that you 
want refunded to you. 

6. Earned Income Credit 
(EIC) Not Claimed. If you 
are a working parent and 
have at least one child living 
with you, and if your ad- 
justed gross income is less 
than $11,000, you probably 
qualify. See page. 16 of in- 
structions. 

7. EIC Error or Not 
Qualified. Make sure you are 
qualified. Certain ex- 
pectations must be met, and 
you must have a dependent 
child living with you and you 
must have worked during 
the year. Follow the in- 



structions carefully and 
enter on line 58. 

8. Dividends. You must 
complete and attach 
Schedule B if you have over 
$400 in dividend income. 
Enter your total dividends 
on line 9a; your exclusion 
(up to $100 for individual 
filers, up to $200 for married 
filing jointly) on line 9b; and 
enter the difference (sub- 
tract line 9b from 9a) on line 
9c. 

9. Income Computation. 
This is an outgrowth of item 
8, since the taxpayers who 
miscompute their dividend 
income will have an error on 
line 23, total income. Double- 
check these figures. 

10. Income Averaging. 
Schedule G, "Income 
Averaging," is one of the 
most difficult forms for 
individual filers, because of 
the number of tax years 
covered. You should have 
copies of returns for the 
preceding three years in 
order to accurately complete 
this form. Read and follow 
instructions carefully and 
double-check all figures.

According^ to IRS 
guidelines, all business

payer's line of work to be 



deductible. Reasonable local 
transportation expenses 
such as the cost of driving 
and maintaining an 
automobile while on 
buisiness, excluding any 
commuting and personal 
mileage, can be deducted. 

For a business-related trip 
outside the area of his or her 
main place of business, a 
taxpayer may deduct ex- 
penses such as food and 
lodging. Allowable en- 
tertainment deductions must 
either be directly related to, 
or associated with, the ac- 



tive pursuit of the taxpayers' 
business. Business gifts that 
the taxpayer may deduct are 

generally limited to $25 for 
any one individual for the 
year. The burden of proof for 

all business expenses lies 
with the taxpayer, who must 
show that a bonafide 



business purpose exists.

expenses can be found in the

Take Time, Avoid Errors 
When Preparing Tax Return 



. Filing a Form 1040, 1040A 
or even the 11-line Form 
1040EZ can be an ordeal if 
prepared in haste at the last 
minute. 

Through the years IRS has 
seen a trend in filing prac- 
tices. Some taxpayers file as 
soon as they receive their 
tax return packages and 
Forms W-2 and interest 
information notices. Others 
prefer to wait until the last 
minute when running shoes 
6&gt; are a necessity to ensure 
timely filing before midnight 
on April 15. 

However, those who wait 
until the last minute might 
find that preparing their 
returns earlier-even if only 
a week or a few days earlier- 
-could make a big difference. 
Preparing the return over a 
two or three week period will 
lessen the chances for 
mistakes as taxpayers will 
be more relaxed and take 
more time in completing the 
form and appropriate 
supporting schedules. 
Taking time in preparing an 
income tax return will 



reduce the possibility of 
making errors, and can help 
taxpayers discover credits 
or deductions for which they 
qualify and might have 
otherwise missed. 

Of course, many file close 
to the filing deadlines 
because they must wait for 
certain forms like Form W-2, 
Wage and Tax Statement, or 
Form 1099-INT, Statement 
for Recipients of Interest 
Income. 

The Internal Revenue 
Service advises these tax- 
payers, if they do not receive 
their statements by Jan. 31, 
to contact the employer or 
payer and request that the 
form be issued. 

Taxpayers who still have 
not received their Forms W- 
2 by Feb. 15 should call the 
IRS toll-free telephone 
number for their area. When 
contacting the IRS, tax- 
payers will be asked to 
provide the employer's 
name, address and em- 
ployer's identification 
number. Having the 
necessary information 



available on the first con- 
tact, IRS adds, will prevent 
the need for taxpayers to call 
again. 

Those waiting Tor Forms 
1099-INT should note that 
they should not attach this 
form to their completed 
returns. All that is required 
is the payment information 
from the forms; so if the 
taxpayer has kept accurate 
records or can get the in- 
formation from the issuing 
company, he or she can file 
without having received the 
form. 

The important thing to 
remember about filing a 
federal income tax return is 
to file by April 15 and ensure 
that the correct postage is 
affixed to the envelope. 
Thicker returns, IRS. ad- 
vises, usually containing 
over four items {i.e., Form 
1040 and three attachments) 
will require extra postage. 
Returns which arc sent back 
to taxpayers for additional 
postage will not be con- 
sidered timely filed tax 
returns even if they were 
originally mailed on April 15. 




Divorced Parents May Take 
Medical Expense Deduction 



Homeowners Must Inform IRS 
Of Deferred Home Sale Gain 



Divorced or separated 
parents are reminded of 
rules regarding their child's 
medical expenses, the In- 
ternal Revenue Service 
says. 

Divorced, separated or 
married parents who have 
not lived together during the 
last six months of the 
calendar year, and have 
supplied more than half of 
the child's support together, 



can now deduct the expenses 
they incurred for their 
child's medical care. 
Previously, only the parent 
who could claim the child as 
a dependent was entitled to 
claim medical expenses. 

According to the Internal 
Revenue Service, the child 
will be treated as a depen- 
dent of both parents for 
purposes of the medical 
expense deduction. This 



Owe No Income Tax? 
File To Get Refund 



Filing a tax return may be 
a good idea for some tax- 
payers even if they are not 
required to do so, the In- 
ternal Revenue Service said. 
Many low-income workers- 
like students, retirees and 
part-time employees-are 
entitled to receive a full 
refund of the federal income 
tax withheld during the year, 



but they must file a return to 
get it. ' 

Taxpayers should check 
their Forms W-2, Wage and 
Tax Statement, to see if any 
income taxes were withheld. 
If taxes were withheld, and 
no tax is owed, fiing a tax 
return is the only way to 
recover the money. 



deduction creates a tax 
benefit fon the parent who is 
not entitled to the exemption 
for the child, since without 
those medical expenses, the 
five percent medical 
deduction requirement 
might not be satisfied. 

The deduction does not 
apply where half of the 
child's support is treated as 
being received under a 
multiple support agreement. 

Free IRS Publication 504, 

Tax Itiformntitm fur DirUurcnl 

or Srpnniit'il hitiiritlualt, has 

more information on this 
suibject and can be obtained 
by writing or calling the IRS. 

Common Sand 

The most common 
minerals found in sand are 
quartz and feldspar. 



Homeowners selling or 
exchanging a personal 
residence who then postpone 
paying taxes on any gain 
from the sale must report 
the transaction in the year of 
sale, the Internal Revenue 
Service says. 

The sale must be reported 
using the Form 2119, Sale or 
Exchange of Principal 
Residence, available by 
using the handy order blank 
in the tax package. If a 
taxable gain results, 
Schedule D (Form f(H0), 
Capital Gains and Losses, 
must also be used. 

The IRS monitors the 
returns of taxpayers whose 
circumstances suggest a 
sale which should be 
reported, such as a return 
showing a change of address 
and a real estate deduction, 
but without the required 
form attached. 



Generally, the gain from 
the sale of a principal 
residence is not taxed at the 
time of sale if a new 
residence is at least as much 
as the adjusted sale price of 
the old residence. The new 
residence must be occupied 
within 24 months before or 
after the sale of the old 
home. 

The Lax may be postponed, 
according to the IRS, but it is 
not forgotten. Any gain 
realized from the sale must 
be subtraced from the cost 
or basis of the replacement 
residence, thus lowering the 
basis fo the replacement 
residence. In the long run, 
lowering the basis will in- 
crease the amount of gain 
that will result from the 
eventual sale of the 
replacement home. 

For example: A home is 
purchased for $30,000 and 



sold Tor $40,000. The result is 
a gain of $10,000. A 
replacement residence is 
bought within 24 months for 

$50,000. The $10,000. gain 
from the first house must be 
subtracted from the basis of 
the new house ($50,000 minus 
$10,000 equals $40,000). If the 
second house is eventually 
sold for $65,000 and not 
replaced, the owner must 
pay a tax on $25,000 ($65,000 
minus $40,000), the com- 
bined gain from both homes. 
However, if the owner is at 
least 55 years of age when 
the home is sold, he or she 
may be eligible for up to 
$125,000 of the gain. 

The IRS points out that the 
sale must be reported to 
establish a record of the 
current basis upon which 
taxes on the deferred gain 
can be figured.

(earned money should 
sted wisely. An In- 
lal Retirement 
^ement (IRA) is a 
avestment. However, 
should be chosen 
' r and all financial 
of it checked 
ihly. 



The Facts Before Investing In IRA Plan 



IRAs may be bought from 
different sources, inlcuding 
banks, insurance companies 
and mutual funds. Savers 
should compare IRAs from 
these different sources to 
choose the one that is best 
for his or her situation. Some 
things to lok for when 



shopping for an IRA are: 

-Are there fees? 

-How much are the fees? 

-What is the interest rate 
and how is it figured? 

-How much will be in the 
account at retirement age? 

The Internal Revenue 
Service cautions taxpayers , 



[x Benefits, Filing Aid 
je Available To Seniors 



about misleading or in- 
complete disclosure 
statements related to IRAs. 

Check Details. Even 
though the federal tax law on 
IRAs in general requires 
complete and accurate 
disclosure by financial in- 
stitutions, important details 
are sometimes ommitted, 
the IRS notes. 

i 

One good way to deter- 
mine which financial in- 
strument is the best overall 



investment is to examine the 
part of the institution's 
disclosure statement that 
gives a projection of the 
value of the investment at 
the end of each of the first 
five years and also at ages 
60, 65 and 70. Withdrawal 
penalties for money that is 
taken out prematurely are 
also supposed to be reflected 
on these projections, the IRS 
adds. 

Reminder. The IRS notes 
that taxpayers must con- 



tribute to their IRAs by April 
15, 1987, for the contribution 
to apply to the 1986 tax year. 
Extensions to file a federal 
tax return do not extend the 
deadline for contributing to 
the IRA. 

More information on IRAs 
is available in IRS 

Publication 590, Individual 
Rrtirrmeul Arrun^emfHt* 

(IRA*). To obtain it, use the 
order form in the tax 
package or call the IRS.

essential before selling a

age 55 or older to whom this 
benefit applies.

A recent survey shows most campers seek 
good first class facilities when selecting 
stops. Second consideration is the cam- 
pgrounds ease of approach. Is it on the route 
or located near other interest points? 
Cleanliness was another initial con- 
sideration. These are ail important factors 
when arranging trips to satisfy travelers in 
an unfamiliar location.

They are also available at 
Don's Finest Foods, the 
Deerpath Inn, Helander's 
and Smith's Men's Store in 
Lake Forest. Prices range 
from $12 to $17. Students and 
seniors $9. Group rates are 
available on request. 



fold-down camper will be awarded to a 
registered attendee. Show opens weekdays 
at 3 p.m.; Saturday at 10 a.m.; and Sunday 
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $5 for 
adults and $2 for children under 13. 

For those who enjoy the travel switch from 
land to water, springlike weather has 
provided an early boat show-The 18th 
Midwest Boat and Resort Show which docks 
at, you guessed it, O'Hare Expo. The 
gangplank drops Wednesday, Feb. 25. Doors 
open at noon weekdays, and 10 a.m. on the 
weekend. Illinois boaters spent $196 million 
on boats, motors and related equipment last 
year, as their portion of a $14 billion national 
industry. This provides recreational boating 
for some 69 million persons. Financed 
equipment purchases are made easier by 
relaxed interest rates. Also, finance costs 
continue as tax credits, if the boat has living 
quarters and is used as a second home. 

Air travel fares are likely to increase 
modestly as the industry becomes dominated 
by the six giant airlines that have emerged 
from buy-outs. This will be further actuated 
as passenger counts continue to grow and 
flight demands increase. Super special 
discount rates limit travelers to selected 
destinations, days and hours. They must be 
prepaid and are non-refundable. These 
specials may decrease about 25 perent this 
year. It's reassuring that no scheduled U.S. 
commercial plane crashed last year, despite 



increased traffic. 

Air travelers may be surprised to see 
things going to the dogs in international 
airports. Should a green-jacketed beagle 
hound stop at your luggage, sniff and sit 
down, there's a better than 80 perent chance 
you are carrying something which needs 
inspection. These heaven (scent) detector

Legislature Takes Up 
Issue Of Elder " 




Perhaps one of the most 
difficult types of crime to 
understand is that which is 
committed against defen- 
seless, trusting individuals- 
particularly children and 
senior citizens. Even harder 
to comprehend are acts of 
malice or abuse against 
members of one's own 
family. 

For several years now, 
child abuse has been a major 
concern, with hundreds of 
studies and programs aimed 
al the problem. But until 
recently, the crime of elder 
abuse was a little-known 
problem, despite Ihe fact 
that potentially thousands of 
senior citizens suffer abuse 
every year, said State Rep. 
DickKlemm. 

Elder abuse is not just 
physical abuse of older 
persons. It can take many 
different forms, including 
sexual abuse, psychological 
abuse, financial ex- 
ploitation, confinement for 
other than medical reasons, 
deprivation of services or 
medical treatment, and 
passive or self neglect. 

During the 1984 legislative 
session, Illinois lawmakers 
created the Elder Abuse 
Demonstration Program to 
learn more about the 
problem and help determine 
the most appropriate 
method for dealing wilh 
elder abuse and neglect of 
older persons in Illinois. The 
program has been in effect 
since Aug. 1, 1984 and is 
scheduled to continue 
through June 30 of this year. 
During the* upcoming 
legislative session, 
lawmakers will examine 
findings and results from the 
program and work on plans 
for a statewide effort against 
elder abuse. 

The demonstration 
program was set up through 
Area Agencies on Aging in 
four areas of the state; 



Winnebago County.^ 
Kankakee County, the* 
Suburban Cook County 
townships ofEvanston, Niles 
and Maine, and the southern 
Illinois counties of Franklin, 
Williamson, Jackson and 
Perry. 

A primary goal or the 
Elder Abuse Program is to 
determine Ihe relative ef- 
fectiveness of three different 
mode's of intervention that 
could be used with suspected 
victims of abuse. One of the 
modes being used is referred 
to as advocacy intervention. 
Under this mode, a volun- 
tary reporting system is 
applied which emphasizes 
the client's right to accept or 
refuse services. It also 
assumes that the lowest 
level of intervention will be 
used in assisting victims of 
abuse and neglect. 

The second mode being 
tested is known as legal 
intervention, which focuses 
on the legal system as the 
primary mode of services to 
victims. This mode 
promotes the use of 
restraining orders when 
necessary, the filing of 
complaints with the police 
and applicable courts, and 
keeping case information to 
assist in prosecution. . 

And the final mode, 
mandatory reporting, 
requires certain classes of 
individuals, such as 
physicians, dentists, social 



workers, nurses and others, 
to report suspected cases of 
elder abuse. This mode of 
intervention is generally 
seen as the most intrusive 
and most costly to the public. 

It is hoped that in- 
formation from the four 
demonstration programs 
will provide the state with 
much useful information, 
including the number of 
elderly who are abused and 
in need of protective ser- 
vices; sources currently 
available to help abused 
seniors; identification of the 
basic care and emergency 
services required to respond 
to cases of abuse; and 
determination of the most 
effective approach for 
reporting suspected cases. 

Wilh the program set to. 
expire in five months, of- 
ficials are now in the process 
or compiling information 
from the program and 
assessing the results. This 
data should be .extremely 
valuable in the upcoming 
session as legislators at- 
tempt to develop a statewide 
program to address elder 
abuse. 

Problems like elder abuse 
are some of the most dif- 
ficult that we face. But 
through careful study and 
evaluation, it is our hope that 
a program can be created 
that will save our senior 
citizens from the pain and 
grief of abuse, Klemm said. 



Sheriff's Police Have Films Available 

The Lake County Sheriffs Police have^acquired two new 
audio-visual films which are available for snowing, free of 
charge, to schools, civic clubs, churches and parent groups. 
"Crack," the story of a teenage cocaine addict, shows the 
misery caused by this most powerful form of cocaine. "The 
Latchkey Kids" shows how self-care by school-age children 
of working mothers can be safe and successful. For ad- 
ditional information or to schedule a showing of either film, 
contact Sergeant Ralph Connard, Lake County Sheriffs 
Police, at (312)360-6471.

Lions have also tested 
visitors to the Glaucoma 
Unit, (bus) for diabetes and 
hypertension. The two 
conditions, with glaucoma, 
are major causes of blind- 
ness in adults, said 
Newsome, 

Of 28,400 residents 
screened for hypertension 
(high blood pressure), 450 
were referred to their 
physicians as hypertension 
suspects, and 50 were con- 
firmed as suffering from the 
heart disease. 

Of the 33,705 people 
screened for diabetes, 985 
Were sent to their doctors, 
and 79 were discovered to 
have diabetes. 

"Altogether," said 
Newsome, "we have un- 
covered several thousand 
cases of glaucoma, hyperr 
tension, and diabetes, cases 
which might never have 
been diagnosed otherwise." 

In all three diseases, 
victims have little or no 
indication that they may be 
suffering from the disease, 
until it is too late and blind- 
ness a strong possibility, 
said Newsome. 



A screening test is about 
the only way that a person 
with the disease may be 
diagnosed. Newsome in- 
dicated that a person 
diagnosed as a suspect may 
not be considered a victim 
until this is confirmed by the 
patient's physician through 
additional testing and follow- 
up. 

The Glaucoma Van, said 
Newsome, travels thousands 
of miles every year, visiting 
hundreds of Illinois com- 
munities. Screenings are 
sponsored by local Lions 
Clubs, through the coor- 
dination of the Lions of 
Illinois Foundation. The 
foundation schedules all of 
the screenings. 

All Lions' services, in- 
cluding testing, are offered 
free of charge and. are 
funded through Candy Day 
and other Lions fundraising 
activities. 

Newsome noted that Lions 
are zeroing in on their 
500,000 ' person screened 
since the glaucoma unit 
commenced operations in 
1969. . 

"That will be a red-letter 



day in our history, and will that the landmark 500,000 
be observed with all the person screened should 

hoopla and color appropriate occur during the latter part 

for such an occasion," he of 1987. 

said. Newsome estimated Perhaps the next time we

National PTA Celebrates 90th Anniversary 



The Parent Teacher 
Association ^ (PTA) is 
celebrating its's 90th bir- 
thday. On Feb. 17, 1897, the 
first organizational meeting 
was held in Washington, 
D.C. According to historical 
records, 200 persons were 
expected, over 2,000 at- 
tended. 

Founders Alice McClellan 
Birney, first national 
president, and Phoebe 
Apperson Hearst, first vice- 
president, realized the need 
to make the public aware of 
educational, sociological, 
moral, spiritual and health 
issues facing parents and 
teachers in their daily-lives. 
These two were dedicated to 
providing the means to 
address these issues. 

Since its founding, PTAs 
throughout the U.S, and the 
military bases which 
comprise the European 
Congress, have been in- 
volved in efforts to promote 
the physical and emotional 
welfare of a II children and to 
improve public education 
through legislative action 
and pa rent education. 

Three crucial areas have 
formed the framework of the 
PTA and given direction to 
its efforts for children: 
advocacy, service and 
parent education. As the 
needs of children have 
changed, the organization's 
specific objectives have 
become redefined, but these 
three traits have remained 
constant. 

From the beginning the 
importance of informing 
teachers about advances in 
education has been a vital 
part of the PTA. Early 
members advocated the 
establishment of a hational 
health bureau, U.S. 
Children's Bureau, and 
Home Education Division of 
the U.S. Bureau of 
Education; protection of 
employed children and child 
labor laws; kindergarten as 
part of the public shool 
system; and sponsored hot 
lunch progams in many 
schools. 

Every day the PTA works 
for the welfare of children. 
State and national 
legislatures request in- 
formation and testimony on 
matters related to 
education, children and 
family life from PTA of- 
ficers and chairmen. Con- 
temporary concerns include 
drug and alcohol abuse, 
child abuse, latchkey 
children, tv viewing skills, 
parenting, and teen 
pregnancy. 

In recent years with in- 
creasing frequency, the PTA 
state congresses and

Teenager 

A missing 1G year old 
Antioch Twp. girl, Laura J. 
Homanski, was located in 
Albuquerque, N.M. Jan. 31, 
announced Sheriff Kobcrt H. 
Babcox. 

Reports indicate 

Homanski was transported 
to Albuquerque by her 
boyfriend. Michael Lincoln, 
18 years old. the couple was 
staying at the residence of 
Lincoln's mother, when she, 
in turn, notified Romanski's 
mother in Antioch Twp. The 
runaway was subsequently 
placed on a supervised 
airline flight to Milwaukee, 
Homanski is now in the 
custody of her father who 
resides in Racine, Wis. 



councils have been awarded 
grants from numerous 
sources to study various- 
aspects of public education 
such increasing parent 
participation in schools, 
local safety belt and child 
restraint programs, 
discipline problems in 
schools, absenteeism, 
school/community health 
education, food and 
nutrition. 

The PTA's record of ac- 
complishment for the well-, 
being of children and youth 
is impressive. It has helped 
to secure child labor and 
school attendance laws, 
juvenile courts, maternal 
and child health services, 
public school kindergartens. 



school lunches, funds for 
enrichment education 
programs, libraries and 
vocational education. 

At the local level, most 
PTAs are closely involved 
with issues and problems 
affecting primarily their 
own schools and com- 
munities. Through net- 
working they often find that 
what was thought to be a 
problem unique to their 
area, is more widespread. 
By sharing information with 
councils, states and the 
national organization, they 
can often arrive at solutions. 
PTA leaders spend many 
hours working as volunteers 
to help all children, seeing 
the broad aspect of issues 



affecting the welfare of 
children. 

The PTA is proud or its 
past record and looks for- 
ward to the future with a 
strong commitment, 
knowing that children will 



always need friends and 
advocates who will speak out 
and take action on their 
behalf. * As the nation's 
largest child advocacy 
group, the PTA has been 
committed to a continuing 



course of action that will 
bring the system of 
education closer to ex- 
cellence and make the home 
environment a positive. and 
healthy experience for 
children and youth.

Lakeland's Tax SeminarSet For Next Wednesday 



- While the impact of tax 
reform legislation will not be 
felt until next year's returns 
are filled out, taxpayers will 
have to start planning now to 
avoid being caught by 
surprise. 

That is why Lakeland 
Newspapers, in cooperation 
with the Internal Revenue 
Service, will host a seminar 



on federal income taxes on 
Wednesday, Feb. 25, starting 
at 7 p.m. in a seminar room 
at the College of Lake 
County in Grayslake. ^ 

Open to all interested 
parties, IRS. Agent Sallie 
Coding will speak for. about 
an hour and a half before 
opening up. the floor to 
questions from the audience. 



"The changes will affect 
almost everyone," she said." 
"The new law abolishes the 
deduction for a married 
couple when both work. 
Rules for IRAs have 
changed drastically and 
there are many changes in 
itemized deductions." 

While Coding said she 
would not be giving advice 



on tax planning, she said she 
would give information on 
what has changed and how it 
will affect taxpayers. She 
will offer, advice on how to 
fill out the new W-4 Forms. 

Coding has'been a revenue 
agent out of the Schaumburg 
office since 1980. She works 
in auditing of large com- 
panies and is a certified 



public accountant. 

"Even though -I will be 
giving my presentation for 
the first hour and a half, I 
make room in that for in- 
dividual questions when a 
point is not clear. For in- 
dividuals who have 
questions beyond what will 
be discussed in the regular 
session, I will stay after and 



discuss it with them in- 
dividually," she said. 

Lakeland Publisher 
William H. Schroeder noted 
that the public does not often 
have the chance to speak to 
an IRS agent in a give and 
take situation. "This 
seminar will give people that 
opportunity," hesaid. 

Admission is free. 



During the next few weeks, 

you'll receive this notice about 

changes in your phone bill.

iDDOCK LAKE- the third Wilmot-

filmot's favor for this cage season and 
[the Panthers. at 10-2, in the lead of the 
tern division of the Southern Lakes 
ference. 

le Panthers were slated to meet Union 
fe on Tuesday. They are ranked 10th in 
[state and the Falcons are now 6-6 in

'anthers the lead, 20-10, at the end of that 
rter. ~~ 

ie Falcons came back to cut Wilmot's 

down to one by half-time, 32-31. It was 

iven-Steven game all the way to the 



middle of the fourth quarter with the score at 
that time, 56-56. 

After a controversial foul call against 
Panther Kevin Heckel for "under cutting" 
the Falcons went ahead with two successful 
free throws by Mike Yates. 

Then Brown, who was the games top 
scorer with 19 points, tossed a good one from 
the free throw line. A turn-about repeat of the 
first controversial undercutting, call came 
with both Heckel and Yates involved again. 
This time the call went HeckePs way and he 
made^one of his two free throws tieing the 
score, 60-60, at the two-minute mark. 

. A Falcon foul gave Kolano two chances a I 
the free throw line and he sank both giving 
the Panthers a 62-60 lead. Jim Bruton 
marked up three more making it 65-60 in 
Wilmot's favor and then Falcons Yates, and 
' Greg Sheen accounted for three point to close 
the scoring gap to two points where it stayed 
despite Central's valiant last ditch efforts.

NShe also broke her all- 
around record of 8.2 which 
she had set at Franklin, with 
an 8.33 score. 

In the meet only two girls 
from Whitewater and Kail 
Itiver managed to plat, _• in 
the top three, as Central had 
total control. Whitewater 
had to scratch their top 
gymnast, Tina " Corby, in 
three of the events due to a 
leg injury. 

"At the beginning or the 
year I knew we were going to 



have a decent team. I 
figured we could win the 
Eastern Divistion title for 
the fourth time. I did not 
expect to go unbeaten all 
year. The remarkable thing 
so far about this year's team 
is that with all the records 
they have established, the 
team ^ is not made up of 
superstars. They have done 
it without the services of the 
team's most talented 
gymnast, who decided not to 
come out this year, and they 
still arc getting better and 
better each week," said 
Coach Bill Price. 

The junior varisty team 
defeated Whitewater 98.6 to 
86.7. The JVs finished at 9-0 
and have won 35 meets in a 
row, not losing in four years.'

Nature Cleaners 

Urban pollution fighters 
are taking to the trees in 
their battle against dirty air, 
according to ISaiimml wwdtifv 
magazine. Recent research 
has demonstrated that some 
trees absorb huge amounts 
of pollutants. Red maple and 
white birch, for example, 
seem almost to thrive on 
sulfur dioxide, while white 
oaks are especially good at 
absorbing ozone.

"The need for a new 
trophy case at Central High 
School had been apparent for 
a long time," commented 
Carol Johnson, president of 
the -Falcon Athletic Booster 
Club, "and we decided that 
something should be done 
about it." 

That was last year. Now, 
thanks to the cooperation of 
many, Central High has a 
new showcase which will 
hold hundreds of trophies. 

The trophey case, which 
cost over $4,000. to produce, 
$1,000 of which is in glass 
alone, stretches 24 feet long. 
The money for it was 
donated not only by Booster 
Club, but also by C-Club, Pep 
Club, and the school board. 
Many fund-raising projects 
were needed to reach this 
goal. 

Mr. Nunemaker, Central's 
woodshop teacher, con- 
structed the case. It required 
over 200 hours to complete, 
with most of the work done in 
the evenings or on weekends. 

Nunemaker calls the case 
"the largest project I have 
ever done and one I'm very 
proud of." He adds that "It 
was a good experience to 
have several school 
organizations working 



together toward a common 
goal." 

Johnson, who says that 
Booster Club has received 
many compliments on the 
trophy case, wishes to" thank 
all who helped make the 
project so successful. "I look 
forward to seeing it filled 
and needing another one," 
she says. 

The motto of the Booster 
Club is "Spirit and Unity 
Through Athletics." The new 
showcase is a sample of 
what can be done when a 
need is recognized and 
people work together. 

Johnson reminds the 
community that parents, 
friends, and alumni are 
welcome to join Booster 
Club. Those interested 
should call the school, 
(414)843-2321 for more in- 
formation. 

Completes 

Army National Guard 
Private Christopher A. Frit- 
zler, son of Anita E. and 
William T. Fritzler of Lin- 
denhurst, has completed one 
station unit training (OSUT) 
at the U.S. Army Infantry 
School, Fort Benning, Ga. 
He is a 1986 graduate of An- 
tioch Community High 
School.

Governor Al Smith of New York once greeted an audience at 
Sing Sing Prison with "My fellow citizens..." but then 
remembered convicts were not citizens and changed it to 
"My fellow convicts." When that did not prove accurate 
either, he gulped and said, "Well, anyhow, I'm glad to see so 
many of you here."

An Open Letter to the Supporters of 

LIBERTY LAKES, ILLINOIS 



AMERICA 

C 



We, the Committee to Incorporate LIBERTY LAKES thank you for your continuing support of 
the effort to form a new village. We want to bring you up to date on the status of the incor- 
poration and to explain our position. We have every reason to believe we shall prevail in 
our battle to win the right to vote on our own destiny. 

As you may know, we withdrew from the Lake County Board proceedings when it became 
apparent that we would not qet a fair hearing. We went straight to Court with our Petition 
to Incorporate, and argued that the law requiring us to go to the County Board was un- 
constitutional. The case was bounced back and forth like a political "hot potato". We went 
before four different judges and were shuffled between five different court rooms: 
Associate Judge Harry D. Hartel, who finally heard the case, ruled that the law giving the 
'County Board power over incorporation was valid and he dismissed our Petition because 
the County Board had not yet rendered a decision. We immediately appealed Judge 
Hartel's ruling, and the case is now in the Appellate Court. There also is a chance that the 
Illinois Supreme Court may take the case before the Appellate Court rules. 

Our position is a simple one. The law requiring us to go to the County Board gives the 
board the power to make two determinations; 

(1) Whether bur proposed village is compatible with the county's land use plan, and 

(2) Whether there is a sufficient tax base in order to insure the provision of all 
necessary municipal services. 

We believe that this power to make determinations is quasi-judicial as opposed to 
legislative. A quasi-judicial proceeding has the power to make rulings or findings on a case 
by case basis for each new village, just as a court makes rulings in cases brought before it. 
This is different from the legislative power to pass general laws, even those concerning the 
requirements for all new incorporations that may occur now or in the future. Before we 
withdrew from the County Board, the Chairman of its Planning and Zoning Committee had 
stated for the record that the Board's power was quasi-judicial ! 

If we are right, about the kind of power the County Board has, and we know we are, then 
the law that we are challenging is clearly unconstitutional. There are certain requirements 
for a law that gives quasi-judicial power, and none of the requirments are met by this law. 
For example, the law must provide an opportunity to appeal to an actual court if an unfair 
or unreasonable decision- is made by the County Board. This is a matter of fundamental 
fairness. Yet the law we are challenging does not permit any appeal whatsoever, and 
gives the County Board a kind of absolute power that has no place in this nation's system of 
checks and balances. 

Also, a law that gives quasi-judicial power must set forth clear legal standards so that in- 
consistent decisions will not be'made. In our case, what is the meaning of "a sufficient tax 
base as will insure the ability of the village to provide all necessary municipal services"? 
The County's Planning and Zoning Committee had to request an opinion from the State's 
Attorney's Office on this subject. And the opinion given was that there were no laws or 
cases defining "necessary municipal services". 

In a case very similar to ours, the Illinois Supreme Court struck down a law which permit- 
ted a County Superintendent to determine whether there was sufficient assessed valuation 
to form a satisfactory high school district. The Supreme Court called the law "clearly un- 
constitutional". The reason for striking down the law was obvious to the Court, The 
language of the law Was vague and subject to different interpretations, one superinten- 
dent would decide one way, and another superintendent a different way. Therefore, there 
could be no consistency in the application of the law. The vague language of this law open- 
ed the door for unfairness and discrimination. The law allowed each superintendent to rule 
however he wanted, and that kind of arbitrary power is unconstitutional. Unless the, Illinois 
Supreme Court decides to reverse this case, which is unlikly because it has been the law 
for nearly seventy years, LIBERTY LAKES will easily win its appeal.' 

There is one disturbing factor in our case before the Appellate Court. It appears that an- 
nexations of territory out of a proposed village into an established neighboring village are 
frozen only so long as the petition to incorporate is pending. When Judge Hartel dismissed 
our petition, it was no longer pending, and thus it may be that the territory of LIBERTY 
LAKES is fair game for annexations while our appeal is being decided. What happens if an- 
nexations cut us in half, or take big areas out of our legal description? Obviously, these 
things could have a major impact upon the incorporation, perhaps even jeopardize it. We 
explained this situation to the Appellate Court and asked it to freeze annexation while our 
appeal was being decided. This is something the court has a perfect right to do. In fact this 
kind of a freeze of the status quo is customary whenever there is an appeal so that nothing 
detrimental occurs while the appeal is pending. The Appellate Court, for unstated reasons, 
denied our request I This is the same Appellate Court that did not hesitate to freeze the 
election in the Beach Park incorporation case while that appeal was being decided. 

We then had no choice but to try to get the Illinois Supreme Court to take the case from the 
Appellate Court and to itself freeze annexations. We feel that we had to exhaust every ef- 
fort to protect LIBERTY LAKES. We will not be barred from the fundamental right to vote on 
our own destiny because of an arbitrary and unconstitutional decision by the Lake County 
Board. We will not allow government by the people to vanish in this county, state or na- 
tion. Our rights must be preserved here and now, before they are lost forever. We believe 
in a nation based on law, and we trust that justice will be done. Our battle for LIBERTY 
LAKES may be long and hard fought, but it is a battle for 

OUR LAND OUR FUTURE 
OUR WAY. 

Thank you for your continued interest and support. 

Sincerely, 

The Committee to Incorporate 
LIBERTY LAKES
