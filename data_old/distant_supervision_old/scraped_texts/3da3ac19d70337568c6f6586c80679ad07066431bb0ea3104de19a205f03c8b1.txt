The draw for the 2016 US Open Championship at Oakmont Country Club has thrown up some fascinating pairings, with former winner Rory McIlroy paired alongside Masters Champion Danny Willett for the first two rounds.
McIlroy, who remarkably won his first Major title by eight shots at the 2011 US Open at Congressional, will be targeting a fifth Major Championship, while Willett is of course the last man to have won one of golf’s famous four Majors, at the Masters Tournament in April.
The European pair will be joined by World Number Five Rickie Fowler when they get their respective US Open challenges underway from the first tee at 08:24 local time on Thursday.
Defending Champion Jordan Spieth will play alongside fellow Americans Zach Johnson, who won The Open last year at St Andrews, and US Amateur winner Bryson DeChambeau, in what is a traditional US Open pairing, on Thursday and Friday.
Elsewhere, Europe’s famous Ryder Cup fourballs combination of Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson will be reunited again at 14:09 from the tenth tee, when they tee it up alongside six-time US Open runner-up Phil Mickelson, the man Rose famously pipped to the title at Merion in 2013.
Meanwhile Australian World Number One Jason Day, who has finished second and tied second at the year’s second Major Championship, will tee off alongside compatriot Adam Scott and South African Louis Oosthuizen, in a threeball that each have a Major Championship to their name.
It will be an early start for three former World Numbers Ones when 2014 US Open winner Martin Kaymer, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald get started from the tenth tee at 08:13.
Starting at the same time as that all-European trio, but from the first tee, are three former US Amateur Champions, in the shape of Matt Fitzpatrick, who also won on his last start at the Nordea Masters in Sweden, Danny Lee of New Zealand and Korean Byeong Hun An.
Sergio Garcia, meanwhile, will have American Dustin Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama of Japan for company over the first two days, with that threesome teeing off at 13:36 from the first tee on Thursday, and 07:51 off the 10th tee on Friday.
