The Olympic Stadium in London will host five matches at the 2015 World Cup, with only two club rugby grounds selected among the 13 venues.
The tournament opens on September 18 at Twickenham, which hosts 10 games, including the final.
The only rugby clubs to be afforded the opportunity to host matches are Exeter and Gloucester, although the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff is also being used. By contrast, eight football stadiums will be used.
