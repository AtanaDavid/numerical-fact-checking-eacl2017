The Arizona Department of Housing was established in 2002 to provide housing and community revitalization to benefit the people of Arizona. The agency provides funding to aid in building stronger communities, with most funding geared toward lower income households and neighborhoods. With the exception of mortgage foreclosure avoidance assistance, first-time homebuyer assistance, and the Section 8 Program in Yavapai County – in which the agency offers assistance directly to the public, the majority of the resources of the agency are passed through in the form of loans, grants, tax credits, mortgage or bond financing, and other subsidies, to its Housing Partners, which are local and tribal governments, public housing authorities, for-profit and nonprofit housing developers, and other organizations engaged in providing affordable housing and other community-related services. With this type of mandate comes enormous responsibility in the area of contract and project management, monitoring, and regulation enforcement.
The majority of the agency’s programs are federally funded and the agency receives no State General Fund support. The agency is also home to the Arizona Housing Finance Authority and the Arizona Home Foreclosure Prevention Funding Corporation.
Our Customer Liaison is available Monday through Friday from 8:00 am – 5:00 pm to assist the general public with housing questions.
