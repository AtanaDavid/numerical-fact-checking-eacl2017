90 mins: Stop-start stuff down by the corner flag, Fellaini elbowing Wanyama by mistake. Game bitty and untidy. Rooney in the book for running his yap at the referee.
89 mins: Saido Mane gets the first booking of the night, for cutting Robin van Persie in half.
Commentator starts sentence "Wayne Rooney's had a bit too much to..."
but ends it with "say to referee Kevin Friend" rather than a revelation that United have, as it has looked on several occasions this match, turned up drunk
87 mins: Fletch lives! Mata comes off, Darren Fletcher comes on.
86 mins: Good spell Saints. Mane slips it to Plastic Bertrand as he comes charging through to join in the attack. Sadly, the Southampton left-back cannot work the keeper.
84 mins: Saints have a corner. Can they get something that will save them kicking the proverbial cat this evening? It's pulled back to Patsy Clyne on the edge of the box and the shot's not far wide.
83 mins: Fellaini did okay there, coming out of the defence with that round object and giving it to a guy in similar clothes.
78 mins: It's so Long to the so-so Long as he is subbed off in favour of Emmanuel Mayuka.
76 mins: Good move from Southampton and a hard, low strike from Pelle. Well saved De Gea! Got down looooooooow. Corner's cleared nae bother.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Darren Richman - Fair play to van Persie for scoring twice despite getting the kind of service you'd expect from T-Mobile.&lt;/noframe&gt;
75 mins: So can Southampton rouse themselves? They hvae been the better team by a distance, but it's not about who is better, it's about who scores the most ARSENE
In a true replica of the "Truce Games" at Saint Yves in 1914, this 2014 edition, at St Mary's between the Saints and the Devils, has drawn on the real christmas spirit when the Devils have allowed the Saints to draw level.
GOAL! And what do you know. Rooney lofts the freekick in, the ball sails over everyone and there's RVP at the back post, the keeper's just floundering and Robin manages to volley it home from quite a tight angle. Annoying for me, becuase I was just thinking "I might have a fiver on United at 19/5" when the freekick came in. And really annoying for Southampton manager Koeman - RVP was just left totally unmarked. Idiotic. SOUTHAMPTON 1 MANCHESTER UNITED 2 (Van Persie 71)
70 mins: Tadic off, young Hesketh on.
68 mins: Wanyama fould Mata from behind. I reckon United are going to pinch this.
67 mins: Hard to believe this is 4th v 5th in the table, in terms of the technical quality on offer. Or, you know, maybe not that hard to believe.
64 mins: Rojo fouls Pelle.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Matthew Stanger - This is probably the deepest Fellaini has played under Van Gaal, and it's against a team who like to press high. Not working at all.&lt;/noframe&gt;
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Samuel Luckhurst - Carrick's been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23mufc" target="_blank"&gt;#mufc&lt;/a&gt;'s best passer in recently but he's being wasted in a specifically defensive role due to Van Gaal's selection error.&lt;/noframe&gt;
but on the whole I prefer this explanation.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Rob Smyth - Did United have their Christmas party this afternoon? They all look half cut.&lt;/noframe&gt;
61 mins: Young, United's best player, cuts out a cross at the vital moment. Rojo had again been done.
60 mins: Sensational corner from Rooney! He's blootered that a million miles.
59 mins: Rojo just looks confused. He's given it away again, dwadling on the ball, and Southampton fire a shot over. Tadic set up Pelle, who wasn't far away. There has been a serious lack of quality in this match so far.
57 mins: Saints have a good chance to break but seem to be walking through treacle.. nothing comes of it. A second decent position is wasted a few seconds later with weak passing.
55 mins: Mane, plays it in to Pelle who takes it on the chest and spins well, Shot charged down.
53 mins: Chance! Good cross, Long has time to plant a header... straight at De Gea. Man, he was so unmarked it's not true. He was like a bundle of tenners given to a manager in a REDACTED level unmarked.
50 mins: Fellaini breaks up play well, and has a chance to slip it forward to team-mates... a decent position for United comes to nothing due to a loose pass. Mata throws his hands up in the air in frustration.
48 mins: Well whatever van Gaal said to United at half time, it certainly hasn't worked. More of the sloppy same.
46 mins: Tadic, neat ball to play in Yoshida, who wriggles through the box and should have had a corner when Evans muscled him, and the ball, into touch.
21.03 Off we go for the second half. Rojo picks up where United left off by slicing the ball embarrassingly out for a throw.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: SeÃ¡n O'Sullivan - Retweet if you never stopped hating Fellaini, fav if you're a scumbag who thought "poor start but he's come good, fair play to him"&lt;/noframe&gt;
HT: SOUTHAMPTON 1 MANCHESTER UNITED 1 Poor half, Saints should have scored more than one. United's defence again shaky. An email from friend o'the blog Marc Melander:
Isn't Herrera the player whom United's commercial wizard Ed Woodward sent three random Spanish 'sports lawyers' to try and purchase from Bilbao whilst the veneta de transference ('transfer window' to you) swung shut ?
I have an image of said Spanishers riding, dusty and parched, in the stylee of Clint Westwood in a paella Western, saddlebags laden with coin and Boddingtons. Mounted on asses which is what they seemed to have been sold.
45+ mins: As if by magic, United suddenly produce a marvellous bit of interplay that sees RVP slam the ball into the side netting. Perhaps he was trying to take manager's mind off things and avoid a half-time hairdyer. United, with the possible exception of RV, richly deserve it.
45 mins: Pelle, who looks like his confidence is returning, winds up for a piledriver. totally mis-hits it and it nearly becomes a wonderful through ball for long.
44 mins: Tadic starts a break with a nice bit of skill, but plucky litte United cling on. Six attempts for Saintds, one for Man U.
43 mins: Good defensive work from Valencia as Mane attacks a high ball from Clyne. Goal kick.
42 mins: Evans allowed to run at Southampton, out wide to Young and oh dear God a terrible cross. Southampton will never get a better chance to beat Manchester United.
39 mins: Mane working the United defence, and who's this with a clever little pass that allows Southampton to open up the Man U back line? Yes, it's Herera! That was a TERRIBLE piece of football. What the hell is up with Man U?
38 mins: Paddy McNair is coming off for Ander Herrera. I think that is a tactical rather than fitness choice.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Paul Hayward - Fellaini continues to veer between dud and redemption man. The pass that led to Southampton's equaliser defies explanation.&lt;/noframe&gt;
35 mins: Rare expedition forward as both Rooney and RVP decide to play left wing... The ball's crossed over for Fellaini, who has had a shocker, to head at the defender.
33 mins: Saints attack again and the United backs are all over the place. Mane batters through and Long has an effort go wide.
GOAL! Well it was coming, and Southampton probably deserve it. Fellaini gives the ball away, Davis with an excellent run. Ball's crossed in for Tadic who has a shot blocked but the rebound has dropped for Pelle, who forces a shot home. Deflection in there as well. Anyway, not exactly a thing of beauty but the home side were knocking on the door. SOUTHAMPTON 1 MANCHESTER UNITED 1 (Pelle 31)
27 mins: Tadic finds Pelle, whose shot has De Gea briefly alarmed when it takes a deflection.
26 mins: Southampton wasteful again, Tadic totally overhitting the pass when the nervy United backline gaping.
24 mins: United lose it in their own half a couple of times... The second occasion sees Mane embark on a mazy dribble, wriggles into the area but gets caught under his own feet.
21 mins: Wanyama and Valenica in a good scrap for the ball. Rooney putting himself about and making Fonte ask himself if he has got another mistake in there.
19 mins: Something very Young-ish about this. He battles hard to win a tackle (okay not really that bit) and then goes on a thrilling run from his own goalline. Slips it to RVP, who makes a delightful flicked return pass, and then Young loses it. Such a nearly player.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Rob Smyth - It's great that the English media have finally discovered Michael Carrick, aged 33&lt;/noframe&gt;
Hey, I was 38 before I discovered the Negroni. It happens.
16 mins: Smalling is coming off... Evans is on. Smalling just went up for a simple header, landed fine, didn't look to be anything at ll but he has limped from the field.
14 mins: Saints look to hit back through Mane, who is dealt with by the wily Carrick. Strong move from the Southampton boys, It leads to a corner and Pelle nails it with a free header.... wide.
GOAL! "A classic schoolboy error" says our own Alan Smith, and he's spot on. Rooney makes a break forward and it looks absolutely regulation for the Southampton defender Fonte to tidy up... but he plays a pass back to the keeper without looking up, and it just hands RVP a chance on a silver salver with parsley around it. He sticks it away and that is just such a soft goal.SOUTHAMPTON 0 MANCHESTER UNITED 1 (RVP 12)
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Michael Cox - Southampton often leaving wingers high up v Utd's three centre-backs, rather than tracking wing-backs, should be some Soton breaks&lt;/noframe&gt;
9 mins: Bertrand putting in a sihft, but it's down the right with Long on Young that Saints are enjoying a moment. The cross though, wastes a promising posish.
8 mins: Some excellent pressing by the hosts, looking to get Mane down the left when they win the ball, but United look pretty solid at the moment
6 mins: Gosh, not a lot to write home about so far. Wanyama and Mane, busy in the centre, try to get a move playing.
3 mins: Bertrand with a cross in, headed over by Long, who is the subject of an important stat update.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Duncan Alexander - Shane Long is three inches smaller than Craig Short.&lt;/noframe&gt;
2 mins: Long looking to have a go at Young.
1 mins: United kick off. Fellaini soon loses it to Wana

19.59 Mr Roy Hodgson is in the stands.
19.55 What better time to restart the publishing system, I say?
19.54 United are in blue with a pink stripe down the side. They don’t want any repeats of the grey shirt incident. United have won four in arrow.
19.51 Who do you fancy?
19.50 Just ten minutes until kick off
19.45 United doing their whole back three thing has been one of my highlights of the season so far. Students of comedy have never had it so good.
Gary Neville's disembodied hand. Can a hand be disembodied? BET NOW!
19.43 Anyhow, back to the matter at hand.
19.37 Not relevant to this match but simply brilliant sports TV at the moment as Jamie Carragher digs out Per Mertesacker. "He is the captain and he has abandoned ship... it was men against schoolboys when they played Stoke...as a senior player you have to show the others how it is done.
G Nev joins in: "Arsenal's players are playing like they have no respect for each other. Not helping out your team-mates on the pitch is unforgivable."
Oh, and just time for Carragher to stick it to the "classless" Arsenal fans vis a vis Wenger station booing.
19.35 It's true, they have hardly made mention of the Cup. One of Accrington and Yeovil will get Manchester United.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: John Brewin - Has Monday Night Football pretended the FA Cup doesn't exist? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23mnf" target="_blank"&gt;#mnf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
19.30 "I am surprised that they (Man U) have three centre backs. They haven't done that in the last two games. Arsenal showed in 30 minutes how you have to play against that system." - Koeman.
19.12 While we wait for kick-off, why not enjoy our live coverage of the FA Cup draw?
19.10 Van Gaal with a cagey interview, refusing really to be drawn on specific players "they are all vital." All the signs point to those 11 vital players lining up in a 3-5-2.
Actually, this isn't cagey. This is just rude.
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Samuel Luckhurst - Van Gaal asked why he has named three centre-backs by Sky Sports' reporter.'I don't know. That is what you have said to me.' &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23mufc" target="_blank"&gt;#mufc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;
19.09 And here are the visitors.
19.07 Here are Southampton.
19.00 And here they come...
&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Manchester United - United XI: De Gea, McNair, Smalling, Rojo, Valencia, Carrick, Fellaini, Young, Mata, Rooney, van Persie &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23mufclive" target="_blank"&gt;#mufclive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://t.co/Eg47561mjH" target="_blank"&gt;http://t.co/Eg47561mjH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt;

18.59 Eagerly awaiting the team news, so I am.
18.52 Talking of the sidelines. Rad Falcao's wife says her hubby is fit to play. Here's some pics of the family Falcao from the Instagram page of Mrs Falcao, Lorelei Taron. I am strongly in favour of his micro rucksack thing in the main pic.
Van Gaal says that the player is not ready, but Mrs F says of her husband: "100% ready to give everything!!!"
18.51 Man, what we wouldn't give for a really good Dutch manager punch-up on the sidelines.
18.45 Evening all. Tyers here. Welcome to our coverage of DUTCH GRUDGE MATCH 3000. Without further ado, I bring you my favourite story of the day.
Have you read the super yarn about Van Gaal and Koeman's feud over a holiday home? Hit it, Jon Liew.
For 15 years, Ronald Koeman had dreamed of building his own holiday house in the Algarve. He knew exactly where he wanted to build it, too: a resort called Vale do Lobo, where the beaches stretch as far as the eye can see and where he was already a member of the local golf club. “Like paradise,” is how he described the place.
Construction was finally completed in February 2006. Koeman and his wife Bartina could finally move in. Then, a few months later, there was a terrific commotion just up the street. Mechanical diggers and men in hard hats began to descend on the area.
Somebody was also building their dream home in Vale do Lobo. And that someone was Louis van Gaal. On the face of things, this was a fairly surprising development. Just a few years earlier, the pair had monumentally fallen out at Ajax, where Koeman had helped to oust his former manager.
“I had my fill of him a long time ago,” an exasperated Koeman said of Van Gaal.
“I will never have dinner with Ronald Koeman again,” a betrayed Van Gaal said of Koeman.
Alan Tyers will be along later this afternoon to provide the build-up, team news and commentary for tonight's Premier League clash. In the meantime read some preview material and keep checking in for updates as the day progresses.
"Given that Manchester United have won only half of their Premier League matches this season, have endured a horrific injury list, playing some inconsistent football at times and are dauntingly adrift of top‑of‑the‑table Chelsea there is nevertheless a “genuine feeling” at the club that they are on the “verge of something really significant”, writes Jason Burt.
Four consecutive league victories have helped but senior sources have given a ringing endorsement of the effect Louis van Gaal has had throughout the club as United head to the south coast..." Continue reading...
Jack Cork faces at least six weeks on the sidelines as Southampton's injury problems mount ahead of Monday's Premier League clash with Manchester United.
Saints manager Ronald Koeman revealed the midfielder sustained ankle ligament damage in Wednesday's defeat at Arsenal, when Toby Alderweireld was forced off with a hamstring complaint which makes him a doubt.
Morgan Schneiderlin is unavailable, as are long-term absentees Jay Rodriguez (knee), James Ward-Prowse (foot) and Sam Gallagher (knee), but Dusan Tadic has overcome a knock.
Wayne Rooney will be fit to face Southampton on Monday, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has confirmed.
Captain Rooney had a scan on Thursday to examine a possible knee problem but has been given the all-clear. However record signing Angel di Maria will not be ready to return from his hamstring injury in time for the trip to the south coast.
Luke Shaw (ankle), Jonny Evans (ankle), Rafael (groin), Daley Blind (knee) and Phil Jones (calf) are all expected to miss out.
Forster, K Davis, Cropper, Clyne, Alderweireld, Fonte, Yoshida, Gardos, Bertrand, Targett, Wanyama, Reed, Hesketh, S Davis, Isgrove, Mane, Tadic, Long, Mayuka, Pelle.
