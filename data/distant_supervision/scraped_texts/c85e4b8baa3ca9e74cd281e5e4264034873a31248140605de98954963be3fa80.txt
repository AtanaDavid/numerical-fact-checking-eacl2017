A financial intermediary is a financial institution such as bank, building society, insurance company, investment bank or pension fund.
A financial intermediary offers a service to help an individual/ firm to save or borrow money. A financial intermediary helps to facilitate the different needs of lenders and borrowers.
For example, if you need to borrow £1,000 – you could try to find an individual who wants to lend £1,000. But, this would be very time consuming and you would find it difficult to know how reliable the lender was.
Therefore, rather than look for individuals to borrow a sum, it is more efficient to go to a bank (a financial intermediary) to borrow money. The bank raises funds from people looking to deposit money, and so can afford to lend out to those individuals who need it.
If you have a risky investment. You might wish to insure, against the risk of default. Rather than trying to find a particular individual to insure you, it is easier to go to an insurance company who can offer insurance and help spread the risk of default.
A financial adviser doesn’t directly lend or borrow for you. They can offer specialist advice on your behalf. It saves you understanding all the intricacies of the financial markets and spending time looking for best investment.
Credit unions are informal types of banks which provide facilities for lending and depositing within a particular community.
These are mutual investment schemes. These pool the small savings of individual investors and enable a bigger investment fund. Therefore, small investors can benefit from being part of a larger investment trust. This enables small investors to benefit from smaller commission rates available to big purchases.
