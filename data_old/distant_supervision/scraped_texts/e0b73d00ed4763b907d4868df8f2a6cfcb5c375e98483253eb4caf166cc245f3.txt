The aim of the Toolbox is to provide inspiration and guidance on what can be done to address the pressing issue, based on scientific evidence and experiences gathered from those working in the field across the globe. The Toolbox is built on what has been done in the past in a variety of settingsÂ and is aligned with ongoing and current initiatives. Throughout the Toolbox, a narrative text guides the user on how to work with the problem, combining practical advice with examples from the field, and providing links to external resources. Many resources can be adapted and implemented in a variety of contexts.
Welcome to the Toolbox, and good luck in your work to stop the spread of antibiotic resistance!
