I was talking to a bloke today in work we were talking about betting and gambling he asked me did I ever here of a player called Gabriel agbonglor (sorry for spelling ) he was saying his ex girlfriend used to work in paddy powers and gabby used to put in Â£10000 on a daily basis playing poker online he wouldn't have known I support villa nor does he have any interest in football this was back in 2010 they must have some amount of money to blow.

Everything sadly is relative. 
If your earning 50k a week. is that a lot of money? 
(I'm not saying this is right! )
But let's be honest. if you earn enough money, that you can have anything you want. can we blame them for spending, even blowing some?
Not a professional footballer fault what someone is prepared to pay them!

I seen gabby in star city casino last year so could be true.
{Ed007's Note - The guy's girlfriend must have been right high up (or up to no good) to know who owned online accounts.}

Yea mate sounds like BS, they don't give that sort of information out willy nilly, especially for a high profile customer spending those sorts of figures. When you sign up to those websites and agree to the terms and conditions within the privacy detail there are parts that protect you and your identity as a customer, and even if she were to be high enough to get that info (doubtful), telling someone whose then just letting people who he doesn't know that well know, it doesn't bode well for her job or their relationship lol. Unfortunately because of all that it has to be fake.
{Ed007's Note - I'd take it with a pinch of salt.}

Great point ed!
{Ed007's Note - I do have my moments :-D But it is a rumour site and Mick's posted in a rumour. And be honest, if you seen a player's bank statement would you be surprised to see that kind of cash being deposited in gambling accounts even though it's against the rules for them to bet in matches?}

No! And that's what I was trying to say. it's an obscene amount of money to you and I, but to a guy who earns a week more than the average joe does a year, it's pocket money. Like I said, everything is relative,
I don't blame him having fun with his money if he can afford to, and I don't blame anyone earning it. If you don't like what they earn, blame the people willing to pay it!

Ed he said in his post he was always betting on poker, so he wouldn't have broken any rules, but still BS I think, wouldn't surprise me if he was spending that much on gambling and similar things. I just don't think it would be found outthe way it was described. Plus paddy power is a joke, their servers rarely let you on at peak times lol, if he had any sense he'd be on William hill vegas, then again it is Gabby so sense doesn't come into the question.
{Ed007's Note - Is it seperate accounts for poker and football bets, I thought it would just be one account to gamble on anything on their site? That was my point, I was just meaning in general with footballers, considering the money they make would anyone be surprised to see that kind of money going into gambling accounts whether it's for poker, horse racing or even their sneaky football bets?}

If this is true it just shows gabby is a horrendous poker player.
