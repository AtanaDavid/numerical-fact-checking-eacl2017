On January 6, 2016, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) published a Guidance Update (the “Guidance”) concerning payments made by mutual funds to financial intermediaries that provide shareholder and recordkeeping services for investors in such funds. The Guidance is a product of a three-year sweep exam conducted by the SEC that studied these payments, which are typically classified as sub-transfer agent, administrative, sub-accounting and other shareholder servicing fees (collectively, “sub-accounting fees”).
The use by broker-dealers and other intermediaries of omnibus accounts to hold shares of a mutual fund that are owned by a large number of beneficial owners has increased significantly in recent years.
These omnibus accounts reduce the record-keeping burden imposed on the mutual fund’s transfer agent because the financial intermediary performs many of the typical transfer agent services for the beneficial owners who hold their shares through the omnibus accounts. Mutual funds compensate these intermediaries for the services they render through sub-transfer agency or sub-accounting agreements.
A number of offices and divisions at the SEC have raised questions as to whether a portion of payments in respect of sub-accounting fees may have actually been used to pay for activities that are primarily intended to result in the sale of mutual fund shares and to pay for other distribution activities by the mutual fund.
Under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act (the “1940 Act”), fees paid by a mutual fund for distribution activities must only be paid pursuant to Rule 12b-1, which requires that such fees be paid pursuant to a plan (a “Rule 12b-1 plan”) that has been approved by the fund. Payments of sub-accounting fees that could be re-characterized as fees for distribution activities that are paid outside of a Rule 12b-1 plan would be improper under the 1940 Act.
Given the concerns noted above, the staff of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management (the “Staff”) made the following key recommendations in the Guidance:
The Guidance identifies certain activities and arrangements that were observed during the recent sweep examinations that may raise concerns that a payment, though ostensibly not for distribution-related activities, may in fact be (or at least in part) a payment for such services:
Given the Guidance and the continued growth in the use of omnibus accounts held by financial intermediaries, mutual fund boards should revisit, and if necessary, update their processes for evaluating the payment of sub-accounting fees, especially fees paid to intermediaries that provide distribution-related services for such fund.
