The film is a Gainsborough picture of 1928 (and a German co-production) directed by Geza von Bovary, with Carlyle Blackwell and Benita Hume. It is based upon a very successful British play and the bulk of the film clearly betrays this origin; there are about three interior locations, and both performers and camera are stock still most of the time. The actors are very wooden by Hollywood standards. The characters are one-dimensional (to put it charitably).
However, "The Wrecker" is well worth watching because this is a railway melodrama and the film opens the stage play way up with lots of very, very impressive location photography of steam trains in motion and, count 'em, three spectacular wrecks done full scale, actual trains, no miniatures. The railway atmosphere (including views of Waterloo Station) is wonderful and the wrecks are jaw-dropping.
"The Wrecker" may not hit the mark of a quality major American film, mostly due to flat directing; but there's no doubt that Gainsborough spent real money and effort by British standards of the time.
The film was released in silent and in synchronized versions with brief talking sequences. The silent version was used here. One of the sound sequences was quite effectively faked.
It appears to me that the film was mastered from a 16mm print made in later years from the somewhat worn camera negative. The tonal range is excellent and there are very few visible splices or jump cuts. Only a slight softness of the image suggests that this does not come from 35mm.
