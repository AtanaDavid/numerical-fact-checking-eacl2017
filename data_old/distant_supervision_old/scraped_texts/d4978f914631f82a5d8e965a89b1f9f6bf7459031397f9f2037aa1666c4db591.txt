Tom Watson and Stewart Cink were tonight involved in a play-off for the Open Championship at Turnberry.
Watson needed to par the last to become the oldest major champion in history and claim an amazing sixth Open title – 34 years after his first – but missed from eight feet.
That left the 59-year-old American tied with compatriot Cink on two under par, one ahead of English pair Lee Westwood and Chris Wood, Westwood also dropping a shot on the last 10 minutes earlier.
