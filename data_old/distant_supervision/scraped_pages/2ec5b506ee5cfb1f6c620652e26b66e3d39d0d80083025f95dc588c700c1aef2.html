                     visors do not fall off ferries without being
                     noticed. The waves hitting against the bow visor
                     in severe weather is normally just pushed aside
                     by the flare of the visor. If the waves are big
                     and the angle small and there are impacts, they
                     produce noise and deformations that vibrate the
                     structure and are heard and felt - and you slow
                     down. Therefore it is impossible that visors
                     just fall off ferries under any circumstances!
                     However, criminal politicians and corrupt
                     government civil servants can inventt the
                     opposite - that a visor just falls off a ship
                     and, assisted by media, they will create the
                     illusion that it is the Truth ... while it is a
                     silly Lie. It works because in many countries
                     you cannot query the stupidities of the
                     governments. You are threatened into Silence.

         <P><FONT SIZE="+1">On 28 September 2016, it will be 22 years
         since the <B>M/S Estonia</B> sank in the Baltic Sea 1994 and
         the Prime Minister Carl Bildt ordered SCF to show that the
         visor had fallen off and caused the accident. Bildt knew
         that the <B>M/S Estonia</B> transported military contraband
         and that certain parties did not like it. The SCF Director
         General Olof Forssberg was eager to help Bildt and SCF
         shipbuilding technical expert, my old friend, navy commander
         B&ouml;rje Stenstr&ouml;m invented the following
         fantasies:</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1">The visor was wrongly constructed since
         1980, when the ferry was built, it was full hurricane during
         the night of the accident, the ferry was travelling at too
         high speed due to an incompetent commander and huge waves
         struck off the visor <B>01.15</B> hrs without a single
         person aboard noticing it, the visor then pulled open the
         ramp, so that hundreds of tons of water could silently flood
         into the <I>superstructure</I>, when the ferry's bow dipped
         under water every ten seconds, the ferry heeled more than
         30&#176; after a few minutes and turned 180&#176; south and
         east, when the engines stopped, Estonia then capsized but
         <I>floated</I> upside down and drifted eastward at high
         speed, but suddenly sank completely at <B>1.53</B> hrs a
         mile east of where the visor had fallen off at <B>01.15</B>
         hrs, several hundred people managed to get out to the open
         decks during 10 minutes, but only 137 survived, because they
         did not understand that they must swim and crawl up into the
         life rafts thrown into the water, the ferry was fully
         seaworthy on departure despite there were 22 open,
         watertight doors in the hull, which was not allowed, etc,
         etc, </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1">The German shipyard that built the ferry
         for protected coastal Finland/Sweden trade suggested that
         the ferry was perhaps not well maintained after the first
         owner went bankrupt about 1989, people who suggested that
         the ferry might have sank due to leakage below the
         waterline, which should be investigated, were declared to be
         idiots by SCF (media happily transmitted that message) and
         were blamed in the media to be unintelligent, unscientific
         and unreasonable conspiracy theorists, whose sole purpose
         was to topple the government, the visor was found after a
         while almost one mile west of the wreck, it was said, and it
         was salvaged by the Swedish Navy, which however could not
         tell where it took place, after almost three years of
         accident investigation B&ouml;rje Stenstr&ouml;m died
         suddenly of cancer, it was sadly said, and Director General
         Olof Forssberg took the opportunity to announce that he
         forgot to register a letter, what a serious error!, so he
         was unable to complete the fantasy investigations and a new
         female fat DG had to do it, who then published a final
         report in December 1997 that no one was basically happy
         with, for example, the sinking was not explained, i.e. how
         and why the ferry sank after <I>floating</I> upside down,
         etc., etc., which led to numerous parliamentary debates with
         Mona Sahlin until the government decided in 2005 that it,
         i.e. the <I>sinking</I> process, would scientifically be
         clarified by independent but very well-paid experts from
         Sweden, Scotland, Germany and Holland, which was completed
         in 2008, the explanation was that the <B>M/S Estonia</B>
         floated upside down due to the trapped air in the hull but
         the air was compressed, etc., for 30 minutes, which had
         never happened sooner or later, so the ferry sank. The
         experts declared this while licking the Bildt ass. As if it
         were something? No. Most Swedes just do as they are told
         from above. Easiest way!</FONT></P>

         military cargo protected by Swedish police and military
         aboard. The ship was not <I>seaworthy</I> at departure due
         to lack of correct lifesaving equipment and watertight hull
         subdivision. A false cause of incident was invented; a weak
         bow visor that dropped off. The cover-up of the incident is

         sinking of Estonia on September 28, 1994. The Swedish-owned
         passenger ferry, which sank with an estimated 1,000 lives
         lost including 502 Swedes, was being used in an ongoing
         operation to smuggle stolen Soviet military technology -
         with the approval of then prime minister Bildt and the head
         of the Swedish military. Sweden was evidently being used as
         a transit point for the contraband, which was being
         forwarded on to Israel from Arlanda airport - without being
         inspected by Swedish customs on entry or exit from
         Sweden."</I></P>

         Estonia Investigation demanded</B></FONT></A>
         <FONT SIZE="-1">(15 March 2009) </FONT>Swedish MPs Jan Erik
         &Aring;gren (-), Per Bolund (mp), Kent H&auml;rstedt (s) and
         Aleksander Gabelic (s) demand 091002 a new investigation of
         the Estonia sinking 1994!</P>
         
         <P><I>The reasons are results from latest work carried out
         at the request of Vinnova (The Swedish Governmental Agency
         for Innovation Systems) by various research institutions.
         Some persons participating in the studies suggest that past
         investigations of the cause of the accident are not
         sufficient for complete clarity. </I><A HREF="epunkt19.htm"><B><I>The
         Joint Accident Investigation Commission, JAIC, working
         1994-1997 never studied or explained the causes for the
         sudden sinking. </I></B></A></P>
         
         <P><I>The Vinnova research was presented during 2008 at a
         demonstration of model tests at Chalmers University 3 April
         and at a symposium at Stockholm 23 May.</I></P>
         
         <P><I>At the model tests it was clearly shown that the
         vessel capsized and</I><B><I> floated</I></B><I> upside
         down, which, according JAIC, didn&#146;t happen 1994.
         Furthermore it is now shown that three persons in the engine
         room must have evacuated latest 01.06-01.07 hrs and not
         after 01.23 hrs or later as suggested by JAIC. </I></P>
         
         <P><I>The examples just show two circumstances that the JAIC
         investigation is full of important errors. Another serious
         fault is that questionings of survivors were done
         unprofessionally more to confirm one event than to find out
         all circumstances. The JAIC was not independent. It
         consisted of hand picked representatives of Sweden, Estonia
         and Finland.</I></P>
         
         <P><I>Several expert reports, results of divings the days
         after the accident and other information suggest that the
         description of JAIC in its report &#150; that the visor
         dropped off &#150; does not satisfactorily explain the
         speedy sinking of the M/S Estonia 1994. The uncertainty
         about cause and sinking must be removed and a responsible
         party identified.</I></P>
         
         <P>These factors taken together are good reasons to appoint
         one from Sweden, Finland and Estonia independent and
         international investigation about the sinking of the ship,
         the four MPs say.</P>
         
         <P>The suggestion will be dealt with by the Parliament in
         2010.<B> On 3rd March 2010 Swedish Parliament decided to do
         nothing - without discussion or voting! </B></P>

         <P><B>Safety at Sea Ltd</B> suggests that <B>Heiwa Co</B>
         questions the intellectual and professional independence and
         the technical competency of <B>Safety at Sea Ltd</B> and/or
         its staff. It is further suggested that criticism by
         <B>Heiwa Co</B> is not scientific and that the objective is
         to annoy and damage the reputation of <B>Safety at Sea
         Ltd</B> and/or its staff.</P>
         
         <P><A HREF="vassalos.htm"><B>The Safety at Sea Ltd report
         May 2008</B></A> is evidently a review, where the JAIC
         scenario is modified but it is still maintained that &gt;4
         000 tons of water was loaded in the M/V Estonia
         superstructure within a few minutes causing a list of
         &gt;47&#176;, etc. There is nothing there to annoy or damage
         anybodies reputation. Evidently you cannot load &gt;4 000
         tons of water at open seas into a cargo space full of cars
         and trucks, while nobody hears it and when the light in the
         hold is still on!</P>
         
         <P>It is further suggested by<B> Safety at Sea Ltd</B> that
         the condition with 47&#176; list is stable; the ferry is
         floating on the deckhouse for 20-30 minutes! This is also
         wrong! The submerged deckhouse does not provide any
         buoyancy, all side windows are smashed at once and the ferry
         should capsize at once and then float upside down.</P>
         
         <P>It is finally suggested by <B>Safety at Sea Ltd</B> that,
         when the ferry floats upside down after capsize and bouyancy
         is provided by air inside the hull and displaced bouyant
         materials (as seen in model tests and verified by
         calculations), it will slowly sink! Buoyancy is slowly lost
         during 15 minutes! <B>The Safety at Sea Ltd</B> explanations
         for this are also wrong.</P>

         <P>The following links are news items prior to and after

         unanswered questions. It is then also concluded that model
         tests and computer simulations are falsified by <B>SSPA</B>
         (model tests) and <B>Safety at Sea Ltd</B> (computer
         simulations) to achieve the requested results. <B>Heiwa

         <P><B>Heiwa Co</B>:s recommendation to <B>Safety at Sea
         Ltd</B> in order to save its intellectual and professional
         independence and its technical competency is that it
         publicly withdraws its reports and computer simulations of

         serious errors. Let's do that within 15 days!</P>

                  <P>The model heels fast, when water is loaded on
                  the car deck and the <I>deck house</I> (deck 4
                  upwards) is submerged. However, then the model
                  floats on the <I>deck house</I> for a long
                  time!</P>
                  
                  <P>Why there is no inflow of water into the
                  <B><I>deck house</I></B> is a mystery. We see all
                  <I>deck house</I> windows in the side deep under
                  water and waves. And the windows should be
                  broken!</P>
                  
                  <P>The model should very quickly - at heel angle
                  &gt;37&#176; - continue to flood the <I>deck
                  house</I> and heel to 180&#176;, i.e. floating
                  position upside down. A stable heel condition with,
                  e.g. 70-80&#176; heel does not exist in reality! At
                  that time the model rolls 20&#176; around the heel
                  angle. <I>Probably the model has floatability built
                  into the </I><B><I>deck house</I></B><I> that does
                  not exist in reality! Why put on a deck house that
                  does not fulfill any function. What is hidden in
                  the deck house?</I></P>
                  
                  <P>The model then floats at 90&#176; heel and with
                  the complete superstructure - the car deck -
                  flooded (abt 25 minutes into the video).</P>

         But then finally the complete <I>deck house</I> is flooded
         ... and the model heels upside down ... slowly. The floating
         condition shown in the picture below (next section) is not
         shown after 26.58 minutes of the video! Instead underwater
         pictures are shown. The Estonia floats upside down. And then
         the stern sinks. Very strange. <B>How does the air trapped
         in the stern escape?</B></P>
         
         <P><B>Heiwa Co</B> will analyse the SSPA video further, when

         Valanto and Kr&uuml;ger, HSVA and T-U Hamburg-Harburg
         working for Vinnova, the MV&nbsp;Estonia made a 180&#176;
         port turn south/east already at 01.02 hrs (sic) on the
         morning of 28 September 1994!! According to official
         information by the JAIC the turn took place 01.17 hrs ... as
         witnessed by MV Mariella. The 180&#176; turn took place a
         few minutes before the Mayday at 01.22 hrs.</P>
         
         <P>According to the latest German findings MV Estonia had
         50&#176; list at 01.20 hrs and was drifting at that time. It
         will be interesting to see how the scientists invent new
         events to explain the sinking. The German report to explain
         the sinking will be pusblished in May 2008.</P>

         initial inflow was 1108.9 tons/min. Tests at higher speeds
         could not be done as then the model was overfilled with
         water! By simple extrapolation it is clear that the initial
         inflow at 14.5 knots would be &gt;1800 tons/min. As this
         water will trim the vessel on the bow the conclusion is that
         the initial inflow will increase to 2000-2500 tons/min!

         <P>The JAIC suggests (figure 12.16 in the Final report) that
         the initial inflow at 15 knots would have been only 315
         tons/min increasing to 580 tons/min when there was 1000 tons
         of water loaded. It is thus evident that JAIC miscalculated
         the inflow by a factor 6, which invalidates (again) the
         complete JAIC report. But the writers of the SSPA report
         shall still validate the JAIC scenario! As this is
         impossible, the SSPA staff indicates that maybe the vessel
         sank due to leakage below waterline. Media does not
         react.</P>

         </B></FONT>The dead bodies could and should have been
         recovered immediately after the accident. The
         French-Norwegian company Stolt-Comex offered its services at
         very low cost and had equipment and staff in place. The
         offer was refused. The only logical reason seems to have
         been to prevent outsiders from investigating the wreck in
         early October 1994 and to find the true cause of the
         accident. Probably the visor was then first attached to
         wreck itself, then detached underwater around 4-6 October,
         so it fell to the bottom below the wreck, and as the visor
         was not finally removed/salvaged until mid-November, no
         salvage of bodies could take place in early October. Later -
         all proposals for further investigation of the wreck to
         confirm new findings are refused with reference to the dead
         bodies - they shall rest in peace. So the refusal to salvage
         the bodies had two reasons - to prevent an early inspection
         of the wreck and to prevent any later inspections of the
         wreck.</P>

         Accident</B></FONT></P>
         
         <P>Ship owners and ship safety experts have a lot to learn
         from the <B>'Estonia' </B>accident. The deficiencies 1993 in
         design and arrangements were due to the fact that the
         <B>'Estonia'</B> was never designed to sail on the open sea.
         She was designed 1979 for <I>protected coastal trading
         </I>and the SOLAS requirements were never fully used or
         complied with in spite of certification to the contrary.
         Thus she was permitted by the Finnish and Swedish maritime
         administrations 1980 to have too many (open) watertight
         doors - total 22!, restricted number of life rafts under
         davits, no possibility to evacuate all 2000 passengers
         aboard by life saving means under davits, a swimming pool on
         the the double bottom, etc.</P>
         
         <P>Unfortunately, when the trade changed in 1993, the new
         Swedish/Estonian owners never bothered to up-grade the ship.
         The owners and the maritime administrations were one and the
         same. In retrospect it would have cost very little to have
         made the <B>'Estonia' </B>safe and seaworthy as per the
         SOLAS in 1993.</P>
         
         <P>The hull steel work performed in 1994 to install the fin
         stabilizers should have been better supervised and
         documented. Now the stabilizers were installed in a
         compartment that could only be accessed via watertight
         doors! Then the Estonia would never have sunk in 35 minutes
         as she did in 1994.</P>
         
         <P>The visor and bow ramp were defective prior to the
         accident and could not be locked. The ramp was secured by
         ropes and the visor was held in place by its own weight and
         its hydraulics. The JAIC just concluded without any evidence
         that they were in perfect condition and locked at the time
         of accident.</P>

         Resolution A.849(20) and to review the new proven facts and
         then inform other interested countries. Every time the
         Swedish government has refused with the weak argument -
         <I>no new facts have been presented.</I> In April 2001 the
         Swedish government in a press release referring to this web
         page stated that it did not contain any information to the
         effect that the official cause and sequence of accident were
         wrong! It is very sad - the writer of this web page started
         out trying to help and to improve safety at sea. Now he is
         being treated like an idiot by the Swedish and Finnish
         establishments. </B></P>

                  Commission states is 100% undamaged. The hole is
                  certainly the result of an explosion from inside
                  the superstructure as (i) the edges are bent
                  outboard, (ii) material is missing from the centre
                  inside of the hole and (iii) analysis of test
                  pieces of the ruptured edges show that the material
                  has been subject to high temperatures = explosion.

         Explanation?</B></FONT></P>
         
         <P><B>Many persons ask why the authorities presented a 100%
         falsified explanation and report about the accident. The
         simple answer is that the Swedish government didn't want the
         public to know what really happened, so it decided to make
         up a totally false story - the lost visor. </B></P>
         
         <P><B>By parading 'experts' stating that ferries sink due to
         lost visors and by falsifying testimonies from some crew
         members the conspirators managed to create a fairly credible
         story among the ignorant public. </B></P>
         
         <P><B>Evidently, the visor was attached to the wreck, so the
         visor had to be removed by explosives in order to be
         salvaged, etc., etc., which had to be kept secret. </B></P>
         
         <P><B>And the technical explanations were never good enough
         - evidently a ferry does not sink due to a lost visor - the
         ferry would have capsized and floated upside down with water
         in the superstructure. So why was a falsified explanation
         ordered by the Swedish government? To protect the
         incompetents Swedish National Maritime Authority
         (Sj&ouml;fartsverket)? Or a more sinister cause - to
         protect, e.g. military interests using the 'Estonia' ferry
         to carry secret ordinance from the former Soviet Union to
         Sweden? Will we ever know? It is quite easy actually - ask
         the Swedish government to provide the missing information.
         The whole matter is presently handled by the</B> <A HREF="epunkt149.htm"><B>Swedish

         <P>This is not a "conspiracy theory" website. The definition
         of a theory is: <I>"An assumption based on limited
         information or knowledge; a conjecture (guesswork)."</I> No
         theories are presented here, only conclusive evidence and,
         well, some hypothesis. After the MV Estonia sinking 1994,
         the Swedish Government and its lackey the Joint Accident
         Investigation Commission took it upon itself to be the
         official determiners of the Truth, in this case a story
         about a stupid visor. But, it is evidence, and not the
         Government, that determines what the Truth is. The
         Government's official story about MV Estonia is not the
         divine Truth; do not fall into the trap of thinking that any
         counter-evidence against their story is just a mere
         theory.</P>

         You are not being accused of lying about MV Estonia; the
         Government is.</P>
         
         <P>No longer let society, the media, social democrats,
         moderates, or the Government do your thinking for you. You
         will not be charged with a <I>"thought crime"</I> for

         sinking. You are free to believe whatever you want to.</P>

         <P>According to the logic of the Swedish public, a story is
         not real unless it is reported by the mass media. Following
         this logic, the Government couldn't possibly have lied about
         the MV Estonia sinking unless some major newspaper or TV
         news station said so.</P>
         
         <P>Fact: The media has the exact same evidence that this
         website has. Fact: The media has had this evidence for many
         years. Fact: The media has had many years to say that the
         Government lied about the MV Estonia. Thus, the media will
         not suddenly come out tomorrow and say that the Government
         lied about the MV Estonia.</P>
         
         <P>It is not important to know why the Swedish media will
         not report that the Government lied about the MV Estonia.
         All you need to know is that after many years they have not
         done so and therefore will not do so. As for Heiwa Co, it is
         just an organization of people concerned with safety at sea
         who are here to show you the Truth.</P>
         
         <P>So, either all of the evidence on this website means
         nothing and does not warrant any kind of investigation, OR,
         the Swedish media knows the truth about the MV Estonia and
         is withholding it from the public.</P>
         
         <P>This is the MV Estonia fulcrum. You must pick one of the
         two; you have no other choice.</P>

         <P>If the MV Estonia counter-evidence is indeed so kooky and
         crazy, then how come the Swedish media can't just rebut it?
         What, are they so dignified and classy that they are "not
         even going to justify it with a response"? There should be
         no problem with the Estonia counter-evidence being plastered
         all over the TV news.</P>
         
         <P>Skeptics love to attack the messenger and love to attack
         the plausibility of the conspiracy i.e. "The Government
         lying about the MV Estonia is totally implausible and beyond
         absurd.", but never talk about the actual evidence. They
         feel it is not necessary to acknowledge the evidence, when
         in fact the evidence is the only thing they should be
         concerned about.</P>

         <P>Attempting to debunk the MV Estonia counter-evidence is
         one thing, but simply saying, "I don't think that the
         Government is capable of doing such a thing," means
         absolutely nothing and is not evidence. Stick to evaluating
         the evidence, rather than pushing blind allegiance.</P>

         <P>Once you have viewed all of the evidence on this website,
         make your new decision about the MV Estonia sinking
         immediately. Do not be someone who refuses to act alone,
         waiting to see what others will do first. What you need to
         realize is that you are in fact that "other person." And,
         you need not be in accord with "the collective". Think for
         yourself, rather than falling to peer pressure and engaging
         in groupthink. But remember, "thinking for yourself"
         involves the fact that you do not need your beliefs to be
         validated by other people's beliefs.</P>
         
         <P>If the majority is uninformed, then their opinion means
         absolutely nothing. Just because something is widely thought
         to be the Truth does not automatically make it the Truth.
         You should be able to go up to your family and friends, and
         proudly tell them that you know the Truth about MV Estonia
         1994. And don't worry if they call you "crazy," because it
         is not that you are crazy, it is that they are

         <P>Skeptics will use delusional rationalizations to explain

         matter what evidence is presented, because their ultimate
         goal is to hold onto their existing worldview at any cost
         rather than to be open-minded and seek the Truth. It is a

         <P>The MV Estonia counter-evidence is obvious. The fact that
         the Truth finally after 12 years is coming out is
         refreshing.</P>
         
         <P>MV Estonia is not up for debate. It has already been
         proven, far beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Government
         and JAIC lied about the MV Estonia sinking - that was the
         easy part. The hard part is getting the Truth out to the
         Swedish and Estonian public, because to them the thought of
         their Governments lying about the MV Estonia sinking is
         taboo.</P>
         
         <P>It is not as though the MV Estonia counter-evidence is
         weak, it is blind allegiance, herd mentality and ignorance,
         that is stalling the Truth. The evidence is here, but
         because the people have been tricked into believing the
         Joint Accident Investigation Commission 1994-1997 and don't
         want to feel they have been duped for the last 12 years,
         they stop asking questions. For the skeptics, being correct
         is more important than being corrected. Skeptics are not
         "defending the Truth," they are just defending their fragile
         egos. A real defender of the Truth would take all pieces of
         evidence into account; and then, they would evaluate that
         evidence OBJECTIVELY.</P>

         them, on request, with information about their activities.
         The management controls in the agencies must safeguard this
         right.</I></FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Courier New"><I>Government
         organisation in Sweden differs from that in most other
         countries. Sweden's central government administration is
         characterised by very small ministries. Less than 1 per cent
         of the 300 000 central government employees work for the
         ministries. The agencies working within the different fields
         of competence of the ministries have a high degree of
         independence from the ministries. The central government
         agencies are responsible for making their own decisions in
         cases that involve the application of the law and the
         exercise of public authority.</I></FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Courier New"><B><I>It is common for
         an agency employee to have tasks or interests beyond his or
         her job at the agency.</I></B><I> Decentralisation and/or
         delegation of responsibility and powers create greater risks
         of conflicts of interest and similar situations. One such
         situation arises when civil servants, in the course of their
         duties, are improperly affected by their spare-time
         occupations. </I><B><I>This is particularly true for
         universities and technical institutes, where many employees
         have second occupations.</I></B><I> For example, university
         employees may own companies that have business relations
         with their own university. Such situations, which in
         themselves are questionable, can mean that employees, on
         behalf of their university departments, favour their own
         companies in a bidding process. The public's faith in civil
         servants can be shaken by problems of conflict of interest
         if agency management is unable to apply the Administrative
         Act's rules on conflict of interest in the agency's internal
         control system. </I><B><I>Conflicts of interest and
         part-time occupations still pose a serious problem,
         especially in universities.</I></B></FONT></P>
