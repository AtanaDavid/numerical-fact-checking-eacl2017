This lesson encourages pupils to examine and investigate the British reaction to the outbreak of the French Revolution. Through the use of primary source evidence from a contemporary newspaper, together with both official and private correspondence from the time, pupils are asked to decide how seriously the British government took the events of 1789 in 1789.
This lesson can form part of studies for Scheme of Work Unit 10: France 1789-94 – ‘Why was there a revolution?’ It is useful specifically for part four of the unit that requires pupils to decide: ‘Why was the Bastille attacked and destroyed?’, although it can of course be used for any investigation into the French Revolution. Use of this snapshot covers National Curriculum requirements for History in relation to general requirements (2a), together with breadth of study requirements to examine a European study before 1914 (11).
