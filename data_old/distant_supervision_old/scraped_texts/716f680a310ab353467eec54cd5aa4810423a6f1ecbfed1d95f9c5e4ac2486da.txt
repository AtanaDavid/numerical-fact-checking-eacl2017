Yikes, and I thought California’s attendance was bad *before* jumping from the MISL.
Having followed the NPSL incarnation of the Drillers, seeing a whopping 177 show up in Edmonton leaves me at a loss for words.  At that level of paid attendance (which is a generous assumption), current ticket price ($15) and number of home games (6) — the Drillers will gross less than $20,000 in gate revenue for the entire season.  After reading that the CMISL teams operate on budgets “between $200,000 $400,000 a year”, it makes me wonder just how long any of these teams will survive.
Interesting stat about that list — the top 3 averages are from “expansion” teams (although, San Diego is far from a “new” market).  In addition to that the current leader, Prince George, resides in a market of less than 100,000 people (within a 2 hour radius).  Granted, the Fury have only one competitor for sports-dollars — PG’s junior hockey team which sits dead last in the league.
