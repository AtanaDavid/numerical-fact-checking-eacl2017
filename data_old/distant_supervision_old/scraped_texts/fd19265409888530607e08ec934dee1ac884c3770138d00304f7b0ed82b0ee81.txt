Stripped: Miss Althaus, (pictured in red holding hands with winner Jacqueline Zuccherino), has deleted her Twitter account since the video emerged
When Gawker began to inquire into the video, Miss Althaus quickly deleted her Twitter account.
Future Productions, which produces the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA state pageant, removed Miss Althaus' name from the Official Results 2012 page, as well as a video showing the moment when the results are called out during the 2012 pageant.
As of Thursday morning, the entire 2012 results page was removed from the Miss Colorado website.
Last year, Miss Delaware Teen USA 2012, gave up her crown after a porn video produced by the same outfit as the film allegedly portraying Miss Althaus surfaced.
Melissa King was forced to admit that she had recorded the porn video before she won the pageant, after a clip emerged of her stating her name to the camera.
