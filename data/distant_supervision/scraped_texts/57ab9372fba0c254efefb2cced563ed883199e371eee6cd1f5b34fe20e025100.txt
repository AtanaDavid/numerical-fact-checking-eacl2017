(CNSNews.com) – In 2012, there were more black babies killed by  abortion (31,328) in New York City than were born there (24,758), and  the black children killed comprised 42.4% of the total number of  abortions in the Big Apple, according to a report by the New York City  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
The report is entitled, Summary of Vital Statistics 2012 The City of  New York, Pregnancy Outcomes, and was prepared by the New York City  Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Office of Vital Statistics. (See  Pregnancy Outcomes  NYC Health 2012.pdf)
Table 1 of the report presents the total number of live births,  spontaneous terminations (miscarriages), and induced terminations  (abortions) for women in different age brackets between 15 and 49 years  of age. The table also breaks that data down by race – Hispanic, Asian  and Pacific Islander, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black – and also  by borough of residence: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten  Island.
The numbers show that in 2012, there were 31,328 induced terminations  (abortions) among non-Hispanic black women in New York City.  That same  year, there were 24,758 live births for non-Hispanic black women in New  York City.  There were  6,570 more abortions than live births of black  children.
In total, there were 73,815 abortions, which means the 31,328 black babies aborted comprised 42.4% of the total abortions.
For Hispanic women, there were 22,917 abortions in New York City in 2012, which is 31% of the total abortions.
The number of non-Hispanic white abortions was 9,704, and the number of Asian and Pacific Islander abortions was 4,493.
The total number of live births in New York City in 2012 for women  ages 15-49 was 123,231. That is a rate of 14.8 live births per 1,000  women, which is the lowest rate since 1979, according to the report. In  addition, the live birth rate (per 1,000 women) has declined 3.9% since  2003, when it was a 15.4 rate, states the report. (See Pregnancy Outcomes  NYC Health 2012.pdf)
In addition, while there were 73,815 abortions in New York City in  2012, the rate of abortions per 1,000 women is down 8.6% since 2011,  according to the report.
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have  not published their abortion statistics for 2011 or 2012 yet, they do  have data for 2010.  (See Table 12.)   In the CDC’s numbers, there were 38,574 black babies killed by abortion  in New York City in 2010; Hispanic babies aborted, 27,112; white babies  killed by abortion, 9,220; and “other” aborted, 5,368.  The total  abortions in New York City in 2010 “reported by known race/ethnicity”  were 80,274, according to the CDC.
