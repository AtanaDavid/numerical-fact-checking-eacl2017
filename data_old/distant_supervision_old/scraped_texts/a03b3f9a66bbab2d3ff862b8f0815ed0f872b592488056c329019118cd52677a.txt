We're top of the @premierleague. Oh boy! #LeiChe
Oh boy indeed! But many people saw this coming. I predicted a 2-1 win for Leicester at the top of this MBM, and so it proved, Vardy and Mahrez again proving the difference. But whilst those two will grab the headlines, this was a total team effort. Fuchs, Huth, Morgan, Kante, Albrighton were sensational. Ranieri got his tactics spot on to sting his former team. They had just 35% possession.
Mahrez was given man-of-the-match. Perhaps I undersold his goal tonight. He showed some fine trickery to throw Azpilicueta off balance – no easy feat – before bending a beautiful shot past Courtois. “We’re still not safe,” smiles the Algerian in his post-match interview. “We need 42 points.”
“He’s doing things with his left foot that only Messi can do,” says Jamie Carragher.
With Willian having an off night and Hazard going off injured, Chelsea failed to get going until the final quarter of the match. But it proved to be too late, even if Pedro did have one moment of quality on the left.
“I’m quite torn,” sighs Karl Nygren. “On one hand I absolutely lavish in my schadenfreude of watching Chelsea continue their pathetic season form. On the other, I’m getting genuinely worried by the amount of points Leicester are picking up (and more importantly, how well they’re doing so). As a Man United supporter, Leicester is starting to look like a genuine top-4 rival (more so than Chelsea anyhow, who would have thought).”
Thanks for your emails and tweets tonight. What a great game. See you next time. Bye!
