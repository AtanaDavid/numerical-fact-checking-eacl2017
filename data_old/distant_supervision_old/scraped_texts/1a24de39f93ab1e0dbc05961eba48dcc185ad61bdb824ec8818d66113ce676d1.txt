Returning to the site of his G1 Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap victory earlier this year, four-year-old Lochte (Medaglia d'Oro) made it back to the winner's circle in The Vid Stakes on the turf September 13.
Sent off as the 8-5 favorite, the son of Medaglia d'Oro was positioned along the inside in sixth in the one-and-one-sixteenth-mile race. At the top of the stretch Lochte angled to the outside for running room and charged on the outside to take over the lead for the score in the final stages of the race.
Bred by Maura Gittins, Lochte was a $475,000 Saratoga yearling purchase. He is out of the Stakes-winning Lemon Drop Kid mare Lemon Kiss, who is a full-sister to multiple Graded Stakes winner Kiss The Kid.
Lochte represents one of 11 G1 winners for his sire Medaglia d'Oro, whose other G1 winner this year was Coffee Clique, who impressed in the G1 Just A Game Stakes on the turf at Belmont. Other top runners for the sire include Horse Of The Year Rachel Alexandra, G1 CashCall Futurity winner Violence, and Plum Pretty who became the second G1 Kentucky Oaks winner for the sire. Most recently in late August, Medaglia d'Oro colt Atreides showed exciting potential staying unbeaten as a 12-length winner of the Monarchos Stakes at Gulfstream.
