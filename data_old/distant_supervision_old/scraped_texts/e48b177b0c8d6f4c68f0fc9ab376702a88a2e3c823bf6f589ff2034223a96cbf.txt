The Chicago Mustangs were an American professional soccer team based out of Chicago, Illinois that was a charter member of the United Soccer Association in 1967. The league was made up of teams imported whole from foreign leagues.[1] The Chicago club was actually Cagliari Calcio from Italy.[2][3] The franchise was owned by Arthur Allyn Jr., the owner of Artnell Corporation and Major League Baseball's Chicago White Sox. The Mustangs shared Allyn-owned Comiskey Park with the White Sox for its home matches. They drew just 25,237 paid admissions over the course of 6 home games.[2]
Following the 1967 season, the USA merged with the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) to form the North American Soccer League (NASL) with the teams from the former USA having to create their rosters from scratch. Chicago left the NASL after one season.[4] After 1968, the Mustangs became a semi-pro team and eventually became a B-Team/feeder team to the Chicago Sting.
