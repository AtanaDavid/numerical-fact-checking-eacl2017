CalPortland is a major producer of high quality construction aggregates in the western United States and Canada. Aggregates, including sand, gravel and crushed stone, are one of the world’s most basic building materials and are essential to economic growth. You see and use aggregate products every day. When combined with cement, they are a key ingredient in concrete, concrete block, concrete roof tiles and concrete pipe. Aggregates are also a key ingredient of asphalt. They’re used to build homes, school buildings, and the sidewalks, roads, bridges and airports that allow us to get around.
In addition to being able to distribute by truck, some of our sites also have the ability to distribute by barges. Geographically we distribute aggregates in Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and British Columbia.
Regional offices of our Materials Division for aggregates are strategically located in Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Santa Maria, CA; Glendora, CA; Las Vegas, NV; Phoenix, AZ and Tucson AZ.
The key ingredients of ready mixed concrete and many concrete products are sand, gravel, and crushed stone. CalPortland provides aggregates for a broad range of construction from the simplest applications to projects with specialized high performance characteristics. Our expertise in logistical management enables us to distribute high strength aggregates throughout our network when high performance is required. We also specialize in providing full lines of graded stone in various sizes, as well as concrete sand, masonry sand, and gravel.
We are also pioneers in the implementation of recycled aggregate and concrete sand through the development of our “Clean Site” technology that reduces waste and allows us to conserve our precious natural resources.
