A two-hour drive north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv lies the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, site of the worst nuclear accident ever recorded. In the aftermath of a reactor explosion in 1986, cities and villages were abandoned. Decades on, tourists can visit the zone to find an eerie landscape of crumbling buildings being reclaimed by nature. It’s a prime example of dark tourism.
