Right in the middle of Refugee Week 2016, a Sudanese man has been sentenced to nine months in jail after walking through the Channel Tunnel from France to Britain.
Abdul Rahman Haroun, who has been granted asylum in the UK, pleaded guilty to "obstructing an engine or a carriage using a railway".
The 40-year-old Sudanese refugee was caught near the end of the 31-mile tunnel at Folkestone, Kent on 4 August last year.
