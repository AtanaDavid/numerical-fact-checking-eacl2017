NotesJoe Inman Jr. of Marietta, a multi-winner on the Champions Tour, earned medalist honors with a 6-under-par 66 and will make his first U.S. Senior Open appearance since 2003. That year he tied for 40th with a fellow Marietta resident, Larry Nelson.
Gary McCord of Akron, Ohio and Bill Spannuth of Loganville, Ga., tied at 67 for the final two qualifying spots. McCord, a golf analyst for CBS, earned his seventh U.S. Senior Open berth and first since 2003. Spannuth, who won the Georgia Senior Open last month, is also going back to the U.S. Senior Open for the first time since 2003, where he shot 77-78 and missed the cut.
There was a two-man playoff at 68 for the first and second alternate positions between Tim Simpson of Greensboro, Ga. and amateur Don Marsh of Alpharetta, Ga. Simpson, who was inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame this past January, recorded par on the second playoff hole to earn the first spot. Marsh, who was runner-up to Spannuth at the Georgia Senior Open, is an alternate for the U.S. Senior Open for the third straight year.
St. Ives Country Club (6,860 yards, par 72) served as host for one of 42 sectional qualifying sites nationwide taking place from June 9-19.
