A group of intrepid adventurers spent a weekend in the Lake District for the third Wasdale reunion event.
The reunion, which was first held in 2007 and then again in 2012, saw former pupils travel to the Cumbrian valley from all over the UK for three days of walking, viewing the stunning scenery and reminiscing about times gone by.
Many of those attending went to the Wasdale camps whilst at school in the 1980s and 1990s and became camp leaders in sixth form and they were keen to pass on their experiences with some bringing their partners and children. The weekend was organised by Old Stopfordian Ian Hall and former teacher Chis Muscutt.
Undeterred by the rain and low mist the walkers made their way to Sty Head with a hearty few, led by Robin Condliffe, continuing up the Corridor Route to Scafell Pike.
The group then reconvened in the schoolhouse where they read the logbooks, reflected on the past and noted how times have changed! The logbooks are a real testament to the spirit of Wasdale and the sense of adventure and fun.
Chis, former Head of German and more recently Co-Curricular Coordinator at the school, had a great time: “I have attended many reunions but the Wasdale reunions are really special. There is a unique bond across the year groups and it is such a joy to meet up with such great people!”
Robin and Honor Condliffe echoed Chris’s statement with Robin saying: “It was great fun and the shoes have now dried out – I can’t remember being so wet in Wasdale before! Like everyone who attended we would like to offer our heartfelt thanks for such a splendid trip!”
