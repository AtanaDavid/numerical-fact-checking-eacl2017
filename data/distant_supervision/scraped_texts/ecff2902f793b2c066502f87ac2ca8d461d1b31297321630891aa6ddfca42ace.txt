Rates and ratios are two of the most widely used abor­tion measures. They are indispensable statistics for documenting levels of abortion across time and space. The abortion rate is a useful tool in the evaluation of contraceptive services, either for the purpose of setting a baseline or for measuring progress. The abortion rate reflects contraceptive method and user effectiveness, as well as access to services. The rate is less useful than facility-based or other data for the evaluation of demonstration projects or the effects of separate pro­gram components.
Several factors affect the rate: 1) the proportion of women who become pregnant in a year; 2) the likeli­hood a pregnancy is unwanted; and 3) the likelihood an unwanted pregnancy will be terminated. Consequently, increasing effective contraceptive use and thus decreas­ing the number of unwanted pregnancies can lower the abortion rate, while potentially lowering fertility.  On the other hand, if the number of pregnancies is constant but more unwanted pregnancies are carried to term, the abortion rate will also decrease, with the effect of po­tentially increasing fertility.
Like the total fertility rate, the TAR is eas­ily understood and serves as an effective statistic for comparative purposes. The advantage of the TAR is that is takes into account the probability of becoming preg­nant and the probability of terminating each pregnancy throughout the reproductive life cycle. Like the abor­tion rate, a high TAR may indicate several factors, in­cluding the availability and quality (or lack thereof) of contraceptive services. A high TAR may also reflect a high prevalence of traditional contraceptive method use in a given country.
Development of the abortion rate by specific age ranges (such as 15-19 or 24) can also be a useful tool for docu­mentation of those groups at particular risk for abor­tion.
