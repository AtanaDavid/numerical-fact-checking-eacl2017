The Q&A will feature Ledley King, and a coach whose name rhymes with Leffen Reund. Unfortunately space will be first come first serve. We will try to accommodate as many as we can but the bar has limitations.
On Saturday it gets real. The Chicago Fire will be taking on Tottenham. The Fire runs buses from different bars in the city and tickets can be purchased from - Pub to Pitch
The buses with the most spurs supporters will be leaving from the Atlantic Bar. But we will have Spurs bus captains on each bus helping guide all of the yiddos to the Away End parking Lot shindig.
Saturday prior to the game at 5p.m. we will be taking on Section 8 (the Chicago Fire's supporters group) in a friendly game of footy. We will be playing on the Fire's training field which is located in the parking lot at Toyota Park. We will be wearing white, if you have a kit please wear it. If not please bring a white colored shirt. Also it is a turf pitch so please bring turf/indoor shoes. Cleats are not allowed on the pitch.
After the game there will be an after party at the Atlantic Bar.
If you have any questions please feel free to ask them here or on Twitter @chicagospurs or theboard@chicagospurs.org
Also if you have any questions about what to do in Chicago while you are here we have some suggestions for you!
P.S. - there maybe an error when trying to get a bus ticket. We are aware and we have alerted the fire to the issue. Will advise when more information is available.
P.S.S - Tomorrow July 1st at 7pm, we will be having an Open Board meeting at the Atlantic. If you are in the Chicago area you should come by.
