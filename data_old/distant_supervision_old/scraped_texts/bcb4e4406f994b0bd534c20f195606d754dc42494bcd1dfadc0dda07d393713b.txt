There was talk towards the end of last season about how Tottenham were coming for Leicester. Claudio Ranieri’s side waited and they waited, before wrapping up the title in relatively comfortable style. Their 1-0 win in this fixture last January had been a crucial result – on a night when Mauricio Pochettino was as animated as he has been in the White Hart Lane dug-out. Tottenham, who have made their best start to a Premier League season, are after a measure of revenge. David Hytner
