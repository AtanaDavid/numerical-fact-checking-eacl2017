Lou Graham, 37, defeated John Mahaffey, 27, in an 18-hole playoff over the
No 3 Course of the Medinah Country Club, Medinah, Illinois after both men scored
three-over-par 287s in regulation play. Graham shot 71 in the playoff and Mahaffey
shot 73. Bob Murphy, Frank Beard, Ben Crenshaw and Hale Irwin, the 1974 Champion
tied for third with 288. Graham could have won outright with a par 4 on the
72nd hole, but after a perfectly placed tee shot in center fairway he hit his
6-iron approach into a greenside bunker and made 5, dropping him into a tie
with Mahaffey, who had already finished.
In the playoff Graham sent ahead by scoring a birdie on the fourth hole, and
he was never caught. He extended his lead to three strokes after the 10th hole
and still led by two with one hole to play. On the 18th, however, Graham hooked
his tee shot into the left rough creating the possibility of a tie if he lost
a stroke to par and Mahaffey birdied the hole. Graham, however, played a low
4-iron to the edge of the green and saved par, winning by two strokes. Pat Fitzsimons,
with a hole-in-one on the 187-yard second and Tom Watson shared the first day
lead with 67s. Jim Wiechers was a stroke behind in third place, while Arnold
Palmer, Lanny Wadkins, Grier Jones and Peter Oosterhuis, were tied for fourth
at 69.
Eight players were under par and seven others matched it. Graham shot 74 to
stand seven strokes back of the leaders, while Mahaffey had 73. Play of the
second round was interrupted by an electrical storm. When it resumed Tom Watson
shot 68 which, coupled with his opening 67, put him in the lead by three strokes
over Ben Crenshaw, who also scored 68. Watson's total of 135 equaled the 36-hole
record first set by Mike Souchak in 1960 and equaled by Bert Yancey in 1968.
Fitzsimons was third at 140 with 67-73. Jim Wiechers shot 73 and was tied for
fourth at 141 with Terry Dill (72-69) and Lee Trevino (72-69).
Graham, meanwhile, shot 72 and was 11 strokes behind. Mahaffey stood at 144.
Eleven players had sub-par rounds and ten others were at even par for the day.
In the third round, Frank Beard shot 67 and climbed from a tie for tenth place
after 36 holes into a three-stroke lead after 54 with 210. Fitzsimons and Watson
were tied for second 213. Lou Graham shot one of the day's four sub-par rounds
and moved into a tie for fourth t 214 with Peter Oosterhuis and Crenshaw. Mahaffey
was at 216 tied for tenth place. In the final round, Beard shot 78 and fell
into a tie for third place with Bob Murphy, Crenshaw and Irwin.
Beard lost his chance when he bogeyed 17 and 18 and Crenshaw fell back by
scoring 5 on the 17th - a par 3 hole. Jack Nicklaus lost a stroke on each of
the last three holes and finished two strokes behind at 289. Prize money totaled
$235,700; Graham received $40,000 and Mahaffey $20,000. The entry of 4,214 was
the second largest in Open history. Attendance for the Championship proper reached
97,345 setting a new record, while the playoff, on a Monday, was viewed by 6,246.
