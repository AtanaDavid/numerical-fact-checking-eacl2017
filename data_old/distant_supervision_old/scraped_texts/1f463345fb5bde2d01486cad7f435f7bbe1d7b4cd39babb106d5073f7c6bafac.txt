The only information about the tragedy in the Soviet media immediately after the disaster was a short note in a local daily, Vechernyaya Moskva, the next day. It said:
On 21 and 24 October 1982, two Soviet national sports newspapers – the daily Sovetsky Sport[6] and weekly Football-Hockey[10] – published detailed accounts of this match, but did not even mention any spectator accident.
The article in Vechernyaya Moskva did not go unnoticed by the West. It was reproduced by the Italian news agency ANSA.[18] On 22 October, just two days after the tragedy, La Stampa published a front-page article, where it revealed the information from the Soviet newspaper to its readers and speculated whether the word "casualties" should be understood as "injured" or "injured and killed".[18] In this article La Stampa also said that the stampede was probably caused by the fall of a woman,[18] although La Stampa's source of that information is unclear, as this detail was not revealed by Vechernyaya Moskva.[17]
On the next day, 23 October, Italian,[19] Spanish[20] and other Western newspapers stated that there were 3 people killed and 60 injured in this stampede, citing the Dutch journalists who were present at the match.[19] They also mentioned, that, according to the Dutch journalists, both exits at the stand were open.[19][20] According to El País, the information about 3 fatalities and 60 injured was distributed by the Dutch news agency ANP.[20]
Three days later, on 26 October The New York Times wrote that "more than 20 persons were killed and dozens were injured in a panic at Lenin Stadium".[21]
Ten days later, in the article published on 5 November 1982, La Stampa stated that "it seems that 72" people were killed and "at least 150" were injured in the Luzhiniki disaster, citing the unnamed "unofficial sources".[22]
By 1987, El País had lowered its number of estimated fatalities to 68.[23]
Until 1989, none of these figures were either confirmed or challenged by the Soviet officials.
Soviet citizens were able to learn the details of this disaster only from the reports of the Voice of America and other Western shortwave-radio broadcasters.[9]
The first publications in the Soviet Union about the number of fatalities of the Luzhniki tragedy appeared only after the introduction of the Glasnost policy by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the end of the 1980s.[9]
On 18 April 1989, three days after the Hillsborough disaster, and seven years after the Luzhniki tragedy, Sovetsky Sport published a list of the football disasters in history, and mentioned the Luzhniki disaster among them.[24][25] The journalists noticed that no information about the number of fatalities in Luzhniki had ever been revealed in the Soviet media and suggested that there were about 100 fatalities, without providing any reference.[24][26][25]
The information from this article was immediately reproduced by Italian,[24] French,[26] Spanish[25] and other international media outlets.
Three months later, on 8 July 1989, Sovetsky Sport published another article, "Luzhniki's Dark Secret",[27][28] which received even more publicity in the West. A pair of journalists admitted in the article that they were not familiar with the archived evidence from the criminal investigation and therefore they did not know even the number of fatalities.[27] So, they loosely estimated it at 340 fatalities, citing the unnamed "parents of the children who died",[27] but admitting that it is "an unverified figure".[27] The journalists went further, accusing the police officers at the stadium of provoking this disaster and making some other allegations.[27]
Though full of numerous factual mistakes and fabricated details,[1][2][3][12][29] this article immediately became a sensation in the Western media. Reuters,[30] Associated Press,[31] Agence France-Presse,[32] UPI,[33] and other news agencies replicated the news about the "340 fatalities" of the "worst-ever sporting disaster in the history". By the end of next day, The New York Times,[30] Los Angeles Times,[31] The Washington Post,[34] La Stampa,[35] la Repubblica,[36] Le Monde,[33] die Tageszeitung,[32] and other leading newspapers publicized this information all over the world.
Two weeks later, on 20 July 1989, the Soviet newspaper of record Izvestia published an interview with a Detective Aleksandr Shpeyer, who was in charge of the 1982 investigation of the Luzhniki disaster. In this article, named "The Tragedy at Luzhniki: Facts and Fabrication",[1][2] Detective Shpeyer provided various factual details of the disaster and revealed the real number of fatalities (66) and injured (61).[1][2][3] When being asked, why this information was hidden from the public for so many years, Shpeyer replied that Prosecutor's Office did not hide any information.[1][2] The archives are open and any researcher could explore the evidence for themselves, after making an official, but simple request, the detective advised.[1]
Unlike the "dark secret" article of Sovetsky Sport, the article in broadsheet Izvestia was hardly mentioned by the international media.[3]
The next day, Sovetsky Sport in its editorial admitted that its journalists, who wrote the sensational article two weeks earlier, had to use "conjectures" to provide details of this tragedy.[37] At the same time, the editors expressed their satisfaction over the worldwide response evoked by their article.[37]
In a special press conference in Moscow in August 1989, the Moscow Prosecutor's Office confirmed that there had been 66 fatalities in the disaster in Luzhniki.[12]
On 27 September 1989, Sovetsky Sport finally admitted that information provided by their journalists "could not be confirmed"[2] and that "emotions had prevailed over the facts".[2] The author of this article, Vladimir Geskin, stated that "there were no reasons to doubt the results of the investigation",[2] reported by Izvestia on 20 July.[2]
Some controversy in the media coverage of the Luzhniki football disaster is not unique. In 1989, three months before the "dark secret" article in Sovetsky Sport, The Sun newspaper published a sensational article in the UK about the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 people lost their lives. That article also contained strong allegations and cited unnamed sources.[38]
The sensational versions of the Luzhniki disaster proved to be much more popular with the media than the facts provided by the investigation.
Despite its refutation in 1989, the figure of 340 fatalities or its variations ("more than 300", "closer to 350", "hundreds", etc.), is still often reproduced by some international media.[9][16] Other details from the "dark secret" article in Sovetsky Sport (e.g., that only one stand and one exit were opened for spectators, or that there was a head-on collision of two fans' crowds moving in the opposite directions after the second goal) also sometimes resurface in modern publications.[5]
In 2007 NTV aired its "Fatal Goal" (Роковой гол) documentary in Russia about the Luzhniki disaster.[39] In 2008, ESPN Classic aired a Dutch documentary "Russian Night, the hidden football disaster" throughout Europe.
The only book about this disaster, Drama in het Lenin-stadion,[40] was published in Dutch in the Netherlands in 2007.
