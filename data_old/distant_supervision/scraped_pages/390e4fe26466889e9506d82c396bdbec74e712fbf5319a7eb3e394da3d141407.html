        <h2>Detailed Information About React.js Training/Workshop</h2>

<div class="info">
<p>React is without doubt the most exciting JavaScript framework nowadays. It may not yet be the most popular, but its foundations are so strong that even competitors like AngularJS and EmberJS have taken notice and are in the process of adding features that were first popularized by React. It was open sourced by Facebook and Instagram, and in the two years following its announcement, it has gained adoption by many important web sites, including Khan Academy, Airbnb, Hipchat, Netflix, at an ever growing pace.</p>

<p>React is both easy and simple to learn and use. After learning a few core ideas, building complex web interfaces rapidly becomes almost trivial. In this workshop, we will be learning ins and outs of React and at the end of become ready to use React in our existing and new projects. One of the major selling points of React is that it lives happily with existing technologies so that one can transition to React in an existing application piece by piece, rather than committing to it fully and we will see how React makes this easy.</p>

<p>One of the most important reasons React has become popular has been its speed. In this workshop, we will go over this issue and learn about virtual DOM which makes React this fast, but most importantly we will see that speed is actually not the biggest selling point of React. We will argue that speed of development, simplicity and ease of reasoning about code written with it is of utmost importance and we will observe how thinking in terms of isolated components makes building UIs effortless and designer friendly.</p>
</div>
        <p>The workshop will comprise the following sections:</p>

        <div class="overview">
          <div>Major ideas</div>
          <div>Static applications</div>
          <div>Changing state</div>
          <div>AJAX calls and other data sources</div>

          <div>Flux</div>
          <div>Performance Optimization and Immutability</div>
          <div>Testing and JestJS</div>
          <div>React Router</div>
          <div>Server side React and Flux</div>
          <div>Integration with UI Frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery UI</div>
          <div>Integration with Other Frameworks like Angular</div>
        </div>





<h3>Getting Started with React: Day 1</h3>

<ol class="text-align-left">
  <li>Brief overview of the major ideas in React: Components, re-rendering all the time, virtual DOM, props and state. We will build some isolated small components (Hello World, counters) to exemplify core React ideas.</li>

  <li>Building an example application where almost everything is static. We will see how straightforward it is to get an existing HTML mockup and transfer it to a React application, where the application is dissected into components.</li>

  <li>Modifying the example application so that we have changing state. We will convert an existing static application, by modifying a few isolated parts so that their data changes.</li>

  <li>Integration with AJAX calls, and other data sources: After making sure our application can make changes in state locally in the page, we will see how to integrate AJAX calls (e.g. jQuery get/post requests) seamlessly with our React application. React is agnostic with regards to its data sources, each data change needs to be accompanied with just a setState call to be integrated with React.</li>

  <li>Form handling in React: Forms are the most important part of applications where user changes the data living on the server. In this section, we will see how React handles forms, and compare controlled and uncontrolled inputs. We will also cover form validation and one-way vs. two-way data binding with React state and form elements.</li>
</ol>
  <h3>Advanced Topics in React Ecosystem: Day 2</h3>

  <ol  class="text-align-left">
    <li>Flux: As React applications grow bigger, data management may need to be handled differently. Flux is a pattern popularized by Facebook which uses action creators and stores to handle big applications where the same data might be used in more than one discrete parts of UI in a single page. We will go over an example chat application which uses Flux to manage different parts of a UI that has to be syncronized with chat message data.</li>

    <li>Performance Optimization and Immutability: React is fast by default, but it can be made even faster if you give it some hints. In this section, we will go over details of shouldComponentUpdate method and we will also see how using immutable data structures make this optimization trivial, at the cost of introducing a different way of thinking about data, in which each data structure can only be updated to a new version, but not updated in place. We will go over ImmutableJS, another library released by Facebook, that brings immutable data structures that were mostly popularized by functional languages like Clojure.</li>

    <li>Testing and JestJS: Testing is an important part of every application. Regressions are a big frustration in UI code, although with React you will observe that bugs are much less common. In this section we will see how to test React components, and also cover JestJS, a unit testing tool released by Facebook for testing React and JavaScript applications.</li>

    <h4>Integration with Other Technologies</h4>

    <li>Integration with Other UI Frameworks like Bootstrap or jQuery UI: React may or may not coexist with other UI frameworks or libraries, depending on whether those modify the DOM after bootstrapping. In this section, we will see in which situations React can co-exist with these libraries.</li>

    <li>Integration with Other Frameworks such as Angular: Although React and Angular are competitors, they can happily co-exist. In this section, we will see how to integrate React in a foreign environment to reap some of its benefits. This section is important because most of the projects we as developers are working on are existing projects and it is imperative that we can easily integrate React in a brownfield project. We will also briefly compare Angular, Ember and React.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>I started using React about 18 months ago, about 6 months after it was released. I converted our application SellerCrowd.com which was using backbone and angular to react, so I have pretty good experience with all of these frameworks. My first React related talk was in May 2014 Djangocon Europe in France, where I discussed how to manage complexity in a Django application and how to use React for the view layer. See the video and slides here: <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/djangocon/sczrzw/">http://lanyrd.com/2014/djangocon/sczrzw/</a></li>

        <li>Later on, I gave React talks at local meetups: 2 times in Istanbul, once in Ankara and once in Barcelona. See the talk I gave in Barcelona here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSeurgO39Hk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSeurgO39Hk</a></li>

        <li>In May 2015, I gave a single day workshop on React in Copenhagen Denmark at At the Frontend conference. See the overview here: http://www.atthefrontend.dk/blog/sessions/react-workshop/</li>

          <li>See the repository which contains the slides and examples here : <a href="https://github.com/ustun/react-workshop">https://github.com/ustun/react-workshop</a></li>

        <li>Videos for this workshop is available on request.</li>

        <li>At the same conference, I gave a talk called 'How to Read the Internals of React'.  See the video here : <a href="https://vimeo.com/129469530">https://vimeo.com/129469530</a> and the slides here: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ustun/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-or-how-to-read-the-internals-of-react-dot-js">https://speakerdeck.com/ustun/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-or-how-to-read-the-internals-of-react-dot-js</a></li>

          <li>I have given the same workshop in Turkey, this time in Turkish. I recorded all the workshop, here are the videos (in Turkish): <a href="https://youtube.com/user/ustunozgur">https://youtube.com/user/ustunozgur</a></li>

        <li>For November 2015, I am scheduled to give another workshop in Malmo for the Oredev conference and another React talk.</li>

<li>I gave several talks on the next version of JavaScript, EcmaScript 6 (now known as EcmaScript 2015) in Turkey and twice in Barcelona. See the videos and slides here:
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlrirWY9JTk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlrirWY9JTk</a> and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ustun">https://speakerdeck.com/ustun</a></li>

          <li>I have written various documents and repos regarding React on Github: see <a href="https://github.com/ustun?tab=repositories">https://github.com/ustun?tab=repositories</a></li>

        <li>Regarding my teaching experience, I have worked as a teaching and research assistant at Bilkent University so I have pretty good experience lecturing.</li>

        <li>Regarding my English speaking skills, I speak English very fluently and have been working with a New York based client for the last 4 years.</li>

        <li>Some other background info on me:</li>

        <li>I am a software engineer specialized in building ambituous web applications. After finishing my MSc studies in telecommunications as an electronics engineer, I decided to pursue software engineering as a profession. After initially working on Java EE applications, I decided to switch to Python, where Django has been my preferred framework.</li>

        <li>Later on, seeing the push towards clientside programming in modern web applications, my focus shifted majorly to JavaScript. After using many major frameworks such as Backbone, AngularJS, I have finally settled on React and Flux for building modern JavaScript applications on the browser.</li>

        <li>I am also interested in functional programming and Clojure has been my favorite language. Acceptance of React in ClojureScript community has reassured my conviction that React’s foundation is sound and in harmony with functional programming principles.</li></ul>
