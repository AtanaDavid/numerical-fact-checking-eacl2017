FC Cincy may not tread on Crew's feet but I can still see the proximity to them and being in the same state a big issue when considering other suitors for remaining MLS spots.  It just doesn't look good on paper, despite the argument it doesn't hurt Columbus.
We also do not need to worry about the ownership backing out because of financial reasons. Lindner is backed with all that UDF money.
i wonder if they'll lose support if they start to stink?  could it be possible that the reason they are popular is that they are winning (and playing in an awesome venue)?  but i'm not sure if columbus is too close
The mid and lower NASL teams blow away their USL counterparts.  That's the big difference between the two leagues.
