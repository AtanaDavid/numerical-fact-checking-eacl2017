The Silver State of Nevada is located in the Western Region of the United States and as much of its territory is classed as semi-arid or desert in nature, it’s no surprise to learn that Nevada’s the driest state in the country. Las Vegas is the largest city in the state and its world-famous gambling operation accounts for a sizeable proportion of Nevada’s economic activity with millions flocking to the dazzling lights of “The Strip” every year.
There are two main golf associations in Nevada, divided on geographic lines. The Southern Nevada Golf Association was first to form in 1967 and it currently looks after 10,000 members in 65 clubs whilst the Northern Nevada Golf Association was established five years later with a current membership of 45 clubs. Three women’s associations complete the amateur golfing scene in Nevada.
Resort golf leads the way in Nevada and access for many of the top courses is often only available to golfers residing at designated accommodations. The three main golfing regions in the state are Las Vegas/Henderson, Mesquite and Lake Tahoe and many of the courses built within these locations have been constructed at enormous cost to their developers.
One of these mega-budget layouts is Shadow Creek, Tom Fazio’s extravagant creation which has been wowing Las Vegas golfers for more than two decades. Another spectacular track, Wolf Creek, occupies a rocky landscape above Mesquite Airport and it’s been impressing visitors ever since it debuted in 2000. A newcomer to the best in state listings is yet another “Creek” course, Clear Creek, which Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw laid out in 2009 on the eastern foothills of the Sierras, close to Lake Tahoe.
