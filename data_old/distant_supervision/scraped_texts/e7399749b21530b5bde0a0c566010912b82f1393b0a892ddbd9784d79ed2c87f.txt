We will be using AMF's Summit lane machine to clean and dress the lanes.  It is the most cost effective  and reliable high volume machine in the bowling business.  The Summit can accurately apply more than 100 units (or 30ml) of conditioner per lane in less than 2 minutes.  The Summit's new Foam Transfer Technology (F.T.T.) uses reticulated foam for more accuracy, consistency, and flow rate during temperature changes. The Summit is the most controllable conditioning machine in terms of lengthwise taper of any machine on the market.  Lane oil applied to the lane is measured zone by zone to ensure accuracy.
Below is a colour graph which shows lane conditions for this year's AMF Bowling World Cup.  Typically the lanes will be conditioned for 39 feet Â– although the exact distance will be determined on site due to the topography of the lane.  It is not anticipated that there will be more than 1 foot difference either way.
The different colours represent the quantity of Lane Conditioner at various distances down the lane.  The highest colour line on the chart will be around the arrows (at about 15 feet), the second line further down the lane, and the third towards the end of the Conditioner pattern.     The last 20 feet of the lane are clear of any conditioner. The graph represents the amount of conditioner across the lane.  The three coloured lines show a picture of the conditioner down the length of the lane with the most conditioner nearest to the foul line and reducing in height/units/quantity as you go down the lane.
