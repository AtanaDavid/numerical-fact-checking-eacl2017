The two central objectives of “Estonia 2020” are increasing the productivity and employment in Estonia. The main focus in the coming years is on education and employment and the main objectives include integrating long-term and young unemployed people in the labour market and developing their skills.
The final objectives are set for 2020 and intermediate objectives for 2015.
While preparing “Estonia 2020”, the objectives and priority actions agreed between the European Union heads of government as well as European Commission recommendations to Estonia have been taken into account. The development plan serves as an important basis for targeting national investments as well as the European Union funds.
The National Reform Programme “Estonia 2020” is Estonia’s strategy for achieving the “Europe 2020” objectives.
