Meanwhile, Cincinnati is getting geared up for Don Garber's visit in November.  Crazy times in the US Soccer landscape.
As for Don Garber's visit, I'm looking forward to it just from the perspective of seeing how the Club / City goes about (openly) wooing a new major league sports franchise. It's not something you see every day, and not something I ever expected Cincinnati to be a part of (amazing how things can change in 12 months) considering its status as a mid-major type city. I go back and forth on just how strong Cincinnati's candidacy for MLS is, from sometimes thinking there's a legit shot they could be fast-tracked to 2018 so that an Eastern team can enter with LAFC to convinced there's no way they beat out Detroit, St. Louis, Sacramento and San Diego for a spot.
It's going to be a fun day, though. I'm taking the day off work (along with a bunch of other members of my SG) to be part of whatever festivities occur throughout the day.
