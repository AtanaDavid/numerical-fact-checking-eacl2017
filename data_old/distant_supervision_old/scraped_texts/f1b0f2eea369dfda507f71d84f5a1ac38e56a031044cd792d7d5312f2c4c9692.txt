Very surprised that there's no Yelp page for this park.
I grew up coming to this park for church picnics and large gatherings. As a kid who loved sports this placed seem like an endless playground; there are a couple tennis courts, two baseball fields, a playground, a lake with two docks, an ice cream stand, a lengthy trail that extends around the park, and a huge grass area where many people played volleyball and soccer.
Now that I'm older, I've realized the quality of the park is not necessarily up to par with some others around Auburn/Federal Way. There are huge roots growing under the tennis courts, the fields are not maintained consistently enough, and the lake doesn't seem as attractive for swimming like it used to.
Despite this, I will still recommend this for picnics and gatherings. It has many great covered seating areas and is great place to visit and have a barbeque on a sunny day.
