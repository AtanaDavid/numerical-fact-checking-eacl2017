THE MEDICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF LEGAL ABORTION IN THE UNITED STATES
The history of abortion as an illegal activity in the United States has
resulted in a widespread lack of knowledge about the medical procedures
used and the characteristics of women who obtain abortions. This chapter
describes common methods of abortion, provides some medical definitions,
and outlines the basic demographic features of women in the U.S. who undergo
legal abortion. It concludes with a discussion of the trend in illegal
abortions in recent years, the extent to which legal abortions have
replaced illegal abortions, and a short summary of the demographic effects
of the legalization of abortion in the United States.
Medical Definition and Methods of Abortion
As generally defined in medical textbooks, abortion is the termination
of a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, that is, before it is indepen-
dently capable of sustaining life outside the uterus. In a number of
textbooks, a non-viable fetus is defined as one weighing less than 500 grams,
or just over one pound. Immature birth, not abortion, is generally used to
describe the expulsion of a fetus weighing 500 to 999 grams (approximately
17 ounces to 2.2 pounds), whether it is born alive or dead.*
*A fetus of 500 to 999 grams usually does not survive, even with
extraordinary life support measures. For an infant who does survive,
however, improved medical technology offers a reasonable chance for
maturation and normal life. For statistical purposes and international
uniformity, the definition of a premature infant has been based on a
weight of 1,000 to 2,499 grams (2.2 to 5.5 Ibs). A more accurate
measurement would take into account both birth weight and gestational age;
there are medically important differences between infants of similar
weight but different gestational ages. 17 The low birth weight of
prematurity is a leading cause of infant mortality.

Abortion may occur spontaneously, in which case it is commonly
referred to as a miscarriage, or it may be deliberately induced.
Figure 1 summarizes the methods used to induce abortions at different
stages of pregnancy. The three most frequently used methods in the
United States are suction (vacuum aspiration) and dilatation and sharp
curettage (D&amp;C) for pregnancies in the first three months, and replace-
ment of amniotic fluid with a concentrated salt solution (saline abortion)
for second trimester pregnancies. In late 1973, the Food and Drug Admini-
stration approved the limited use (only in hospitals) of prostaglandins,
as an alternative to a saline solution for second-trimester abortions.
Hysterotomy, and hysterectomy with abortion, both of which involve major
surgery, are not frequent methods of abortion in this country.

For a suction abortion, or vacuum aspiration, the cervical canal*
is gradually forced open by the insertion of surgical instruments (dilators)
until the opening is large enough for passage of a tube (cannula) into the
uterine cavity. The fetus and placental tissue are then suctioned out
by means of a vacuum pump connected to the cannula.**
In dilatation and sharp curettage, or D&amp;C, the cervix is dilated to a
greater extent and the fetal and placental tissue are scraped out of the
uterus with a curette, which resembles a small spoon. Suction or D&amp;C are
performed almost exclusively in the first trimester, under either local or
general anesthesia. At the end of the first trimester, approximately 13
weeks, the fetus is still very small, weighing approximately one-half ounce.
Intrauterine instillation of a saline solution, or saline abortion, is
the most commonly used method in the second trimester, and is usually per-
formed at or after sixteen weeks of pregnancy.*** A portion of the amniotic
fluid that surrounds the fetus is withdrawn by means of a hollow needle
inserted through the womarf s abdominal wall into the uterine cavity.
*See the diagram of the reproductive organs under Ectopic Pregnancy in the
Glossary.
**A procedure that may become of more importance in the U.S. is menstrual
regulation. Menstrual regulation (also known as menstrual induction,
menstrual extraction, and endometrial aspiration) is a suction procedure
performed five to six weeks after the first day of the last menstrual
period (i.e., during the two-week interval following the expected onset of
a missed menstrual period). The procedure usually does not require
anesthesia or dilatation of the cervix. A plastic cannula is inserted into
the uterus and the contents of the uterus are pumped out. Menstrual regula-
tion is performed before the time that pregnancy tests are reasonably
reliable, which is six weeks after the beginning of the last menstrual
period. Some physicians believe that menstrual regulation poses a small
medical risk, which is unwarranted if the woman is not pregnant. (Dr.
Elton Kesse1, director of the International Fertility Research Program at
the University of North Carolina, found no pregnancy in two-thirds of
women whose menstrual periods were five days late, nor in one-third who were
two weeks late.2/ If a woman is pregnant and menstrual regulation does
not completely empty the uterus, there is a risk of continuing pregnancy
or prolonged bleeding.3/
***There is some medical disagreement about the best method of abortion for
the gestational period between 12 and 15 weeks. Some physicians believe that
no method of abortion is medically desirable during this time period and
would wait to perform a saline abortion after 15 weeks gestation. Other
physicians use a combination of vacuum aspiration and some mechanical
manipulation involving the scraping of the uterus since the fetus is too
large to be solely suctioned out.
</p>
                      <p class="ocr-page">22
This fluid is replaced with a concentrated salt solution, which induces
labor and results in the expulsion of the fetus and placenta approximately
24 to 48 hours later. The fetus usually does not survive the procedure.
A prostaglandin abortion is similar in procedure to a saline abortion
and also is performed in the second trimester. One type of prostaglandin,
which causes strong muscular contractions, is injected in milligram doses
into the uterine cavity without withdrawing any amniotic fluid. The
interval between injection and expulsion of the fetus is generally
of a shorter duration than with a saline solution.4_/
Hysterotomy, or surgical entry into the uterus, is performed in either
the first or second trimester, but more usually in the second. In effect,
it is a cesarean section that removes a fetus too small to survive.* Many
physicians believe that any subsequent pregnancies will require cesarean
section delivery. If no further pregnancies are desired, a hysterotomy
abortion is often combined with tubal sterilization.
Hysterectomy for pregnancy termination consists of the removal of the
uterus, with or without the fetus inside, and is usually performed when a
pathological condition of the uterus, such as fibroid tumors, warrants its
remova1, or when the woman desires sterilization. Since hysterotomy and
hysterectomy are major surgical procedures, they represent more of a risk
to the woman than the other abortion methods and are not often used in the
United States. (See Chapter 4 for further discussion.)
In both 1972 and 1973 about 83 percent of the abortions in the United
States were performed in the first trimester,x most commonly by means of
suction or D&amp;C. During 1972, 65 percent of the abortions were performed
by suction, 23 percent by D&amp;C, and 10 percent by the saline method.6/
During 1973, the percentage of abortions performed by suction increased
to 74 percent while those performed by D&amp;C declined to 13 percent; the
percentage of abortions performed by saline remained at 10 percent.?/
Characteristics of Abortion in the United States
Most of the national data on legal abortion in this report were
obtained from Abortion Surveillance Reports, published by the Center
for Disease Control (CDC). CDC began collecting abortion statistics
from 10 state public health departments beginning with 1969 data. By
1972, 19 states and the District of Columbia provided statewide data on
the number of abortions performed in their jurisdictions, and eight other
states provided partial data.
*There are a few known cases in which a physician has miscalculated the
duration of the woman&#039;s pregnancy; viable fetuses have been removed and
have survived.
</p>
                      <p class="ocr-page">23
    Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia reported statewide
abortion statistics for 1973 with partial reporting provided by hospitals
in additional states. Table 2 summarizes the status of national abortion
reporting as of April 1975.8/

There is no uniform national reporting system; states have established
their own systems, or do not require reports of abortion. The number of
legal abortions reported to CDC is less than the actual number performed
nationwide, though it is probable that in 1972 the majority of legal
abortions obtained in the United States were performed in the reporting
states. The basis for this judgment is that 16 of 17 states with non-
or moderately restrictive legislation in 1972 reported statewide data,
and the other, New Mexico, reported partial data. Data were also reported
from the District of Columbia, where a large number of abortions were
performed in 1972.
Although the Supreme Court decisions that legalized abortion in
all 50 states were handed down in January, 1973, many states have not yet
developed adequate reporting systems for channeling abortion data to their
public health departments, which in turn report to CDC. Therefore, the
number of abortions reported to CDC for 1973 (25 states reported statewide
data) continued to be lower than the actual number performed.
The Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research and development division of
Planned Parenthood-World Population, conducted a nationwide survey of 1,642
providers (hospitals, clinics, and private physicians) that enables a
more complete estimate of the number of legal abortions obtained in the U.S.
during 1973.Â£/ Unlike CDC, which depends upon reports from the public
health departments, this survey obtained its information directly from
the providers of abortion services in all 50 states and the District
of Columbia, and is therefore more comprehensive than the CDC reports.
The survey also estimated the number of abortions that would occur in
1974 based on a straight-line projection of the last three quarters of
1973 and first quarter of 1974. No national abortion data for 1974
were available from CDC by May 1975.
Figure 2 shows the rise in the number of reported legal abortions
since 1970 and the increase in the national abortion ratio since that year.*
The increases in the number of reported abortions reflect two factors:
(1) an increase in the number of states providing information to CDC; and
(2) an increase in the frequency of legal abortions within the United States,
The specific effect of each of these factors has not been identified in
Figure 2, although the number of states that reported data in each of
those years has been indicated.
*Two termsâabortion ratio and abortion rateâare used to measure the
relative frequency of abortions. Abortion ratio generally refers to the
number of abortions per 1,000 live births in the same year; abortion rate
refers to the number of abortions per 1,000 women 15-44 years of age.

From 1971 to 1972, the number of abortions reported to CDC increased 21
percent, but from 1972 to 1973, the increase in reported abortions was only
five percent, even though the number of reporting states nearly doubled. If
the more complete survey data compiled by The Alan Guttmacher Institute are
used, a 27 percent increase occurred in the number of abortions obtained in
1973 compared with the 1972 CDC data.
A direct causal relationship cannot be inferred between the increasing
legalization of abortion (culminating with the Supreme Court decisions) and
the increasing number of abortions shown by Figure 2. The Supreme Court
decisions did not necessarily increase the number of abortions; many of
those obtained under non-restrictive abortion practices would earlier
have been obtained illegally. Legalization of abortion and the
establishment of reporting systems has caused them to become visible.
As the substitution effect diminishes over time the rate of increase
in the number of reported abortions is likely to decline.* The
abortion ratio per 1,000 births has continued to rise, not only because
of the increase in the number of abortions, but also because of the
decrease in the total number of births during this period.
Geographic Location and Residency Status
During 1972, according to data reported to CDC from 28 states, the
majority of legal abortions were performed in the non-restrictive
jurisdictions of the District of Columbia, New York, Washington, Alaska,
and Hawaii, and in some moderately restrictive states, such as
California and Kansas, where abortions were obtained without great
difficulty (Table 3). Seventy-five percent of the total abortions
were performed in New York and California, and an additional 12 percent
were obtained in the District of Columbia, Washington, and Kansas (see
Figure 3). During that year, 44 percent of the abortions were obtained
by out-of-state residents who traveled to states with non-restrictive
practices to obtain their abort ions ,â¢10_/ Because of this migration,
the abortion rates (numbers of total abortions per 1,000 resident women
age 15-44) in states with non-restrictive practices were disproportionately
high. For example, the District of Columbia had an abortion rate of
214 because women from Maryland, Virginia, and elsewhere in the South
(where moderate or restrictive abortion legislation was in force) traveled
to the District for their abortions.
*The substitution of legal for previously illegal abortions is discussed
on p. 38.

After the Supreme Court decisions on abortion in January 1973, the
geographic distribution of legal abortions changed to reflect the growing
number of abortions performed in states that had previously had restrictive
abortion practices (Table 3 and Figure 3). According to The Alan Gutt-
macher Institute survey, the number of abortions in New York during 1973
was 216,000, a decline of 83,000 from the 1972 figure of 299,900 reported
by CDC. A total of 86,900 abortions were obtained in Illinois, Michigan,
and Ohio during 1973; none of these states reported any abortions to CDC
in 1972, (all of these were states with restrictive policies in 1972).
It is likely that part of the New York decline during 1973 can be
attributed to the initiation of abortion services in these three mid-
western states during that year.

The change in geographic distribution of abortions following
the Supreme Court decisions also can be illustrated by examining the
abortion statistics for upstate New York and Georgia itemized by state of
residence. In 1972, upstate New York reported an average of 19,000
abortions per quarter, with 60 percent obtained by out-of-state residents.
Georgia residents obtained an average of 400 abortions per quarter in
upstate New York. After January 1973, however, access to abortion
improved in Georgia and the number of abortions obtained in upstate
New York by Georgia women declined from 248 in the first quarter of 1973
to only one in the fourth quarter of that year. Figure 4 illustrates
this trend.ll/

One effect of the Supreme Court decisions was the more equal
distribution of abortion accessibility and, at least for some women,
the increased opportunity to obtain abortions closer to home. There are
positive health benefits in obtaining abortions nearer a woman&#039;s home:
If a complication should arise, she has access to the same facility
that performed the abortion, where her medical history is available to
facilitate care.
Type of Health Care Facility Information on the type of health care
facility where abortions are performed is available for New York City
during a two-year period from July 1, 1970 through June 30, 1972. Some
nationwide data are available from the survey conducted by The Alan
Guttmacher Institute.
From 1970-1971 to 1971-1972, non-hospital clinics performed 39 percent
of the abortions in New York City, with the remainder distributed among
various types of hospital facilities (Figure 5). When examined by place of
residence, 51 percent of non-residents (112,070 women) obtained their
abortions in non-hospital clinics while only 16 percent of New York resi-
dents (18,100 women) obtained their abortions in those clinics.12/
Possible reasons for this difference are that the resident woman either
has her own doctor, who will recommend her to an affiliated hospita1, or
she seeks her medical care at a municipal hospital. The largest
number of abortions obtained by New York City residents, by facility, was
the 40,246 abortions performed in the municipal hospitals.
According to The Guttmacher Institute survey of clinics, hospitals,
and private physicians, the public hospitals have been the slowest
to respond to the mandate implied in the Supreme Court&#039;s decision. Of 2,144
public hospitals identified by the American Hospital Association in 1972,
only 17 percent (362 hospitals) provided abortions during 1973 and the first
quarter of 1974.* This may have restricted the availability of abortions
to low-income women who are more likely to obtain their medical services
in these facilities than middle or upper class women. The number of
abortions performed in all hospital settings declined throughout 1973 from
102,600 in the first quarter to 92,000 in the fourth quarter, while the
abortions performed in non-hospital-based clinics increased steadily during
this period.L3_/ By the first quarter of 1974 the number of abortions
performed in free-standing clinics was greater than those performed in
hospitals.
*The relative paucity of abortion services in public hospitals may
reflect not only their reluctance to respond to the Supreme Court
decisions, but also a lack of funds to provide the necessary facilities
and personnel.

Characteristics of Women Obtaining Abortion in the United States
Age Of abortions for which the age of the patient was known, approxi-
mately one-third of the women obtaining abortions in the United States in
1972 were less than 20 years old, another third were between 20 and 25 years
of age, and the rest were 25 or older. Data for 1973 (Figure 6) show
that the age distribution for women obtaining abortions almost exactly
parallels the distribution by age during 1972.

Race Race was specified for 489,446 women obtaining abortions in
1972, of which 76 percent (370,644) were white and 24 percent were black
or other non-white. Slightly fewer abortions were identified by race
in the CDC reports for 1973; of these 27 percent were obtained by black
and other non-white women.14/*
A comparison of the number of abortions and abortion rates for non-
white women (residents and non-residents) in certain states during 1972 and
1973 suggests that these rates tend to be higher when non-restrictive abor-
tion practices are in effect (Table 4). During 1972, for example,
California and Kansas experienced higher non-white abortion rates than
Georgia and North Carolina. New York state had the highest rate,
probably reflecting both the ease with which resident women could obtain
abortions in New York, and the influx of non-white women from out of state.
From July 1, 1971 to June 30, 1972, about 18,000 abortions were provided to
this latter group of women in New York City.JJ)/ During 1973, however, both
the number and the rate of abortions obtained by non-white women declined
in New York state, part of which can undoubtedly be explained by the
reduction in abortions obtained by out-of-state residents in that year.
The higher rates observed in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and South
Carolina during 1973 must reflect improved access to legal abortions for
non-white women in these states, some of which may have been obtained in
New York in previous years.
In most states, an examination of the incidence of abortion between
white and non-white women during 1972 (and to a lesser extent, during 1973)
requires a comparison of abortion rates for resident women only. In states
with moderate or restrictive legislation prior to the Supreme Court
decisions (Georgia, Maryland, North and South Carolina and Virginia),
many more white women tend to leave their state for an abortion than
non-white women, thereby artifically lowering the abortion rates for
white women. In non-restrictive states, there was no distortion in the
rates for residents, but the inclusion of non-residents in the total
rates tended to cause an upward distortion for white women.**
*CDC does not provide data on race at a more disaggregated level. The
category, &quot;black and other,&quot; contains Negro, American Indian, Chinese,
Japanese, Hawaiian, part Hawaiian, and other.
**In their article on illegitimacy rates in Science, Sklar and Berkov point
to the greater use of out-of-state abortion by white women in non-abortion
states as one factor purporting to explain their declining illegitimate
birth rates.16/

An illustration of non-residents distorting the distribution is provided
by New York, where 61 percent of all abortions in 1972 were obtained by
non-residents. Most of those were obtained in New York City. Of the
132,040 abortions provided to non-residents of New York City during the
period July 1, 1971 to June 30, 1972, about 114,000 (86 percent) were
obtained by white and Puerto Rican women, and only 14 percent by non-white
women. But among residents, about 51,500 abortions (55 percent of the
total) were obtained by whites.17/

                      <p class="ocr-page">36
Table 5 provides data on the number of induced abortions and rates,
by race, during 1972 for residents of three localities. In all three
places, the rates for blacks and other non-whites were approximately
twice as high as for whites. To some extent this may reflect an under-
reporting of white abortions because private practitioners, to whom
whites would go more frequently than would non-whites, probably report
less completely than do public facilities. Although there are few
scientific studies available to explain this differentia1, it is possible
that poverty, cultural attitudes, and ignorance about reproduction may
have limited the access by non-white women to family planning methods,
particularly before Federal funds became available in the early 1970&quot;s.
This may have led historically to a greater reliance on illegal abortion
as a method of birth contro1, which has continued to be reflected in
the reported data on legal abort ion .JjJ/ A 1968 survey in North Carolina
estimated that one conception in seven among white women resulted in
an illegal abortion, compared with one out of three among black women.19/*
If non-white women are more likely to resort to abortion but are less
likely to take advantage of out-of-state abortion opportunities, it
would appear that non-white women have easier access to legal abortion
only when all legal obstacles to abortion are reduced in their home states.
Marital Status and Number of Living Children Approximately 28 percent
of the women whose abortions were reported to CDC in 1973 were married at
the time of the procedure, and the remaining 72 percent were single, sepa-
rated, divorced or widowed.21/** Data for 1972 from CDC parallel the 1973
proportions. These statistics indicate the woman&#039;s marital status at the
time of abortion, which does not necessarily reflect her marital status
at conception. A sizeable number of women who conceive out of wedlock
married their partners and did not obtain abortions. Acording to Sklar
and Berkov, the legalization of abortions not only helps to prevent
out-of-wedlock births, but also helps reduce the incidence of pregnancy-
related marriages.^2_/ Fifty percent of the women obtaining abortions
in 1973 had one or more children at the time of the abortion.23/
*A study done by Bauman and Udry in the early 1970&#039;s found a higher percen-
tage of unwanted pregnancies and births among blacks than among whites.
This statistic was associated with blacks&quot; lesser use of non-physician-
administered contraceptive methods, greater non-use of contraception,
higher failure rates with pills or IUD&#039;s and lower family size desired.
The study was based on a 1969-1970 survey of low income, married or formerly
married women in seventeen U.S. cities and comparable data from the 1965
and 1970 National Fertility Studies.20/
**Approximately seven percent of the abortions were reported with
marital status unknown, and were distributed proportionately.

Legalization of Abortion and the Trend in Illegal Abortions
Even though abortions were illegal in a majority of states before
the Supreme Court decisions in January 1973, many women were able to
obtain them. But illegal abortions are not reported to public health
authorities and almost never to the police. Estimates of their numbers
have to be based on occasional surveys and extrapolations from hospital
admission and discharge data, which makes impossible a calculation
of illegal abortion ratios or rates, or the development of trend data
on the incidence.
The most widely quoted figure on the number of illegal abortions
comes from a committee established after a 1955 Arden House conference
on abortion, sponsored by Planned Parenthood. The committee concluded that
&quot;a plausible estimate of the frequency of induced abortion in the United
States could be as low as 200,000 and as high as 1,200,000 per year...
[with] no objective basis for the selection of a particular figure between
the two estimates as an approximation of the actual frequency. &quot;2â¢4/ Another
estimate by two authors was that in 1955 there were probably 699,000
illegally induced abortions and in 1967, 829,000 illegally induced
abortions. These figures were based on randomized response estimates of
induced abortion in women aged 15-44 in North Carolina, and then
applied to the United States as a whole. The estimates are in the mid-range
of the Arden House estimate cited above.25J Evidence provided in
Chapters 3 and 4 show that the medical indicators of the frequency of
illegal abortions, i.e. hospital admissions for incomplete or septic
abortions and deaths from other-than-legal abortions, have declined
significantly in locations with non-restrictive abortion practices.
These data suggest that the number of illegal abortions has declined
in recent years and that most women will choose a legal abortion over
an illegal abortion when that choice is available. Tietze has
calculated that 70 percent of the legal abortions obtained in New
York City from July 1, 1970 to June 30, 1972 by resident women replaced
illegal abortions which had previously taken place, and that the
remainder was responsible for about one-half of the decline in live
births that occurred between 1970 and 1972.26/
Other Demographic Effects of the Legalization of Abortion
Although Tietze has argued that the predominant effect of the legaliza-
tion of abortion has been a substitution of legal abortions for what other-
wise would have been illegal abortions, he and other authors agree that
there has been a demographic effect as wel1, namely that there has been a more
rapid decline in the birth rate in states with non-restrictive abortion
practices than in other states, and particularly in the rates of out-of-
wedlock births.27/

                      <p class="ocr-page">39
Pakter and Nelson have shown that the continued rise in the number of
out-of-wedlock births in New York City during the 196(Ts (from 16,412 in
1962 to 31,903 in 1970) was not reversed until 1971, the first full year of
New York&#039;s non-restrictive abortion law. In that year, out-of-wedlock births
declined by 12 percent to 28,099^28/ the first decrease since illegitimate
births began to be recorded in 1954.J29_/ The authors conclude that &quot;it was
only after abortions became available that the number of out-of-wedlock
births began to diminish. Two-thirds of the terminations of pregnancy for
New York City residents were among the unmarried, and 90 percent of the
teenagers undergoing abortions were unmarried.&quot;30/
Similar data have been reported from California, where the out-of-
wedlock fertility rate fell 16 percent, from 27 to 22.6 per 1,000 unmarried
women between 1970 and 1971, the first year that non-restrictive abortion
practices were widely adopted. Again, this was the first decline since 1966
when records on legitimacy status began to be kept. Concomitant with this
decline was an increase in the teenage abortion rate from 30.8 per 1,000
women aged 15-19 during July 1970-June 1971, to 41.2 per 1,000 in 1971-1972,
an increase of 22.8 percent.3JV From a detailed analysis of the relation-
ship between legal abortion and out-of-wedlock births in California
since 1970, Sklar and Berkov have concluded that the availability of legal
abortion was a significant factor in the decline in illegitimacy for
California between 1970 and 1972.â¢32_/
A comparison of out-of-wedlock birthrates from 1965 to 1971 for the
United States as a whole and for those states that had introduced less
restrictive abortion legislation suggests that abortion may have had an
immediate downward push on illegitimacy (Table 6). From 1965 to 1970,
out-of-wedlock birthrates in all states had an annual average
increase of approximately three percent. After 1970, however, when a
dozen states had adopted moderately restrictive or non-restrictive
legislation, out-of-wedlock birthrates declined 12 percent in states with
liberalized abortion laws and only two percent in states with restrictive
laws.33/
Although these data can be interpreted as showing some relationship
between the legalization of abortion and a decline in out-of-wedlock births
in the subsequent year, no conclusions can be drawn with respect to the
long-term trend in out-of-wedlock births in an area with non-restrictive
abortion legislation. In New York, the number of out-of-wedlock births
reversed its two-year decline and increased in 1973 from 27,619 to
28,292.â¢34/ For the U.S. as a whole, the illegitimate birthrate increased
in 1972 and then dropped slightly in 1973, but not to the low level
achieved in 1971. Too many other factors affect the decision to bear a
child, and particularly an out-of-wedlock child, to allow conclusions
about the demographic effects of legal abortion.

Another public health issue related to the legalization of
abortion are the effects, if any, on the birthrates of women (e.g.,
teenagers) at high risk of bearing a child that is premature and of low
birth weight. Infants with these characteristics have a greater risk
of mortality than normal birth weight children.â¢35_/ Although it should
be possible to prove an effect of increased frequency of teenage abortions
on the total proportion of newborns weighing less than 2,500 grams, the
data to analyze this issue are not now available to the study group.
However, there are data on overall infant mortality rates for the United
States and selected states with non-restrictive abortion practices during
part of that period. If women at high risk of having a premature birth
are obtaining abortions disproportionate to their representation in the
population of women having children, there should be a greater decline
in infant mortality rates in states with non-restrictive practices than
for the remainder of the U.S. The data presented in Table 7 show that
this difference is demonstrable.

Summary
During 1972 and 1973 more than 1.2 million legal abortions obtained
in the United States were reported to the Center for Disease Control.
The three major methods of abortion used were suction, D&amp;C and saline.
About 83 percent of the abortions were performed in the first trimester
with suction as the predominant method of termination.
The majority of abortions during 1972 were obtained in New York,
California, and the District of Columbia all of which had non-restrictive
abortion practices which attracted a large number of out-of-state residents.
Forty-four percent of the abortions obtained in 1972 were obtained outside
of the home state of the patient. After the Supreme Court decisions on
abortion in January 1973, legal abortions began to be distributed more
evenly throughout the students.
During 1973, one-third of the women obtaining abortions were less
than 20 years of age, another third were between 20 and 25 years of age
and the remaining third were over 25. Nearly 30 percent of the women
were married; the rest were single, divorced, separated, or widowed.
An examination by race shows that 73 percent of the women obtaining
abortions were white and 27 percent were black or of other non-
white origins, although in 1972 non-white women had legal abortion
rates more than twice as great as those of white women.
A national survey of abortion providers conducted by The Alan
Guttmacher Institute in 1974 provides comprehensive data on the number of
abortions performed in the U.S. during 1973 by State and type of provider.
A total of 745,400 abortions were reported in the survey, 53 percent of
those in physicians&#039; offices. Many public hospitals did not provide any
abortion services even though many low-income women rely on these
instructions for most of their health care needs.
A comparison of the 1972 and 1973 data on abortion supports the
conclusion that nonrestrictive abortion practices lead to:
1) an increase in the number of reported legal abortions;
2) a decline in the number of women traveling outside their home
state to obtain an abortion; and
3) a significantly greater use oflegal abortion by non-white women
within their state of residence as compared to white women.
Although there are no data on the trend in the number of illegal
abortions, one study has shown that 70 percent of the abortions in New
York City during 1970-1971 and 1971-1972~the first two years of New York&#039;s
non-restrictive legislationâreplaced illegal abortions which would have
been performed illegally, and that the remaining 30 percent accounted for
</p>
                      <p class="ocr-page">43
about one-half of the decline in births that occurred from 1970 to 1972,
One aspect of birthrate trends is the number of out-of-wedlock births.
In New York City and California legalization of abortion has been
followed the next year by a decline in the number of these births,
representing a reversal of previous upward trends in the number of
children born out-of-wedlock in these areas. Similarly, legalization
of abortion has not been shown to result in a dramatic reduction in
infant mortality. However, no final conclusions on the causal relation-
ship between non-restrictive abortion legislation and the trend in
out-of-wedlock births or infant mortality rates can be drawn at this
time.

This chapter\ndescribes common methods of abortion, provides some medical definitions,\nand outlines the basic demographic features of women in the U.S. who undergo\nlegal abortion. It concludes with a discussion of the trend in illegal\nabortions in recent years, the extent to which legal abortions have\nreplaced illegal abortions, and a short summary of the demographic effects\nof the legalization of abortion in the United States.\nMedical Definition and Methods of Abortion\nAs generally defined in medical textbooks, abortion is the termination\nof a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, that is, before it is indepen-\ndently capable of sustaining life outside the uterus. In a number of\ntextbooks, a non-viable fetus is defined as one weighing less than 500 grams,\nor just over one pound. Immature birth, not abortion, is generally used to\ndescribe the expulsion of a fetus weighing 500 to 999 grams (approximately\n17 ounces to 2.2 pounds), whether it is born alive or dead.*\n*A fetus of 500 to 999 grams usually does not survive, even with\nextraordinary life support measures. For an infant who does survive,\nhowever, improved medical technology offers a reasonable chance for\nmaturation and normal life. For statistical purposes and international\nuniformity, the definition of a premature infant has been based on a\nweight of 1,000 to 2,499 grams (2.2 to 5.5 Ibs). A more accurate\nmeasurement would take into account both birth weight and gestational age;\nthere are medically important differences between infants of similar\nweight but different gestational ages. 17 The low birth weight of\nprematurity is a leading cause of infant mortality.\n19\n","20":"20\nAbortion may occur spontaneously, in which case it is commonly\nreferred to as a miscarriage, or it may be deliberately induced.\nFigure 1 summarizes the methods used to induce abortions at different\nstages of pregnancy. The three most frequently used methods in the\nUnited States are suction (vacuum aspiration) and dilatation and sharp\ncurettage (D&C) for pregnancies in the first three months, and replace-\nment of amniotic fluid with a concentrated salt solution (saline abortion)\nfor second trimester pregnancies. In late 1973, the Food and Drug Admini-\nstration approved the limited use (only in hospitals) of prostaglandins,\nas an alternative to a saline solution for second-trimester abortions.\nHysterotomy, and hysterectomy with abortion, both of which involve major\nsurgery, are not frequent methods of abortion in this country.\nFIGURE 1\nMethods of Induced Abortion By Weeks of Pregnancy\nFirst day of the\nLast Menstrual Period (LMP)\nFertilization\nF\nrst Missed Period\nPregnancy Tests Are\nNot Reliable Prior\nto 6th Week LMP\ni: i |\nI Men* 1 Suction No\ntrual | Dilation & Standard\nProstaglandin\nSaline\nHysterotomy8\nHysterectomy3\ni\n| laTon | Curetta9e I Method\nIII 1 1\n1 1\n12\n\/\\\n14\n16\n20\n26\nFIRST TRIMESTER\nSECOND TRIMESTER\nTIME IN WEEKS FROM LAST PERIOD\na\/ These two methods can also be used in the first trimester.\nSource: Adapted from Theresa van der Vlugt, and P. T. Piotrow. \"Uterine\nAspiration Techniques,\" Population Report, Series F, No. 3,\nWashington, D.C.: The George Washington University Medical Center,\nPopulation Information Programs, June 1973.\n","21":"21\nFor a suction abortion, or vacuum aspiration, the cervical canal*\nis gradually forced open by the insertion of surgical instruments (dilators)\nuntil the opening is large enough for passage of a tube (cannula) into the\nuterine cavity. The fetus and placental tissue are then suctioned out\nby means of a vacuum pump connected to the cannula.**\nIn dilatation and sharp curettage, or D&C, the cervix is dilated to a\ngreater extent and the fetal and placental tissue are scraped out of the\nuterus with a curette, which resembles a small spoon. Suction or D&C are\nperformed almost exclusively in the first trimester, under either local or\ngeneral anesthesia. At the end of the first trimester, approximately 13\nweeks, the fetus is still very small, weighing approximately one-half ounce.\nIntrauterine instillation of a saline solution, or saline abortion, is\nthe most commonly used method in the second trimester, and is usually per-\nformed at or after sixteen weeks of pregnancy.*** A portion of the amniotic\nfluid that surrounds the fetus is withdrawn by means of a hollow needle\ninserted through the womarf s abdominal wall into the uterine cavity.\n*See the diagram of the reproductive organs under Ectopic Pregnancy in the\nGlossary.\n**A procedure that may become of more importance in the U.S. is menstrual\nregulation. Menstrual regulation (also known as menstrual induction,\nmenstrual extraction, and endometrial aspiration) is a suction procedure\nperformed five to six weeks after the first day of the last menstrual\nperiod (i.e., during the two-week interval following the expected onset of\na missed menstrual period). The procedure usually does not require\nanesthesia or dilatation of the cervix. A plastic cannula is inserted into\nthe uterus and the contents of the uterus are pumped out. Menstrual regula-\ntion is performed before the time that pregnancy tests are reasonably\nreliable, which is six weeks after the beginning of the last menstrual\nperiod. Some physicians believe that menstrual regulation poses a small\nmedical risk, which is unwarranted if the woman is not pregnant. (Dr.\nElton Kesse1, director of the International Fertility Research Program at\nthe University of North Carolina, found no pregnancy in two-thirds of\nwomen whose menstrual periods were five days late, nor in one-third who were\ntwo weeks late.2\/ If a woman is pregnant and menstrual regulation does\nnot completely empty the uterus, there is a risk of continuing pregnancy\nor prolonged bleeding.3\/\n***There is some medical disagreement about the best method of abortion for\nthe gestational period between 12 and 15 weeks. Some physicians believe that\nno method of abortion is medically desirable during this time period and\nwould wait to perform a saline abortion after 15 weeks gestation. Other\nphysicians use a combination of vacuum aspiration and some mechanical\nmanipulation involving the scraping of the uterus since the fetus is too\nlarge to be solely suctioned out.\n","22":"22\nThis fluid is replaced with a concentrated salt solution, which induces\nlabor and results in the expulsion of the fetus and placenta approximately\n24 to 48 hours later. The fetus usually does not survive the procedure.\nA prostaglandin abortion is similar in procedure to a saline abortion\nand also is performed in the second trimester. One type of prostaglandin,\nwhich causes strong muscular contractions, is injected in milligram doses\ninto the uterine cavity without withdrawing any amniotic fluid. The\ninterval between injection and expulsion of the fetus is generally\nof a shorter duration than with a saline solution.4_\/\nHysterotomy, or surgical entry into the uterus, is performed in either\nthe first or second trimester, but more usually in the second. In effect,\nit is a cesarean section that removes a fetus too small to survive.* Many\nphysicians believe that any subsequent pregnancies will require cesarean\nsection delivery. If no further pregnancies are desired, a hysterotomy\nabortion is often combined with tubal sterilization.\nHysterectomy for pregnancy termination consists of the removal of the\nuterus, with or without the fetus inside, and is usually performed when a\npathological condition of the uterus, such as fibroid tumors, warrants its\nremova1, or when the woman desires sterilization. Since hysterotomy and\nhysterectomy are major surgical procedures, they represent more of a risk\nto the woman than the other abortion methods and are not often used in the\nUnited States. (See Chapter 4 for further discussion.)\nIn both 1972 and 1973 about 83 percent of the abortions in the United\nStates were performed in the first trimester,x most commonly by means of\nsuction or D&C. During 1972, 65 percent of the abortions were performed\nby suction, 23 percent by D&C, and 10 percent by the saline method.6\/\nDuring 1973, the percentage of abortions performed by suction increased\nto 74 percent while those performed by D&C declined to 13 percent; the\npercentage of abortions performed by saline remained at 10 percent.?\/\nCharacteristics of Abortion in the United States\nMost of the national data on legal abortion in this report were\nobtained from Abortion Surveillance Reports, published by the Center\nfor Disease Control (CDC). CDC began collecting abortion statistics\nfrom 10 state public health departments beginning with 1969 data. By\n1972, 19 states and the District of Columbia provided statewide data on\nthe number of abortions performed in their jurisdictions, and eight other\nstates provided partial data.\n*There are a few known cases in which a physician has miscalculated the\nduration of the woman's pregnancy; viable fetuses have been removed and\nhave survived.\n","23":"23\n    Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia reported statewide\nabortion statistics for 1973 with partial reporting provided by hospitals\nin additional states.

The number of\nlegal abortions reported to CDC is less than the actual number performed\nnationwide, though it is probable that in 1972 the majority of legal\nabortions obtained in the United States were performed in the reporting\nstates. The basis for this judgment is that 16 of 17 states with non-\nor moderately restrictive legislation in 1972 reported statewide data,\nand the other, New Mexico, reported partial data. Data were also reported\nfrom the District of Columbia, where a large number of abortions were\nperformed in 1972.\nAlthough the Supreme Court decisions that legalized abortion in\nall 50 states were handed down in January, 1973, many states have not yet\ndeveloped adequate reporting systems for channeling abortion data to their\npublic health departments, which in turn report to CDC. Therefore, the\nnumber of abortions reported to CDC for 1973 (25 states reported statewide\ndata) continued to be lower than the actual number performed.\nThe Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research and development division of\nPlanned Parenthood-World Population, conducted a nationwide survey of 1,642\nproviders (hospitals, clinics, and private physicians) that enables a\nmore complete estimate of the number of legal abortions obtained in the U.S.\nduring 1973.\u00c2\u00a3\/ Unlike CDC, which depends upon reports from the public\nhealth departments, this survey obtained its information directly from\nthe providers of abortion services in all 50 states and the District\nof Columbia, and is therefore more comprehensive than the CDC reports.\nThe survey also estimated the number of abortions that would occur in\n1974 based on a straight-line projection of the last three quarters of\n1973 and first quarter of 1974. No national abortion data for 1974\nwere available from CDC by May 1975.\nFigure 2 shows the rise in the number of reported legal abortions\nsince 1970 and the increase in the national abortion ratio since that year.*\nThe increases in the number of reported abortions reflect two factors:\n(1) an increase in the number of states providing information to CDC; and\n(2) an increase in the frequency of legal abortions within the United States,\nThe specific effect of each of these factors has not been identified in\nFigure 2, although the number of states that reported data in each of\nthose years has been indicated.\n*Two terms\u00e2\u0080\u0094abortion ratio and abortion rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094are used to measure the\nrelative frequency of abortions.

If\nthe more complete survey data compiled by The Alan Guttmacher Institute are\nused, a 27 percent increase occurred in the number of abortions obtained in\n1973 compared with the 1972 CDC data.\nA direct causal relationship cannot be inferred between the increasing\nlegalization of abortion (culminating with the Supreme Court decisions) and\nthe increasing number of abortions shown by Figure 2. The Supreme Court\ndecisions did not necessarily increase the number of abortions; many of\nthose obtained under non-restrictive abortion practices would earlier\nhave been obtained illegally. Legalization of abortion and the\nestablishment of reporting systems has caused them to become visible.\nAs the substitution effect diminishes over time the rate of increase\nin the number of reported abortions is likely to decline.* The\nabortion ratio per 1,000 births has continued to rise, not only because\nof the increase in the number of abortions, but also because of the\ndecrease in the total number of births during this period.\nGeographic Location and Residency Status\nDuring 1972, according to data reported to CDC from 28 states, the\nmajority of legal abortions were performed in the non-restrictive\njurisdictions of the District of Columbia, New York, Washington, Alaska,\nand Hawaii, and in some moderately restrictive states, such as\nCalifornia and Kansas, where abortions were obtained without great\ndifficulty (Table 3). Seventy-five percent of the total abortions\nwere performed in New York and California, and an additional 12 percent\nwere obtained in the District of Columbia, Washington, and Kansas (see\nFigure 3). During that year, 44 percent of the abortions were obtained\nby out-of-state residents who traveled to states with non-restrictive\npractices to obtain their abort ions ,\u00e2\u0080\u00a210_\/ Because of this migration,\nthe abortion rates (numbers of total abortions per 1,000 resident women\nage 15-44) in states with non-restrictive practices were disproportionately\nhigh. For example, the District of Columbia had an abortion rate of\n214 because women from Maryland, Virginia, and elsewhere in the South\n(where moderate or restrictive abortion legislation was in force) traveled\nto the District for their abortions.\n*The substitution of legal for previously illegal abortions is discussed\non p. 38.\n","27":"27\nFIGURE 3\nPercent Distribution of Reported Legal Abortions\nby Place of Occurrence, 1972 and 1973\nTotal: 586,800\nTotal: 745,400\nAll Other States\n13%\nDistrict of Columbia 7%\nCalifornia\n24%\nNew York\n51%\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Kansas 2%\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Washington 3%\nKansas 2% -\nWashington 2% \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nAll Other States\n42%\nDistrict of Columbia 6%\nCalifornia\n19%\nNew York\n29%\n1972\n1973\nSource: Table 3.\nAfter the Supreme Court decisions on abortion in January 1973, the\ngeographic distribution of legal abortions changed to reflect the growing\nnumber of abortions performed in states that had previously had restrictive\nabortion practices (Table 3 and Figure 3). According to The Alan Gutt-\nmacher Institute survey, the number of abortions in New York during 1973\nwas 216,000, a decline of 83,000 from the 1972 figure of 299,900 reported\nby CDC. A total of 86,900 abortions were obtained in Illinois, Michigan,\nand Ohio during 1973; none of these states reported any abortions to CDC\nin 1972, (all of these were states with restrictive policies in 1972).\nIt is likely that part of the New York decline during 1973 can be\nattributed to the initiation of abortion services in these three mid-\nwestern states during that year.\n","28":"28\nTABLE 3\nNumber of Reported Legal Abortions in 1972 and 1973,\nBy State, and Legal Status of Abortion in 1972\n1972 a\/b\/\n1972 c\/\n1973 d\/\n1973 e_\/\nNon-restrictive States\nAbortions\nRates\nAbortions\nRates\nAlaska\n1,172\n12.0\n1,200\n16.5\nHawaii\n4,546\n25.7\n4,600\n26.1\nNew York f\/\n299,891\n75.9\n216,000\n53.7\nWashington\n17,767\n23.8\n17,200\n22.5\nDistrict of Columbia i\/%J\n38,868\n207.9\n44,500\n233.4\nModerately Restrictive States\nArkansas 793 2.0 1,100 2.8\nCalifornia 138,584 30.6 143,400 30.7\nColorado 5,260 10.3 7,600 14.3\nDelaware 1,342 10.8 2,000 15.6\nFlorida 3,378 i\/ 2.4 23,600 16.4\nGeorgia 2,509 ~~ 2.4 11,000 10.3\nKansas t] 12,248 26.6 12,600 27.0\nMaryland 9,093 10.1 11,100 11.8\nNew Mexico \u00c2\u00a3\/ 5,989 h\/ 26.7 4,600 20.3\nNorth Carolina 8,365 7.4 12,100 10.7\nOregon 7,143 15.7 8,000 17.4\nSouth Carolina 854 1.5 2,200 3.6\nVirginia 4,496 4.3 9,000 8.5\nRestrictive States\nAlabama\nArizona\nConnecticut\nIdaho\nIllinois\nIndiana\nIowa\nKentucky\nLouisiana\nMaine\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nMinnesota\nMississippi\nMissouri\nMontana\nNebraska\nNevada\n1,156 h\/\n1.5\n4,500\n6.1\n275 h\/\n.7\n2,900\n7.2\n2,579 h\/\n3.9\n6,800\n10.1\ny\n300\n2.0\nn\/\n32,500\n13.4\nk\/\n1,800\n1.6\nI\/\n3,400\n5.9\n1\n2,600\n3.8\nm\/\nm\/\n600\n3.5\n3,394 J\/\n2.8\n14,100\n11.5\nk\/\n37,200\n18.6\nk\/\n7,600\n9.2\n61\n.1\n100\n0.2\nk\/\n3,200\n3.4\nk\/\n400\n2.8\n789 h\/\n2.6\n2,100\n7.1\nk\/\n1,200\n9.9\n","29":"29\nRestrictive States (con't)\nNew Hampshire \\sj 700 3.7\nNew Jersey k\/ 10,000 6.4\nNorth Dakota k_\/ m\/ m\/\nOklahoma k\/ 700 1.1\nOhio k\/ 17,200 7.2\nPennsylvania 8,540h\/ 3.5 29,800 12.1\nRhode Island k\/ 1,100 5.6\nSouth Dakota k\/_ 1,700 12.2\nTennessee h\/m\/ 3,700 4.2\nTexas k\/ 17,600 7.1\nUtah k\/ 100 0.4\nVermont 231 2.4 1,200 15.8\nWest Virginia Vj m\/ m\/\nWisconsin 7,427h\/ 8.3 8,200 8.6\nWyoming k\/ 300 4.3\nU.S. Total 586,800 745,400 16.5\na\/ Includes all states that reported information to CDC.

There are\npositive health benefits in obtaining abortions nearer a woman's home:\nIf a complication should arise, she has access to the same facility\nthat performed the abortion, where her medical history is available to\nfacilitate care.\nType of Health Care Facility Information on the type of health care\nfacility where abortions are performed is available for New York City\nduring a two-year period from July 1, 1970 through June 30, 1972. Some\nnationwide data are available from the survey conducted by The Alan\nGuttmacher Institute.\nFrom 1970-1971 to 1971-1972, non-hospital clinics performed 39 percent\nof the abortions in New York City, with the remainder distributed among\nvarious types of hospital facilities (Figure 5). When examined by place of\nresidence, 51 percent of non-residents (112,070 women) obtained their\nabortions in non-hospital clinics while only 16 percent of New York resi-\ndents (18,100 women) obtained their abortions in those clinics.12\/\nPossible reasons for this difference are that the resident woman either\nhas her own doctor, who will recommend her to an affiliated hospita1, or\nshe seeks her medical care at a municipal hospital. The largest\nnumber of abortions obtained by New York City residents, by facility, was\nthe 40,246 abortions performed in the municipal hospitals.\nAccording to The Guttmacher Institute survey of clinics, hospitals,\nand private physicians, the public hospitals have been the slowest\nto respond to the mandate implied in the Supreme Court's decision. Of 2,144\npublic hospitals identified by the American Hospital Association in 1972,\nonly 17 percent (362 hospitals) provided abortions during 1973 and the first\nquarter of 1974.* This may have restricted the availability of abortions\nto low-income women who are more likely to obtain their medical services\nin these facilities than middle or upper class women. The number of\nabortions performed in all hospital settings declined throughout 1973 from\n102,600 in the first quarter to 92,000 in the fourth quarter, while the\nabortions performed in non-hospital-based clinics increased steadily during\nthis period.L3_\/ By the first quarter of 1974 the number of abortions\nperformed in free-standing clinics was greater than those performed in\nhospitals.\n*The relative paucity of abortion services in public hospitals may\nreflect not only their reluctance to respond to the Supreme Court\ndecisions, but also a lack of funds to provide the necessary facilities\nand personnel.\n","32":"32\nFIGURE 5\nPercent Distribution of New York City Abortions by Type of\nProvider and Residency Status, July 1, 1970 - June 30, 1972\n ALL WOMEN\n 35%\n 8%\n39%.-.\n 1%\n1%\nRESIDENTS\nNON-RESIDENTS\nVoluntary hospitals, non-private patients\n| | Municipal hospitals\n^i^-O-l Voluntary hospitals, private patients\n\\ Vr.''.r-.\\ Proprietary hospitals\nY\/\/\/A Non-hospital clinic\nSource: Jean Pakter, Donna 0'Hare, Frieda Nelson and Martin Svigir.\n\"Two Years Experience in New York City with the Liberalized\nAbortion Law - Progress and Problems,\" American Journal of\nPublic Health 63: 526, June 1973.\n","33":"33\nCharacteristics of Women Obtaining Abortion in the United States\nAge Of abortions for which the age of the patient was known, approxi-\nmately one-third of the women obtaining abortions in the United States in\n1972 were less than 20 years old, another third were between 20 and 25 years\nof age, and the rest were 25 or older.

During 1972, for example,\nCalifornia and Kansas experienced higher non-white abortion rates than\nGeorgia and North Carolina. New York state had the highest rate,\nprobably reflecting both the ease with which resident women could obtain\nabortions in New York, and the influx of non-white women from out of state.\nFrom July 1, 1971 to June 30, 1972, about 18,000 abortions were provided to\nthis latter group of women in New York City.JJ)\/ During 1973, however, both\nthe number and the rate of abortions obtained by non-white women declined\nin New York state, part of which can undoubtedly be explained by the\nreduction in abortions obtained by out-of-state residents in that year.\nThe higher rates observed in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and South\nCarolina during 1973 must reflect improved access to legal abortions for\nnon-white women in these states, some of which may have been obtained in\nNew York in previous years.\nIn most states, an examination of the incidence of abortion between\nwhite and non-white women during 1972 (and to a lesser extent, during 1973)\nrequires a comparison of abortion rates for resident women only. In states\nwith moderate or restrictive legislation prior to the Supreme Court\ndecisions (Georgia, Maryland, North and South Carolina and Virginia),\nmany more white women tend to leave their state for an abortion than\nnon-white women, thereby artifically lowering the abortion rates for\nwhite women.

Although there are few\nscientific studies available to explain this differentia1, it is possible\nthat poverty, cultural attitudes, and ignorance about reproduction may\nhave limited the access by non-white women to family planning methods,\nparticularly before Federal funds became available in the early 1970\"s.\nThis may have led historically to a greater reliance on illegal abortion\nas a method of birth contro1, which has continued to be reflected in\nthe reported data on legal abort ion .JjJ\/ A 1968 survey in North Carolina\nestimated that one conception in seven among white women resulted in\nan illegal abortion, compared with one out of three among black women.19\/*\nIf non-white women are more likely to resort to abortion but are less\nlikely to take advantage of out-of-state abortion opportunities, it\nwould appear that non-white women have easier access to legal abortion\nonly when all legal obstacles to abortion are reduced in their home states.\nMarital Status and Number of Living Children Approximately 28 percent\nof the women whose abortions were reported to CDC in 1973 were married at\nthe time of the procedure, and the remaining 72 percent were single, sepa-\nrated, divorced or widowed.21\/** Data for 1972 from CDC parallel the 1973\nproportions.

Acording to Sklar\nand Berkov, the legalization of abortions not only helps to prevent\nout-of-wedlock births, but also helps reduce the incidence of pregnancy-\nrelated marriages.^2_\/ Fifty percent of the women obtaining abortions\nin 1973 had one or more children at the time of the abortion.23\/\n*A study done by Bauman and Udry in the early 1970's found a higher percen-\ntage of unwanted pregnancies and births among blacks than among whites.\nThis statistic was associated with blacks\" lesser use of non-physician-\nadministered contraceptive methods, greater non-use of contraception,\nhigher failure rates with pills or IUD's and lower family size desired.\nThe study was based on a 1969-1970 survey of low income, married or formerly\nmarried women in seventeen U.S. cities and comparable data from the 1965\nand 1970 National Fertility Studies.20\/\n**Approximately seven percent of the abortions were reported with\nmarital status unknown, and were distributed proportionately.\n","37":"37\nTABLE 5\nNumber of Legal Abortions and Abortion Rates by Race for\nResidents of New York City, California, and Maryland\nLocality Number of Abortions Abortion Rates\nWhite Non-White White Non-White\nNew York City 39,700 35,400 31.7 71.8\n(1971\/72)\nCalifornia 85,780 17,356 21.9 51.2\n(1971\/72)\nMaryland 7,711 3,545 10.9 19.9\n(1971)\nSources: New York City - Christopher Tietze and Deborah Dawson. \"Induced\nAbortion: A Factbook,\" Reports on Population\/Family Planning,\nNew York: The Population Counci1, December 1973, p. 11.\nCalifornia - June Sklar and Beth Berkov. \"The Effects of Legal\nAbortion on Legitimate and Illegitimate Birth Rates: The\nCalifornia Experience,\" Studies in Family Planning, New York:\nThe Population Counci1, 1973, p. 290.\nMaryland - Ira Rosenwaike and Robert J.

But illegal abortions are not reported to public health\nauthorities and almost never to the police. Estimates of their numbers\nhave to be based on occasional surveys and extrapolations from hospital\nadmission and discharge data, which makes impossible a calculation\nof illegal abortion ratios or rates, or the development of trend data\non the incidence.\nThe most widely quoted figure on the number of illegal abortions\ncomes from a committee established after a 1955 Arden House conference\non abortion, sponsored by Planned Parenthood. The committee concluded that\n\"a plausible estimate of the frequency of induced abortion in the United\nStates could be as low as 200,000 and as high as 1,200,000 per year...\n[with] no objective basis for the selection of a particular figure between\nthe two estimates as an approximation of the actual frequency. \"2\u00e2\u0080\u00a24\/ Another\nestimate by two authors was that in 1955 there were probably 699,000\nillegally induced abortions and in 1967, 829,000 illegally induced\nabortions. These figures were based on randomized response estimates of\ninduced abortion in women aged 15-44 in North Carolina, and then\napplied to the United States as a whole. The estimates are in the mid-range\nof the Arden House estimate cited above.25J Evidence provided in\nChapters 3 and 4 show that the medical indicators of the frequency of\nillegal abortions, i.e. hospital admissions for incomplete or septic\nabortions and deaths from other-than-legal abortions, have declined\nsignificantly in locations with non-restrictive abortion practices.\nThese data suggest that the number of illegal abortions has declined\nin recent years and that most women will choose a legal abortion over\nan illegal abortion when that choice is available. Tietze has\ncalculated that 70 percent of the legal abortions obtained in New\nYork City from July 1, 1970 to June 30, 1972 by resident women replaced\nillegal abortions which had previously taken place, and that the\nremainder was responsible for about one-half of the decline in live\nbirths that occurred between 1970 and 1972.26\/\nOther Demographic Effects of the Legalization of Abortion\nAlthough Tietze has argued that the predominant effect of the legaliza-\ntion of abortion has been a substitution of legal abortions for what other-\nwise would have been illegal abortions, he and other authors agree that\nthere has been a demographic effect as wel1, namely that there has been a more\nrapid decline in the birth rate in states with non-restrictive abortion\npractices than in other states, and particularly in the rates of out-of-\nwedlock births.27\/\n","39":"39\nPakter and Nelson have shown that the continued rise in the number of\nout-of-wedlock births in New York City during the 196(Ts (from 16,412 in\n1962 to 31,903 in 1970) was not reversed until 1971, the first full year of\nNew York's non-restrictive abortion law. In that year, out-of-wedlock births\ndeclined by 12 percent to 28,099^28\/ the first decrease since illegitimate\nbirths began to be recorded in 1954.J29_\/ The authors conclude that \"it was\nonly after abortions became available that the number of out-of-wedlock\nbirths began to diminish. Two-thirds of the terminations of pregnancy for\nNew York City residents were among the unmarried, and 90 percent of the\nteenagers undergoing abortions were unmarried.\"30\/\nSimilar data have been reported from California, where the out-of-\nwedlock fertility rate fell 16 percent, from 27 to 22.6 per 1,000 unmarried\nwomen between 1970 and 1971, the first year that non-restrictive abortion\npractices were widely adopted. Again, this was the first decline since 1966\nwhen records on legitimacy status began to be kept. Concomitant with this\ndecline was an increase in the teenage abortion rate from 30.8 per 1,000\nwomen aged 15-19 during July 1970-June 1971, to 41.2 per 1,000 in 1971-1972,\nan increase of 22.8 percent.3JV From a detailed analysis of the relation-\nship between legal abortion and out-of-wedlock births in California\nsince 1970, Sklar and Berkov have concluded that the availability of legal\nabortion was a significant factor in the decline in illegitimacy for\nCalifornia between 1970 and 1972.\u00e2\u0080\u00a232_\/\nA comparison of out-of-wedlock birthrates from 1965 to 1971 for the\nUnited States as a whole and for those states that had introduced less\nrestrictive abortion legislation suggests that abortion may have had an\nimmediate downward push on illegitimacy (Table 6). From 1965 to 1970,\nout-of-wedlock birthrates in all states had an annual average\nincrease of approximately three percent. After 1970, however, when a\ndozen states had adopted moderately restrictive or non-restrictive\nlegislation, out-of-wedlock birthrates declined 12 percent in states with\nliberalized abortion laws and only two percent in states with restrictive\nlaws.33\/\nAlthough these data can be interpreted as showing some relationship\nbetween the legalization of abortion and a decline in out-of-wedlock births\nin the subsequent year, no conclusions can be drawn with respect to the\nlong-term trend in out-of-wedlock births in an area with non-restrictive\nabortion legislation. In New York, the number of out-of-wedlock births\nreversed its two-year decline and increased in 1973 from 27,619 to\n28,292.\u00e2\u0080\u00a234\/ For the U.S. as a whole, the illegitimate birthrate increased\nin 1972 and then dropped slightly in 1973, but not to the low level\nachieved in 1971. Too many other factors affect the decision to bear a\nchild, and particularly an out-of-wedlock child, to allow conclusions\nabout the demographic effects of legal abortion.\n","40":"40\nTABLE 6\nEstimated Out-of-Wedlock Birthrates for Women Aged 15 to 44\nin States by Type of Abortion Legislation, United States, 1965-1973\nQut-of-Wedlock Births per 1.000 Unmarried Women Aged 15-44\nYear\n1965\n1966\n1967\n1968\n1969\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\nAll States\n22,\n22\n22,\n23.2\n24.\n25.\n24.\n24.9\n24.5\n,1\n,7\n,2\nStates with Moderate\nand Non-restrictive\nLegislation a\/\n23.\n23.\n24.4\n25.0\n25.9\n27,\n23.\nNA\nNA\n,5\n.7\n.1\n.7\nStates with Restrictive Legislation\n21.5\n21.4\n21.\n22.\n23,\n24.9\n24.5\nNA\nNA\n1965-1970 +3.0\n1970-1971 -5.8\n1971-1972 -1-2.9\n1972-1973 -1.7\nAverage Annual Percent Change\n+2.9\n-12.4\n+3.0\n-1.9\na\/ Includes the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado,\nDelaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,\nOregon, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington.\nSource: June Sklar and Beth Berkov. \"Teenage Family Formation in Postwar\nAmerica,\" Family Planning Perspectives 6: 86, Spring 1974; and\nU.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health\nService, National Center for Health Statistics.

After the Supreme Court decisions on\nabortion in January 1973, legal abortions began to be distributed more\nevenly throughout the students.\nDuring 1973, one-third of the women obtaining abortions were less\nthan 20 years of age, another third were between 20 and 25 years of age\nand the remaining third were over 25. Nearly 30 percent of the women\nwere married; the rest were single, divorced, separated, or widowed.\nAn examination by race shows that 73 percent of the women obtaining\nabortions were white and 27 percent were black or of other non-\nwhite origins, although in 1972 non-white women had legal abortion\nrates more than twice as great as those of white women.\nA national survey of abortion providers conducted by The Alan\nGuttmacher Institute in 1974 provides comprehensive data on the number of\nabortions performed in the U.S. during 1973 by State and type of provider.\nA total of 745,400 abortions were reported in the survey, 53 percent of\nthose in physicians' offices. Many public hospitals did not provide any\nabortion services even though many low-income women rely on these\ninstructions for most of their health care needs.\nA comparison of the 1972 and 1973 data on abortion supports the\nconclusion that nonrestrictive abortion practices lead to:\n1) an increase in the number of reported legal abortions;\n2) a decline in the number of women traveling outside their home\nstate to obtain an abortion; and\n3) a significantly greater use oflegal abortion by non-white women\nwithin their state of residence as compared to white women.\nAlthough there are no data on the trend in the number of illegal\nabortions, one study has shown that 70 percent of the abortions in New\nYork City during 1970-1971 and 1971-1972~the first two years of New York's\nnon-restrictive legislation\u00e2\u0080\u0094replaced illegal abortions which would have\nbeen performed illegally, and that the remaining 30 percent accounted for\n","43":"43\nabout one-half of the decline in births that occurred from 1970 to 1972,\nOne aspect of birthrate trends is the number of out-of-wedlock births.\nIn New York City and California legalization of abortion has been\nfollowed the next year by a decline in the number of these births,\nrepresenting a reversal of previous upward trends in the number of\nchildren born out-of-wedlock in these areas. Similarly, legalization\nof abortion has not been shown to result in a dramatic reduction in\ninfant mortality. However, no final conclusions on the causal relation-\nship between non-restrictive abortion legislation and the trend in\nout-of-wedlock births or infant mortality rates can be drawn at this\ntime.\n","44":"44\nREFERENCES\n1.
