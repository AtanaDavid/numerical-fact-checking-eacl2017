The version of Education in England: a brief history presented here was last revised and updated in 2010.
In November 2014 I started work on a major revision, which I hope to finish in late spring/early summer 2017.
Uploading individual chapters as I revise them would cause confusion both for me and for my readers, so the new version will not be available online until it is complete. However, several readers have asked if they could see the chapter on the coalition government, so I have uploaded the draft of this (chapter 13).
You can find out more about the new version here.
Education in England: a brief history explores the development of education in England from the earliest schools in the sixth century, through the establishment of the state education system in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to current concerns about government policies. It aims to explain how we got where we are now.
As its name indicates, it covers England rather than the whole of the UK, though I have included occasional references, where relevant, to educational policy and provision in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Similarly, while it deals mainly with education in schools, some information about higher education is given where it is relevant to the development of education generally.
In addition to the twelve chapters there's also a timeline of major education acts, reports and other key events; a glossary of commonly used abbreviations and terms which I hope will be especially useful for non-UK readers; and a bibliography (which is a compilation of all the quoted sources listed at the end of each chapter).
Each web page includes chapter links (as in the left hand column on this page) and at the end of each page there are links to the previous and next chapters. The left hand column also displays the organisation of each chapter with links to the main headings, as shown in the Contents list below.
Finally, if you spot any errors - anything from factual inaccuracies to missing punctuation or broken links - I'd be very grateful if you'd let me know. Contact details are here.
