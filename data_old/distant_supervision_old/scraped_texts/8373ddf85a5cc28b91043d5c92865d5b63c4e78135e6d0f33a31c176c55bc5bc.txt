The Greyhound Derby is the premier competition in the sport and attracts not only the leading four-bend performers from the United Kingdom, but also some of the elite Irish greyhounds and it is the highlight of the entire year, and at the moment takes place at Wimbledon stadium over 480m, and takes place in May and June.
It was first run at White City in 1927 and while it was run at Haringay in 1940, it was contested at White City over 500y, 525y and 500m up until 1984 when it finally left that stadium and moved to Plough Lane, Wimbledon in 1985, and since it's move to that venue it has continued to be the marquee event in the greyhound calendar, and down the years has been won by some of the finest greyhounds to ever grace the sport.
Mick The Miller was the first legendary greyhound to win the Greyhound Derby as he bagged victory in the event in 1929 and 1930, while Patricias Hope (1972 & 1973) was another dual winner of the event and is another standout name on what is a fantastically, illustrious roll of honour, and that list of winners hasÂ been enhanced by some more notable winners of the epic event.
Nick Savva's Westmead Hawk is one of the modern greats to have scorched the Wimbledon sand and the stunning greyhound powered to victory in the 2005 Greyhound Derby before retaining his crown a year later, while another huge name associated with this event is the great trainer Charlie Lister, who has trained multiple winners of the competition, with dual winner Rapid Ranger (2000 & 2001) and Taylors Sky (2011) just two of his star performers that have bounded to success in what is a great spectacle.
