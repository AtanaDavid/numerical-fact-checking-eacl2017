Last week we announced the winners of the Peugeot Boxer van and the runner’s up prize of £2000’s worth of Makita tools from our recent competition. The van is currently being prepared ready for us to hand over Wayne Dowell and we’ll catch up with him when he’s got the keys.
Our runner’s up prize, a variety of Makita tools provided by our Taunton Tools branch, has been handed over to Nik Read who was over the moon with his win. He said, “I couldn’t believe it when I first picked up the message saying I won. It wasn’t until we arranged for me to visit Bradfords’ Taunton Tools to choose the power tools that it sunk in.”

Nik (of Nik Read Plumbing and Heating) uses our Crewkerne branch to make most of his purchases and told us, “I’m very, very happy right now. These tools will be used every day and will go straight to work with me today.” We’re chuffed that Nik’s winnings will be put to such good use!
