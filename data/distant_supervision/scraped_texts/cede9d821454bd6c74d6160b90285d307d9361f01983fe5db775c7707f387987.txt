Line plot of global mean land-ocean temperature index, 1880 to present,
with the base period 1951-1980.
The dotted black line is the annual mean and the solid red line is the
five-year mean.  The green bars show uncertainty estimates.
[This is an update of Fig. 9a in
Hansen et al. (2010).]

Our traditional analysis using only meteorological station data is a line
plot of global annual-mean surface air temperature change, with the base period
1951-1980, derived from the meteorological station network
[This is an update of Plate 6(b) in
Hansen et al. (2001).] Uncertainty bars (95% confidence limits) are shown
for both the annual and five-year means, account only for incomplete
spatial sampling of data.

Annual and five-year running mean temperature changes, with the base period
1951-1980, for three latitude bands
that cover 30%, 40% and 30% of the global area. Uncertainty bars
(95% confidence limits) are based on spatial sampling analysis.

Annual and five-year running mean temperature changes with the base period
1951-1980 for the northern (red) and southern (blue) hemispheres.

Line plot of monthly mean global surface temperature anomaly,
with the base period 1951-1980.
The black line shows meterological stations only; red circles are the
land-ocean temperature index, as described in
Hansen et al. (2010).
The land-ocean temperature index uses sea surface temperatures
from ERSST v3b
Smith et al. (2008).

Annual and five-year running mean surface air temperature in
the contiguous 48 United States (1.6% of the Earth's surface)
relative to the 1951-1980 mean.
[This is an update of Plate 6(a) in  Hansen et al. (2001).
The corresponding graph in  Hansen et al. (1999)
shows a smaller trend, since it is based on data that were not yet corrected for station moves and time-of-observation changes, see FAQ.]
Temperature index change (with the base period 1951-1980) since 1950
at seasonal resolution, for the globe (upper line) and for low latitudes
(lower line). [This is an update of Figure 7 in
Hansen et al. (1999).]
Green triangles mark large volcanic eruptions.  SST at Nino 3.4 is the
12-month running mean.

The L-OTI data are available as
tabular data. The El Nino data were taken from this table provided by NOAA's NCEP. However, we are displaying the anomalies with respect to the 1951-1980 means.
