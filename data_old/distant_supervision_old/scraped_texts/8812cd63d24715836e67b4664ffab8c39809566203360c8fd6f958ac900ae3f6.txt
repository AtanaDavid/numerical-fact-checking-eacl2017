Stewart Cink today claimed his first major title as Tom Watson squandered the chance to create history in a dramatic Open Championship at Turnberry.
Watson just needed to par the final hole to claim his sixth Open title - a remarkable 34 years after his first - and become the oldest major winner by 11 years.
But the 59-year-old hit his approach through the green and then three-putted from the fringe, his putt for victory from eight feet never threatening the hole.
And Cink then won an anti-climactic four-hole play-off by six shots, playing the fifth, sixth, 17th and 18th in two under par as Watson stumbled to four over.
The American pair had finished tied on two under par, Cink making a birdie on the last for a round of 69 and Watson, who led by one at the start of the day, returning a 72.
England's Lee Westwood and Chris Wood missed out on the play-off by a single shot after both bogeyed the 72nd hole, Westwood three-putting from long range and Wood failing to get up and down from the back of the green.
Compatriot Ross Fisher led by two shots after birdies at the first two holes, but took eight at the fifth and eventually finished tied for 13th.
