Thank you for taking part in the Age UK Crystal Palace 10k on 22 March!
Around 1 million older people regularly go an entire month without speaking to anyone and 2.9 million older people feel they have no one to turn to for help and support. Funds raised will help Age UK to support lonely and vulnerable older people across the country and locally in the area.

We had a fantastic band travel all the way from America to support our runners!
