Presented by: Trailway Speedway
Harrisburg, PA - Farm Show Complex
February 18-20, 2011
Motorama is not just a single event, but offers
something for the entire family all under one
roof, which attracts over 40,000 spectators and
over 2,000 racers annually. The farm show complex
host a wide array of events and contest from the
arenacross, radio control racing, robot conflict,
car show, Go-Kart Racing, Quarter Midget Racing,
Hot Rod & Speed Car Show, Tunerwar, Spina-Bifida
Charity Auction, and Ms. Motorama Pageant.
As always, the Farm Show Arena was packed to
capacity with over 8,000 spectators and many standing
in the stairwells, trying to get a glimpse of
the ATV and motorcycle racing action with 27 Main
events on both Saturday and Sunday.
Wimmer may not have a full blown factory ride
for 2011, be he proved that he hasnâ€™t lost
any of this speed as he dominated the Arenacross
racing by claiming all four main event wins over
the weekend.
On Saturday, Wimmer grabbed the Holeshot in the
Open A class and checked out on the competition
as he lead from start to finish. In the Pro-Am
race, Wimmer once again got the jump off the line
and went on to claim yet another win.
