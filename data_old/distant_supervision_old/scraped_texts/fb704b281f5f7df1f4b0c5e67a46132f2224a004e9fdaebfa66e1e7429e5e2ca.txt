Gabriel Jesus made the right decision to join Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, according to Brazil coach Tite.
The 19-year-old signed a five-year deal with City in the summer but has remained with Brazilian league leaders Palmeiras until the end of the championship in December.
European rivals Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain were all reported to be interested in signing Jesus before he completed his Â£27 million move to the Etihad.
