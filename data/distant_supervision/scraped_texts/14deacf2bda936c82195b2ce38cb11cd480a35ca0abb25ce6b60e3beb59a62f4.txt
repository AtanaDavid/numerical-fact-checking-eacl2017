Bernadette, just ’cause your last name in Sanchez I have no reason to assume you are ‘Latino’, but nevertheless you do appear to be ignorant. I was born in Los Angeles, my grandparents on BOTH sides were born Mexican and all their families were born their or maybe in Spain as far back as we can remember.
The assertion you make that “…Hispanics lag behind in obtaining bachelor degrees because they have to take remedial courses…etc.” is plainly based (so it seems to me) on your ignorance of whom “Hispanics” really are. You may not be aware of the fact – for whatever reason – that a lot of “non-Hispanics” also never obtain the Holy Grail of a bachelor degree. I suppose you’d call them “under-achievers” or maybe just drop-outs.
Well, I “dropped out” of college after 3 1/2 years and went on to have my own business. My three other siblings actually got BA’s, and one of them went on to professorship at a university.
Too bad we never took those “remedial courses”. But then, we’re from California. Maybe you just know anything about Mexicans.
