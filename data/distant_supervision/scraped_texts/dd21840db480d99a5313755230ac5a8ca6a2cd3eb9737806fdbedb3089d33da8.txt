In "Phishing for Phools", George Akerlof and Robert Shiller suggest that:
...the harms of alcohol could be comparable to the harms of cigarettes, affecting not just 3 or 4 percent of the population, as a chronic life-downer, but, rather, affecting 15 to 30 percent; the higher number especially if we also include the alcoholics' most affected family members.
Akerlof and Shiller liken their position to "burping in public".Â In fact the only thing radical about their position is the way that they defend it.
