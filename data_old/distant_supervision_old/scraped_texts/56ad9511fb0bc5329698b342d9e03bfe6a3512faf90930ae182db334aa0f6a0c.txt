We are a friendly and sociable club with around 200 adult members  based in and around the   Crystal Palace area. We also have a very active and successful Junior section, with 75+ members.
There's something going on pretty much every day of the week, with three coached swim nights, two uncoached swim sesions at Crystal Palace, a Club run, regular Saturday morning sessions and a Club ride on   Sunday mornings. We also have member only sessions at HHV throughout the winter. You can decide how hard and how often you want to   train and all abilities are catered for. See the Training sessions pages for further details.
We have members of all standards. Most members participate in sprint and Olympic   distance races, with a growing number in middle distance and Ironman. We also   have age-groupers who take part in the major races, both in the UK and abroad,   including the National Championships. So don't be put off if   you're not very good at one of the sports, you'll get lots of encouragement from   existing members and don't forget it's never too late to learn!
Our Club Championships are held at sprint,   standard, middle and long distance, in 2016 Jetstream Open Water Sprint, Thorpe Park Standard,   Midnight Man Middle Distance and any long distance/Ironman race. The duathlon Club Championship will   be held at the Dragon Slayer Duathlon. We also have an Aquathlon championship   race, Windrush Aquathlon, an Aquabike championship race, Mid Sussex Aquabike, and a Club league, with age-group categories, to give all members a chance of glory.
Details about joining the club can be found on the Membership page.
We take training seriously but enjoy it at the same time and hold a number of social activities throughout the year.
CPT organises the annual Crystal Palace   Triathlon at the National Sports Centre. The 2017 race will be held on Sunday 14 May.
