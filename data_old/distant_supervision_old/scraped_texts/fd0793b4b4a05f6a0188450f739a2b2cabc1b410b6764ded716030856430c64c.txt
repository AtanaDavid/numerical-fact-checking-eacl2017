The year-long Raleigh Orthodontics Car Magnet Contest officially came to a close on September 30th. Out of the hundreds of entries we had, 12 lucky finalists were chosen to be part of the final drawing in early October.
Congratulations to the Hudnall Family of Oxford!
Looks like the Hudnall Family had a BLAST at Great Wolf Lodge Courtesy of Raleigh Orthodontics! Stay tuned for our next contest announcement coming soon!
As you all know, our 35th year in practice was 2014, and to celebrate, we ran an online Raleigh Orthodontics cruise giveaway contest for a year! We had over 20,000 entries into our cruise contest over that year! From those over 20,000 entries we had an outside company narrow it down to 5 finalists! On Friday, May 29th at 5:30 pm we had our official cruise contest spin-off party in our Raleigh office! We had a fabulous cruise themed cake made by our own Danielle, and a huge spinning wheel where the finalists and their families “spun” for a chance to be the cruise winner!
The cruise finalists spun the Raleigh Orthodontics wheel and earned points in each of the 4 “rounds” where the family with the lowest score was dropped from the competition and given a consolation prize of a $150 gift certificate to the Angus Barn in Raleigh! The final round included the Davis Family of Raleigh and the Arnott Family of Oxford. Both families spun the wheel 3 final times to see who could claim the coveted cruise winner title. With the highest score in the final round the Davis Family of Raleigh are the winners of the Caribbean Cruise! Congratulations to them and we cannot wait to hear all about your fabulous vacation courtesy of Raleigh Orthodontics!
