A valid undamaged vignette affixed on an untinted area of the windscreen interior is the only acceptable substantiation that the toll has been duly paid.
A cash fine of up to € 240 is levied if a vignette is not affixed. If the fine is not paid immediately on the spot, administrative penal proceedings will be initiated and which involve considerably higher costs (€ 300 - € 3.000).
