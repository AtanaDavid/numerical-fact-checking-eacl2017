Soccer will be coming to the Sears Centre Arena in Hoffman Estates by the end of this year.
The village board approved a final agreement Monday allowing the Chicago Kick, a new professional indoor soccer team, to play 13 home games at the arena during the 2012-13 season.
Ben Gibbs, general manager for the Sears Centre, said he traveled with the team's CEO, Armando Gamboa, to the headquarters of the United Soccer Leagues in Tampa, Fla., last week to further discuss plans for the team.
The Chicago Kick will be part of the Major Indoor Soccer League, which is governed by the United Soccer Leagues.
"Based on those conversations, and some ongoing conversations with the original ownership group, we made some alterations to the contract that is more efficient for the team and doesn't change our revenue potential for next year," Gibbs said. "It was a win-win proposition."
The team will be submitting a cash deposit of $35,000, which is $10,000 more than originally planned. A $25,000 letter of credit has been eliminated in the plans.
Rent rates have also been changed. Originally, rent was going to be linked to attendance and range from $8,000 to $10,000 per game. It will now be a flat $7.500 per game and parking will be included with the tickets, which will be general admission -- eliminating the need for parking lot personnel and reducing the number of ushers needed.
Gibbs called the ownership group "very localized" because their businesses or homes are located in Hoffman Estates. Gamboa, for example, is also the owner of Grand Sports Arena at 2350 Hassell Road.
"We have not had an ownership group that's based here, in the village, for quite some time, so I think it is a nice change," Gibbs said.
Members of the board expressed excitement over the final agreement and wished the team good luck.
The Chicago Kick's season will run from November through March.
