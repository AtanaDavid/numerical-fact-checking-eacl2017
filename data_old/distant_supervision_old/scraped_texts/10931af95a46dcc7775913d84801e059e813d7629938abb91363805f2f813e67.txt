Lou Graham, an American professional golfer, was born on January 7, 1938. He started playing golf at the early age of seven years old. His amateur career took off when he went to college where he attended Memphis State University. It was in this university where Graham joined the school golf team ad played for three years. Later on his life, Graham was drafted into the US Army. His career in golf continued even while he was serving the army. He was a member of the Old Guard – Company E of the Third US Infantry Regiment, where he served as a ceremonial Honor Guard whose duty was to guard the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. While in the Army, Graham joined the Army golf team and managed to win the Inter-Service championship in the year 1961.
In the year 1964, Graham turned pro and joined the PGA Tour in September of that year. His first win came three years later in 1967 at the Minnesota Golf Classic held at the Hazeltine National Golf Club. His two other wins came in 1972 at the Ligget Myers Open. Graham won again in 1975 in the US Open. Winning three titles in fifteen years of professional golf wasn’t quite impressive. However, when Graham came back to the scene in 1979, he won three titles in a space of eleven weeks. For this, Graham was awarded the Golf Digest’s Comeback Player of the Year Award.
Other achievements accomplished by Lou Graham include playing on the Ryder Cup team for three years (1973, 1975, and 1977), winning over $1.4 million on the PGA Tour and over $600,000 in the Senior Tour, being victorious in the 1975 World Cup Team and being inducted as a charter member of the Tennessee Golf Hall of Fame in 1992.
