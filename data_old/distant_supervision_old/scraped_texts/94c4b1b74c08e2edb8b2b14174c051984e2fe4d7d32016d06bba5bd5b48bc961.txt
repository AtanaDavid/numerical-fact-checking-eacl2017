Before his terrific victory at the British Open in 1988, “Golf World” published an article about Seve Ballesteros and how he had played the last six holes in Royal Lytham St. Anne in 1979 at his first Open victory. There was the conventional route and "the Seve way", a definition of his specific personal style. The way he played the 16th hole was unforgettable, using a driver instead of a conventional iron on the shortest possible path. The ball landed in the parking lot from where Seve placed it on the green with such skill that he shot a birdie.
Emotions and a brilliant, short game were his best allies on the golf course. His magical shots were the result of years of practice. He started as a boy on the beaches of Pedreña, where he hit stones with a home-made 3 iron. In his best days there was no one better at achieving low stroke counts in play. This is how he won the Harry Vardon Trophy six times for the lowest average score on the European PGA Tour.
Perhaps the greatest legacy of Seve Ballesteros is that he elevated European golf to the world stage, leaving his mark on the European Ryder Cup team, encouraging the players and making the team competitive. Together with Seve, the Europeans won the Cup for the first time on American soil in 1987. Seve’s intrepidness and will to compete made him one of the greatest match play golfers of all times.
