Jamal Campbell-Ryce’s 82nd-minute strike sealed Sheffield United’s passage to the next round of the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy, with a 2-1 win at Hartlepool United.
Campbell-Ryce shot through bodies to put United ahead for the second time, after Michael Duckworth had dragged Hartlepool back on level terms.
Earlier, Jose Baxter had marked his return to the United starting eleven with the opening goal.
Baxter, making his return after a hamstring injury, curled home the opener in the 31st minute, via the post.
Baxter, who was recalled for United alongside Chris Porter, was taken off at half time and replaced by Marc McNulty.
And the home side clawed themselves back on level terms in the 49th minute, thanks to Duckworth’s deflected effort.
The Blades then had a goal disallowed for a foul on home goalkeeper Scott Flinders, after referee Carl Boyeson ruled there had been an infringement by Porter.
Italian youth international Diego De Girolamo was handed a rare chance to impress United boss Nigel Clough, who made the unusual decision to name his starting line-up on the eve of tonight’s clash and also handed Iain Turner, Louis Reed and Stephen McGinn recalls.
Campbell-Ryce, who made his return from injury during Saturday’s defeat at Chesterfield, also started while Michael Woods and Tommy Miller featured for managerless Hartlepool.
