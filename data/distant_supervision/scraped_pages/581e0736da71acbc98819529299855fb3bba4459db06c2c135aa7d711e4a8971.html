<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 8th, 2016</strong> by South Front</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>On September 5, the Fatah Halab militant group that is a part of the Al Nusra Front-led operation room called “Jaish al-Fatah” announced an advance on the Al-Amiriyah Neighborhood of Aleppo City. By September 6, the militants claim to have already captured about 80% of the neighborhood. Pro-militant sources also claimed that Jaish al-Fatah resized the town of Qarassi. This cannot be confirmed. The Syrian government forces and the terrorist alliance control some parts of the town.</em></p>
<p>The Russian Aerospace Forces have been pounding the Aleppo-Idlib countryside, destroying terrorist targets along the Aleppo-Damascus Highway. Air strikes were reported at Khan Tuman, Saraqib, Hikma School, Qarassi in the Aleppo neighborhoods of Ramouseh and Al-Amiriyah and in the areas south of the Ramouseh Artillery Base. The goal of the air strikes is to allow the Syrian army, Hezbollah and other pro-government units to consolidate the recent gains and contribute to further operations to set control of the Ramouseh Industrial District.</p>
<p>If the pro-government forces are able to secure Ramouseh and Al-Amiriyah neighborhoods, they will be able to reopen the southern supply line to western Aleppo.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UsH6p9BBpoI" frameborder="0" width="690" height="400"></iframe></p>
<p>In the province of Homs, the Syrian army and the National Defense Forces have recaptured the Tal Sawwan hill, the village of Huwaysis and the Al-Mahr Gas Fields that they had lost to the ISIS terrorist group earlier. This allowed the pro-government forces to stabilize front-line in the area amid heavy clashes at other frontlines.</p>
<p>Russia and the United States may reach an agreement on resolving the Syrian crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on September 5. The statement was made following a meeting with US President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>According to Putin, the two leaders have come to a common understanding. Putin said that he had “grounds to believe” that the first results may be achieved “within the next few days.”</p>
<p>Obama described his meeting with Putin as “candid” and “blunt” focusing mainly on Syria and Ukraine. He noted that an agreement with Russia on ending the violence in Syria is being hampered by “gaps of trust” between the two governments. Obama called the discussion on Syria “productive” but noted that the gaps have not been closed in negotiations between Russia and the US in a way that they think would “actually work.” In other words the sides will continue negotiations till they are able to reach a consensus or the situation on the ground in Syria will give an upper hand to one of the sides.</p>

<p>Murray was forced out of the British public service after he exposed the use of torture by Britain&#8217;s Uzbek allies.

<p>In 2006 Murray was himself awarded the Sam Adams Award, and the citation included the following: &#8220;Mr. Murray learned that the intelligence authorities of the UK and the US were receiving and using information extracted by the most sadistic methods of torture by Uzbek authorities. He protested strongly to London, to no avail. He was forced out of the British Foreign Office, but has no regrets. There are more important things than career…Mr. Murray&#8217;s light has pierced a thick cloud of denial and deception. He has set a courageous example for those officials of the &#8216;Coalition of the Willing&#8217; who have first-hand knowledge of the inhuman practices involved in the so-called &#8216;war on terror&#8217; but who have not yet been able to find their voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shocked by the denial of approval to enter the United States without a visa, Murray stated: &#8220;I shall apply for a visa via the State Department as suggested but I must be on a list to be refused under the ESTA system, and in any event it is most unlikely to be completed before the conference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth noting,&#8221; Murray added,&#8221; that despite the highly critical things I have published about Putin, about civil liberties in Russia and the annexation of the Crimea, I have never been refused entry to Russia. The only two countries that have ever refused me entry clearance are Uzbekistan and the USA. What does that tell you?</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no criminal record, no connection to drugs or terrorism, have a return ticket, hotel booking and sufficient funds. I have a passport from a visa waiver country and have visited the USA frequently before during 38 years and never overstayed. The only possible grounds for this refusal of entry clearance are things I have written against neo-liberalism, attacks on civil liberties and neo-conservative foreign policy. People at the conference in Washington will now not be able to hear me speak. Plainly ideas can be dangerous. So much for the land of the free!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The following joint statement has been signed by members of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence listed below:</strong></p>
<p><em>News that former British Ambassador Craig Murray has been denied entry to the United States under the regular visa waiver program is both shocking and appalling. We Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) had invited Craig to be Master of Ceremonies at our award ceremony honoring John Kiriakou, the CIA torture whistleblower (more details at <a href="http://samadamsaward.ch/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://samadamsaward.ch&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1473333404998000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeETilSQeQFL9hwcVBf5qzyE72Vw">samadamsaward.ch</a> ), this September as part of the &#8216;No War 2016&#8242; conference. </em></p>
<p><em>Now we&#8217;re wondering which agency&#8217;s long arms have reached out to disrupt our ceremony and to try to silence Craig. </em></p>
<p><em>Whatever they intend, it will be bound to backfire, since it only makes the US government look like some sort of monolithic repressive apparatus out to mimic the world&#8217;s worst despotic regimes. Ambassador Murray notes in his blog that Uzbekistan &#8212; whose government apparatchiks are notorious for torturing its citizens &#8212; is the only other country to have barred his entry. Even Russia &#8211; which Ambassador Murray criticizes freely &#8211; allows him to travel there trouble-free. What are the implications for US democratic values?</em></p>
<p><em>We strongly urge the State Department to reverse its decision and allow Ambassador Murray freedom of travel and freedom of expression without hindrance in the United States of America.</em></p>

<p>David Swanson, Director of World Beyond War, said &#8220;This attempt to prevent a truth-teller from speaking in support of nonviolence is absolutely shameful. This is not a policy created to represent any view of the U.S. public, and we are not going to stand for it.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Hillary is so irreparably tainted and unfit to serve, her key strategy is diverting attention from her wrongdoing two ways &#8211; bashing Trump beyond customary campaign jousting and spreading misinformation and Big Lies about Russia, using the media as press agents to do her dirty work.</em></p>
<p>Neocon Washington Post editors and staff one-sidedly support her, one of many examples of how low US media scoundrels have sunk &#8211; transforming themselves into disgraceful laughing stocks.</p>
<p>The way to stay misinformed and brainwashed is by following their reports. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/intelligence-community-investigating-covert-russian-influence-operations-in-the-united-states/2016/09/04/aec27fa0-7156-11e6-8533-6b0b0ded0253_story.html">WaPo’s latest anti-Russia harangue</a> is claiming a potential covert plot to disrupt November elections.</p>
<p>Guilt by accusation suffices, no verifiable evidence needed, WaPo saying “US intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in US political institutions, (unnamed) intelligence and congressional officials said.”</p>
<p>When sources remain unnamed, speaking on condition of anonymity, automatic red flags are raised &#8211; especially when Russia is irresponsibly bashed, practically a daily affair by media scoundrels and rogue government officials.</p>
<p>Nothing suggest Russia or its predecessor the Soviet Union ever attempted to interfere with America’s political process &#8211; nor does evidence exist indicating it’s now happening.</p>
<p>One unnamed US source admitted America’s intelligence community has no “definitive proof” or anything suggesting a Russian plot to manipulate or otherwise disrupt the nation’s electoral process.</p>
<p>So why is WaPo reporting rubbish, vicious Russia-bashing propaganda, while ignoring how America interferes in numerous elections abroad to assure officials in charge serve its interests?</p>
<p>Press agent journalism operates this way, Hillary picking up on WaPo’s report, claiming nonexistent Russian interference in America’s electoral process is “a threat from an adversarial foreign power.”</p>
<p>She outrageously accused Trump of encouraging Moscow to spy on her, saying “(w)e’ve never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process, (and) we’ve never had a nominee of one of our major parties urging the Russians to hack more.”</p>
<p>Irresponsibly bashing Russia and Trump diverts attention from her own high crimes, a deplorable record at least since the 1990s. Media scoundrels serve her interests, going all-out to assure she succeeds Obama &#8211; humanity’s fate hanging in the balance if successful.</p>
<p>Russia bashing is part of longterm strategy heading inevitably toward East/West confrontation &#8211; the unthinkable possibility of nuclear war.</p>
<p>Bipartisan neocon lunatics infesting Washington could attack anytime at their discretion, inventing a pretext for global war &#8211; the greatest risk with Hillary in power, why stopping her is urgent.</p>
<p>According to WaPo, administration officials are “weighing their response” to baseless anti-Russian allegations.</p>
<p>Are they preparing for war once Hillary in all likelihood assumes power next year? Humanity’s survival is more at risk than ever with her finger on the nuclear trigger.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 8th, 2016</strong> by Peter Symonds</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>Barack Obama arrived Monday night in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, becoming the first US president to return to the scene of one of US imperialism’s bloodiest crimes, even as his administration is preparing new wars on a far greater scale.</em></p>
<p>Obama will attend the East Asian Summit where rising tensions with China over the South China Sea are set to dominate following a ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in favour of a US-backed Philippine challenge to China’s territorial claims.</p>
<p>In a pre-recorded CNN interview aired on Sunday, Obama signalled his intent to deliver a blunt message to Chinese President Xi Jinping to abide by the court’s decision. “When we see them violating international rules and norms, as we have seen in some cases in the South China Sea, or in some of their behaviour when it comes to economic policy, we’ve been very firm,” he said, warning: “We’ve indicated to them that there will be consequences.”</p>
<p>What utter hypocrisy! As with every other international rule and norm, the US insists that others abide by rulings under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which it has not even ratified. Over the course of his two terms in office, Obama has transformed the long-running regional disputes in the South China Sea into a dangerous international flashpoint that threatens to trigger war.</p>
<p>Obama routinely declares that China must abide by the “international rules-based order”—that is, the post-World War II order that enshrined American global hegemony and empowered Washington to write the rules for others. He also boasts that it was US military might in the Asia Pacific that ensured “peace” and underwrote the region’s massive economic expansion over the past 40 years.</p>
<p>American dominance in Asia, however, was only established through a series of criminal neo-colonial wars—in particular in Korea and Indochina—that cost the lives of millions, as well as countless diplomatic intrigues and CIA-backed coups. The bloodiest coup, in Indonesia in 1965-66, involved the slaughter of at least a half million workers, peasants and members of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).</p>
<p>The CIA’s secret war in Laos ranks among American imperialism’s worst war crimes. Between 1964 and 1973, the US conducted 580,000 missions and dropped more than two million bombs on a country less than the size of New Zealand. That is equivalent to one planeload of bombs every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, or roughly one tonne of explosives for every man, woman and child in Laos at the time. Laos remains the most heavily bombed country per capita in history.</p>
<p>The US took over from the French in attempting to suppress the anti-colonial movement throughout Indochina—Vietnam and Cambodia as well as Laos—that was dominated by Stalinist parties and backed by the Soviet Union and China. The CIA used every dirty trick in the book to prop up the Royal Lao Government and disrupt North Vietnamese soldiers and supplies from passing down the so-called Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam.</p>
<p>The CIA was centrally involved, as the war did not have congressional approval and was kept under a cloak of secrecy by the American political and media establishment. As the Royal Laotian army crumbled, CIA operatives recruited, armed and trained an anti-communist guerrilla force estimated at 30,000 from among hill tribes, largely the Hmong. These were bolstered by a secret army of mercenaries from Thailand and US-trained soldiers from South Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Some 350,000 men, women and children were killed in the carnage, and a tenth of the country’s population was displaced by the fighting. The CIA’s Hmong allies lost so many fighters that they turned to the forcible recruitment of child soldiers as young as eight. To fund the war, the Hmong, assisted by the CIA, grew and sold opium, helping to fuel a global heroin epidemic. The CIA company, Air America, flew the drugs out of land-locked Laos.</p>
<p>The secret war devastated the country. According to one account, “Village after village was levelled, countless people burned alive by high explosives, or by napalm and white phosphorus, or riddled by anti-personnel bomb pellets.” Vast quantities of unexploded ordnance cover nearly a third of the country and have killed or maimed at least 20,000 people since the end of the war. More than 12,000 survivors are in need of ongoing medical care and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>A pittance in US aid—just $118 million—has been provided to deal with unexploded bombs. An estimated 1 percent of contaminated land has been cleared. The Obama administration has increased the amount from $5 million in 2010 to $19.5 million this year, not out of any concern for the Laotian people, but rather as part of its efforts to bully and bribe the Vientiane regime to loosen its ties with Beijing and reorient towards Washington.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War has not led to peace but to an escalating succession of wars over the past 25 years, as American capitalism has sought to offset its decline through military might. As was the case in Laos and more broadly Indochina and Korea, whole countries—Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya—have been devastated in an effort to shore up American global hegemony.</p>
<p>As the global economic breakdown worsens, the United States is actively and aggressively preparing for war against major powers—above all, China and Russia. Washington’s diplomatic efforts in Vientiane are part of Obama’s far broader “pivot to Asia” over the past five years aimed at undermining, weakening and militarily encircling China. As a result, the South China Sea is just one of the flashpoints in Asia that Obama has deliberately inflamed and that could set off a conflict between the two nuclear-armed powers.</p>
<p>Only the working class can halt the slide into another catastrophic world war. This underscores the necessity of the political fight being waged by the International Committee of the Fourth International to build an international anti-war movement uniting workers in the US, China, throughout Asia and the world to put an end to capitalism and to reconstruct society on socialist foundations.</p>

<p><em>Much of the power of the <strong>New York Times</strong> derives from its ability to declare what the serious center is and who is relegated to the dismissible margins. You can see that power being exercised in a recent <strong>Times </strong>report (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-britain.html">9/4/16</a>) on British politics by <a href="http://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/nyt-misleads-readers-on-iran-crisis/">Steven Erlanger</a>.</em></p>
<p>The story focused on Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn—or “its left-wing leader, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/world/europe/labour-jeremy-corbyn.html">Jeremy Corbyn</a>,” in the <strong>Times</strong>‘ formulation. The point of the piece is to blame Corbyn for the fact that “the Labour Party is in shambles: Its leader and its members of Parliament are in a virtual civil war, and it is deeply unpopular with the broader electorate.”</p>
<p>Labour’s unpopularity is easy to exaggerate;  its <a href="https://electionsetc.com/2016/05/06/bbc-projected-national-share-pns-of-the-vote-2016/">projected national share</a> of the vote in the last local elections, held in May 2016, was 31 percent, a percentage point ahead of the Conservatives; this is <a href="http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-impact/what-do-the-2016-local-elections-tell-us-about-what-might-happen-in-2020/#_ftn1">considered unpromising</a>, as opposition parties that are soon to become governing parties generally do better than that, but it’s an improvement over May 2015 (four months before Corbyn assumed leadership), when Labour trailed by <a href="https://electionsetc.com/2016/05/04/calculating-the-local-elections-projected-national-share-pns-in-2015-and-2016/">6 percentage points</a>.</p>
<p>Corbyn’s responsibility for Labour’s woes, however, is taken for granted by the <strong>Times</strong>—because he’s just too far left:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Corbyn, a man of the hard left who also wants to renationalize the utilities and make Britain non-nuclear, is deeply skeptical of the United States and considers NATO an outdated, aggressive alliance…. First elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr. Corbyn had always been on Labour’s fringe. He supported Hugo Chávez, the leftist Venezuelan strongman; has pushed hard for more spending for the poor; and has been a persistent critic of Israel and supporter of Palestinian statehood.</p></blockquote>
<p>The thing is, some of these “hard left” positions are widely popular in the United Kingdom. A 2013 YouGov poll  (<a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/">11/4/13</a>), for example, found 68 percent of UK voters in favor of nationalizing energy companies, and 66 percent supporting railroad nationalization. When recognition of Palestinian statehood was considered by the UN in 2011, a <strong>BBC</strong> poll (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14946179">9/19/11</a>) found 53 percent of Britons in favor, only 26 percent opposed.</p>
<p>As for pushing for more spending on the poor, given a choice between “Labour should offer more for people in poverty” and “Labour should offer more for people on middle incomes” in a poll sponsored by the Trades Union Congress (<a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/economic-issues/social-issues/new-poll-has-no-easy-answers-labour-trust-and-competence-key">5/20/15</a>), 44 percent of UK citizens picked the former, vs. 29 choosing the latter.</p>
<p>The British public is more mixed on the UK’s nuclear force, with 51 percent expressing support for the nation’s submarine warheads in an ORB poll and 49 percent advocating scrapping them (<strong>Independent</strong>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/trident-majority-of-britons-back-keeping-nuclear-weapons-programme-poll-shows-a6831376.html">1/24/16</a>). I couldn’t find any polling on how the British public felt about Corbyn’s attitude toward Hugo Chávez, perhaps because no one thought that this issue was a particularly vital one for the UK electorate.</p>
<p>It’s probably true that Corbyn is more skeptical of the <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/">United States</a> and <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/02/british-public-back-nato-pact-waver-defence-some-a/">NATO</a>than the average Brit. But it’s hard not to get the impression that certain positions are identified by Erlanger as problematic not because they’re unpopular with Corbyn’s constituents—but because they’re unpopular with the <strong>New York Times</strong>.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 8th, 2016</strong> by Jim Miles</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>If the reader is looking for the ‘indispensable’ nation and its ‘exceptionalism’, this is the book for you.  Michael Mandelbaum, whose credentials include a PhD in Political Science from Harvard (which speaks volumes about initial bias in itself) and writes in association with another true believer &#8211; Thomas Friedman of the New York Times &#8211; wrote Mission Failure as an acknowledgement that U.S. foreign policy has failed in some areas, but not because it was their fault.  The ‘fault’ lines I have to qualify, as he does accept blame for NATO&#8217;s expansion eastward as a mistake, but counters as if it is the dictatorship and aggressiveness of Russia that truly mattered.</em></p>
<p>It is, essentially, the mainstream media message concerning the United States and current events mainly from the Clinton era through to the Russian “invasion” of Ukraine.  The arguments presented have many faults that anyone reading alternate materials &#8211; rather than those derived from CNN, FOX, or any other U.S. corporate based media production &#8211; could recognize.</p>
<p>The big one, the mind numbing one, the oftly reiterated one (as if the Big Lie, when told often enough, becomes the truth) is that U.S. intentions are always good, and that all that was intended was to establish democracy and freedom throughout the world.  Fine and noble sentiments but essentially all rhetoric and hubris covering over the quest for global hegemony for other ignored reasons.</p>
<p>The work starts with China and Russia, then transfers over to the Middle East, then returns to China and Russia at the end.  The mission in China was human rights, followed by capitalism leading towards democracy (always the conflation of the decidedly non-democratic structures of capitalism with the the promotion of democracy &#8211; probably taught at Harvard poli-sci).  In China the policy failed “Because the United States did not have the power to enforce it.”  Well of course, China has nuclear weapons and would use them to defend itself &#8211; as well as owning a large segment of U.S. debt and harboring many U.S. corporate endeavours.</p>
<p>With Russia the writing concerns its opening up under Yeltsin and then its aggressive, hostile and non-democratic stance under the evil Putin.   In reference to NATO, Mandelbaum establishes his only realistic acceptance of U.S. screwups.   “Russia accepted NATO expansion because it had no choice [short of nuclear war],” and “for no gain at all”  the “NATO expansion [was] one of the greatest blunders in the history of American foreign policy.”</p>
<p>After reading the first parts of the book I had almost given up and decided it was not worth reading, but after this statement I continued on.  There was no redemption. The writing continued in its very narrow sighted scope of interpretation (very similar in style to Friedman’s) with the fault for the problems always being the other guy.</p>
<p>It is not worth referencing many of the canards, dissimulations, conflations, and outright lies that abound in the book.  What is noteworthy, as usual, is what is not presented.</p>
<p><strong>“Western interests”</strong></p>
<p>Mandelbaum does discuss briefly the Washington consensus institutions such as the IMF, WTO, World Bank, et al, but never digs deep enough to consider that they are an essential part of the U.S.  corporate/military drive towards global hegemony (recall Friedman’s “hidden glove” of the military protecting U.S.interest abroad &#8211; at least he had that part right).  That need/desire for power comes from these institutions doing their best to protect the sanctity of the US$ as the global fiat reserve currency.  There is no discussion of this and its relationship with the Saudis and that the global trade in oil &#8211; re the petrodollar &#8211; is done via the US$.</p>
<p>Nor is there any mention of the ideas presented in John Perkins “<em>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</em>”(Berrett-Koehler Publishers (Nov. 9 2004))  concerning how these institutions attempted and mostly succeeded into bringing many countries into the world of debt (and thus control) being owed to the central monetary powers of the west (and such “western interests” as frequently stated by Mandelbaum without truly being defined).  Another good read along this line should be Michael Hudson’s “<em>Killing the Host</em>” (CounterPunch (August 26, 2015)) that outlines how the current financial structures supercede sovereignty and control the countries of the world through debt obligations. Naomi Klein’s “The Shock Doctrine” (Vintage/Random House, 2007) examines the highly predatory negative impacts of corporate/financial doctrines around the world.</p>
<p>In other words, “western interests” are very poorly aligned with freedom and democracy and much more in tune with corporate/military/political hegemony for the ruling small percentage of those in power generally behind the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Tribalism et al</strong></p>
<p>Mandelbaum’s writing concerning the greater Middle East takes a different angle.  For this large area the main problem is the backwardness, the clannish nature, the religious differences, and the tribalism that permeates the region.   I will always find it ironic that many western writers deride Arab tribalism when Michael Oren, former ambassador to the U.S., takes pride in his Jewish  “tribe.”</p>
<p>This of course makes the Arabs unsuitable for the noble quest of national reform towards democracy and free markets.  What is not discussed is, partly as above, the quest for global $ hegemony based on the petrodollar.</p>
<p>But here it spreads out into a denial of anything critical of Israel.  Perhaps Mandelbaum does not wish to lose his tenure or withstand any criticism about what could be criticized about Israel, but he accepts wholeheartedly the mainstream Israeli narrative about the country being the only democracy in the Middle East.   There is little discussion of the historical setting for Israel and what is presented is a conflation implying causation (e.g. the UN Partition Plan idea, being followed by a statement about Israel fighting for independence as if the former was a legal basis for the latter &#8211; which it isn’t).</p>
<p>As always in similar indispensable/exceptional discourses, Israel is a democracy and a “shining light” for the region.   The history of settler-colonialism is not discussed, nor its ongoing patterns of settlement and repression within the remnant Palestinian territories.  And as always Hamas is the super bad guy that won the election but then attacked Fatah to retain the Gaza strip as their domain.  More lies, more dissimulation of Israeli and US activities.</p>
<p>Also within this context, the main discussion for Mandelbaum focusses on the so called “peace process” as a US foreign policy failure, but again only because the Arabs were a recalcitrant, reluctant, tribal bunch of ignorant people not ready for democracy and freedom.  What is missing  of course is the whole history of colonial conquests from the Ottomans through to the European divisions of the area into areas of interest and influence, setting the stage for many of today’s problems in the region.</p>
<p>A wide set of readings that discusses the true situation in the Middle East should include anything by Ilan Pappe, Neve Gordon, Jonathan Cook, Robert Fisk, Miko Peled, Tanya Rinehart, Noam Chomsky among many others.</p>
<p><strong>Covert operations</strong></p>
<p>Another large miss in this work is the lack of any look at U.S. covert operations, either through the CIA/NSA networks or through various NGO networks of the kind funded by George Soros.  These covert actions are global and range from military actions to staged protests and economic influence peddling.  Further reading in this area should include Brzezinski’s “<em>The Grand Chessboard</em>” ( Basic Books; 1St Edition (September 18, 1998)) outlining a plan for global domination by the U.S.   More reading should include something from the Project for a New American Century, “<em>Rebuilding America’s Defences</em>,”  written by a variety of neocons/pro-Israeli chicken hawks that included expectations of a “new Pearl Harbor”.</p>
<p>There are many other authors that discuss and highlight U.S. intentions for ‘full spectrum dominance’ within a new “pax Americana,” Andrew J. Bacevich being one of the more authoritative, with several books on the “American empire” in print.</p>
<p>The “new Pearl Harbor” did happen after all, 9/11.  Mandelbaum accepts the official version of the story wherein a bunch of tribal misfits managed to defeat all security measures surrounding the Pentagon, and all flight security measures in order to fly planes into two World Trade Center towers.  Mandelbaum, as with many others, writes about two towers “falling”, but says nothing of the third tower that ‘fell’ that day, nor anything about the evacuation of the Saudis on the first no-fly day.  Interesting how those tribal Saudi’s seem capable of avoiding U.S. scrutiny ever since Roosevelt visited King Abdul Aziz on the U.S. cruiser USS Quincy in 1945.</p>
<p><strong>All of the above -</strong></p>
<p>When examining U.S. global enterprises, all of the above considerations need and must to come into consideration.  Global currency/economic policies, military overt and covert operations, political determinations of global dominance, the historical context of empirical projects, sequestering of resources, the power of the elites:  all need to be considered as warp and woof of the same fabric &#8211; U.S. global domination and supremacy.</p>
<p>Democracy and freedom make wonderful domestic fodder, and are good mainstream media  fodder for foreign governments fallen into a state of sycophancy towards the U.S. (the “western interests”).  The reality behind U.S. failures stems not from a rejection of these ideas in particular, but in a rejection of the U.S. as a global militarized hegemon.  Democracy and freedom cannot arrive from the barrel of a gun, nor from the pork-barrel of the Washington consensus.</p>
<p>Mandelbaum’s<em> Mission Failure</em> is a failed mission.  To those only familiar with mainstream news, and/or those who are looking for quotable quotes to misrepresent their preconceived notions of U.S. supremacy, this would be a good read.  If after this you decide to read it, then try also the other authors indicated (and there are many more) for &#8211; not a “balanced” picture, as that is a mainstream meme &#8211; for a critical, analytical, and much more accurate view of the imperial hegemon.</p>

The terrorists are sent by your goverment. They are al Qaeda Jabhat al Nusra Wahhabi Salafists Talibans etc and the like extremists jihadists sent by the West and the Saudis and Qatar and Turkey. Your Obama and whoever is behind him or above him are supporting al Qaeda and leading a proxy war on my country. We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them.</p>

<p>The German Minister of Economy and Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Sigmar Gabriel, a few days ago has declared that the European Union should not submit to the demands of the United States, referring to the negotiations on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investments Partnership). He said the negotiations failed. By saying so, he joined French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, as well as French Secretary of State for External Trade, Mr. Matthias Fekl.</p>

<p>WTC Building exploding into fine dust (it is not burning down) by pre-planted explosives in an obvious controlled demolition. The arrow points to a “squib” of exploding gas which is commonly seen with controlled demolitions. Some of the “splinters” seen (the only solid objects that did not pulverize into dust) are actually chunks of steel beams that were being exploded upward and laterally. The nicely-sectioned steel beams and girders were soon ordered by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be trucked away and shipped to China – an order that constitutes disturbing a crime scene – which is a federal crime.</p>

<p>The question is: was a woman who preached virtue in suffering rather than trying to alleviate it and took money from dictators really that saintly at all? Douglas Robertson, The Independent, Sep 5, 2016 In looking at the antics surrounding saintliness, George Orwell’s remarks about the important presumption of sinning is all important.  It is axiomatic that all saints be presumed sinners. The greater they are in achievement, heavy in the miracles department and achievement, the less likely they are to be the purest of pure.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Robert Parry</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>Traditional U.S. journalism and the American people are facing a crisis, as the preeminent American newspaper, The New York Times, has fully lost its professional bearings, transforming itself into a neoconservative propaganda sheet eager for a New Cold War with Russia and imposing a New McCarthyism on public debate.</em></p>
<p><em>The crisis is particularly acute because another top national newspaper, The Washington Post, is also deeply inside the neocon camp.</em></p>
<p>The Times’ abandonment of journalistic principles has become most noticeable with its recurring tirades about Russia, as the Times offers up story after story that would have embarrassed Sen. Joe McCarthy and his 1950s Red-baiters.</p>
<p>Operating without any actual evidence, a recent Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/world/europe/russia-sweden-disinformation.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">article</a> by Neil MacFarquhar sought to trace public challenges to official U.S. government narratives on world events to a massive “disinformation” campaign by Russian intelligence. Apparently, it is inconceivable to the Times that independent-minded people might simply question some of the dubious claims made by Official Washington.</p>
<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Cohn_and_McCarthy.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544514]" title="New York Times and the New McCarthyism"><img class="alignright" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Cohn_and_McCarthy-300x291.jpg" alt="Lawyer Roy Cohn (right) with Sen. Joseph McCarthy." width="300" height="291" data-lazy-loaded="true"/></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: Lawyer Roy Cohn (right) with Sen. Joseph McCarthy.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps most stunningly, the Times sought to prove its point by citing the slogan of Russia’s English-language television network, saying: “RT trumpets the slogan ‘Question More.’”</p>
<p>So, now, presumably if someone suggests questioning a claim from the U.S. government or from the NATO alliance, that person is automatically a “Russian agent of influence.” For a major newspaper to adopt such a position is antithetical to the tenets of journalism which call on us journalists to question everything.</p>
<p>The Times’ position is particularly outrageous because many key claims by the U.S. government, including some used to justify aggressive wars against other countries, have turned out to be false. Indeed, the Times has been caught peddling some of these bogus claims, often fed to the “newspaper of record” by U.S. government officials or from think tanks funded by American military contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Disinformation Conduit</strong></p>
<p>Most memorably, in 2002, the Times pushed disinformation about the Iraqi government reconstituting its nuclear weapons program, a lie that was then cited by Vice President Dick Cheney and other senior officials to help stampede the American people behind the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: The controversial map developed by Human Rights Watch and embraced by the New York Times, supposedly showing the flight paths of two missiles from the Aug. 21 Sarin attack intersecting at a Syrian military base.</span></p>
<p>Lesser known moments of the Times serving as a disinformation conduit include <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2013/12/29/nyt-backs-off-its-syria-sarin-analysis/">a discredited assertion</a> about the 2013 sarin attack in Syria, in which the Times purported to show how the flight paths of two missiles traced back to a Syrian military base, only later to grudgingly acknowledge that aeronautical experts judged that the one missile found to be carrying sarin had a maximum range of about one-fourth the required distance.</p>
<p>During the 2014 Ukraine crisis, the Times <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2014/04/23/nyt-retracts-russian-photo-scoop/">accepted photographs</a> from the U.S. State Department which purported to show Russian military personnel in Russia and then later inside Ukraine, except that it turned out that the photograph supposedly taken in Russia was actually taken in Ukraine, destroying the premise of the Times article.</p>
<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/times-propaganda-300x152.png" rel="lightbox[5544514]" title="New York Times and the New McCarthyism"><img class="alignright" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/times-propaganda-300x152-300x152.png" alt="Photograph published by the New York Times purportedly taken in Russia of Russian soldiers who later appeared in eastern Ukraine.

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: Photograph published by the New York Times purportedly taken in Russia of Russian soldiers who later appeared in eastern Ukraine. However, the photographer has since stated that the photo was actually taken in Ukraine, and the U.S. State Department has acknowledged the error.</span></p>
<p>Yet, the Times holds itself out as some paragon of objectivity. This delusion further underscores how out of control and indeed dangerous the Times has become as a source of U.S. government disinformation, while accusing others of spreading Russian disinformation which often isn’t disinformation at all.</p>
<p>In its recent article, the Times cites reasonable questions raised by Swedish citizens about a proposal for the country entering into a military association with NATO and dismisses these concerns as proof of Russian government propaganda and lies:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The claims were alarming: If Sweden, a non-NATO member, signed the deal, the alliance would stockpile secret nuclear weapons on Swedish soil; NATO could attack Russia from Sweden without government approval; NATO soldiers, immune from prosecution, could rape Swedish women without fear of criminal charges.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, all these worries raised by Swedish citizens – and cited by MacFarquhar in the Times – are not unreasonable concerns since nuclear weapons often are stored in NATO countries, NATO members are obliged to go to war to protect allies, and there have been problems with rape cases in countries with NATO or other foreign bases.</p>
<p>How those realities might affect a country agreeing to a NATO military association are reasonable concerns for Swedes to raise, but instead these worries are dismissed as Russian disinformation without any evidence to support the charge.</p>
<p><strong>No Evidence</strong></p>
<p>MacFarquhar even concedes the point that his lead allegation lacks evidentiary support, writing: “As often happens in such cases, Swedish officials were never able to pin down the source of the false reports.”</p>
<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/645997.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544514]" title="New York Times and the New McCarthyism"><img class="alignleft" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/645997-300x200.jpg" alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin, following his address to the UN General Assembly on Sept. 28, 2015. (UN Photo) " width="300" height="200" data-lazy-loaded="true"/></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: Russian President Vladimir Putin, following his address to the UN General Assembly on Sept. 28, 2015. (UN Photo)</span></p>
<p>MacFarquhar then adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>“But they, numerous analysts and experts in American and European intelligence point to Russia as the prime suspect, noting that preventing NATO expansion is a centerpiece of the foreign policy of President Vladimir V. Putin, who invaded Georgia in 2008 largely to forestall that possibility.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Though MacFarquhar cites the Russian “invasion” of Georgia supposedly to thwart its entrance into NATO as a flat fact to support his thesis, that historical reference is a far more complicated issue since it was Georgia that launched an attack on South Ossetia, a breakaway province, and killed Russian peacekeepers stationed there.</p>
<p>An investigation by the European Union <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/6247620/EU-blames-Georgia-for-starting-war-with-Russia.html">laid most of the blame on Georgia</a> for initiating the conflict, with the Russians then reacting to the Georgian assault. A 2009 report on the E.U. mission led by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini rejected Georgian claims about self-defense, finding that Georgia, not Russia, started the conflict.</p>
<p>“None of the explanations given by the Georgian authorities in order to provide some form of legal justification for the attack lend it a valid explanation,” Tagliavini said.</p>
<p>The E.U. report stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There was no ongoing armed attack by Russia before the start of the Georgian operation. Georgian claims of a large-scale presence of Russian armed forces in South Ossetia prior to the Georgian offensive could not be substantiated by the mission. It could also not be verified that Russia was on the verge of such a major attack.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Putin’s military did not “invade” Georgia in 2008 “largely to forestall” Georgia’s entrance into NATO, but as a reaction – arguably an over-reaction – to Georgia’s violent offensive into South Ossetia.</p>
<p>Yet, MacFarquhar cites this dubious point as some sort of indirect “evidence” that Putin is responsible for questions posed by Swedish citizens about what a NATO association would mean for them.</p>
<p>After acknowledging no real evidence and citing a historical “fact” that really isn’t a fact, MacFarquhar expands his conspiracy theory into more recent events claiming that Putin</p>
<blockquote><p>“has invested heavily in a program of ‘weaponized’ information, using a variety of means to sow doubt and division. …</p>
<p>“The fundamental purpose of dezinformatsiya, or Russian disinformation, experts said, is to undermine the official version of events — even the very idea that there is a true version of events — and foster a kind of policy paralysis.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The MH-17 Case</strong></p>
<p>As an example, MacFarquhar cites the case of the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, claiming “Russia pumped out a dizzying array of theories.” The Times correspondent then asserts as flat fact that “The cloud of stories helped veil the simple truth that poorly trained insurgents had accidentally downed the plane with a missile supplied by Russia.”</p>
<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Capture-mh17DSB2.png" rel="lightbox[5544514]" title="New York Times and the New McCarthyism"><img class="alignright" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Capture-mh17DSB2-300x183.png" alt="The Dutch Safety Board's reconstruction of where it believed the missile exploded near Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014." width="300" height="183" data-lazy-loaded="true"/></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: The Dutch Safety Board’s reconstruction of where it believed the missile exploded near Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014.</span></p>
<p>But, according to official investigations that have been underway for more than two years, MacFarquhar’s claim is not “the simple truth,” as he put it. Last year’s report by the Dutch Safety Board reached no conclusion about who was responsible for shooting down the plane, killing 298 people.</p>
<p>Indeed, the DSB’s report included <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/03/16/the-ever-curiouser-mh-17-case/">a statement by Dutch intelligence</a> (reflecting NATO’s intelligence data) that the only powerful anti-aircraft-missile systems in eastern Ukraine on that day – capable of hitting MH-17 at 33,000 feet – were under the control of the Ukrainian military. (Though an official document, this Dutch intelligence report has never been mentioned by The New York Times, presumably because it conflicts with the favored Russia-did-it narrative.)</p>
<p>The U.S. government, which in the five days after the crash did rush to a judgment blaming ethnic Russian rebels supposedly using a Russian-supplied Buk missile, then went silent on the issue after CIA analysts had a chance to examine the evidence in more detail.</p>
<p>Despite appeals from the families of Dutch victims, including the father of the one young American citizen who died in the crash, <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/03/25/kerry-balks-at-supplying-mh-17-data/">the U.S. government has refused to release</a> its radar, satellite images and other intelligence information that presumably could establish exactly who was responsible.</p>
<p>Why the U.S. government would obstruct the investigation into this tragedy if indeed the evidence proved Putin’s responsibility doesn’t make any sense. Indeed, it is the kind of question that a responsible journalist would press the U.S. government to answer, but MacFarquhar and the Times take the pressure off by simply reaffirming the impression that the U.S. government wants the public to have: the Russkies did it.</p>
<p>In the weeks after the crash, I was told by a source briefed by U.S. intelligence analysts that the secret U.S. data points the finger of guilt at a rogue Ukrainian military operation, which would fit with the statement by Dutch intelligence. But whatever the ultimate finding, it is simply bad journalism to state as flat fact something that remains seriously in doubt, a professional failure reminiscent of how the Times and Post treated Iraq’s WMD as a certainty in 2002-2003.</p>
<p><strong>More Insidious</strong></p>
<p>But there is something even more insidious about what The New York Times and The Washington Post have been up to. They are essentially saying that any questioning of the official U.S. government narrative on any international topic puts you in league with Moscow in its purported attempt to “weaponize” information, whatever that is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>The two newspapers are engaging in a breathtaking form of McCarthyism, apparently in some twisted effort to force a neoconservative ideological conformity on the American people in support of the New Cold War.</p>
<p>There is also a stunning lack of self-awareness. While MacFarquhar sees a Russian desire to portray U.S. life as “hellish,” including RT’s decision to show protest demonstrations – rather than some speeches – during the Republican and Democratic conventions, he and other writers who have picked up this theme consistently present the situation in Russia in the darkest possible terms.</p>
<p>Relatively innocent actions, such as the Kremlin seeking to make its case to the world, are transformed into evil deeds, using buzzwords like “weaponized” information and “hybrid war.”. Yet, there is no reference to the billions upon billions of dollars that the U.S. government has invested in disseminating propaganda and funding political activists around the world.</p>
<p>NATO has even established what it calls a “Strategic Communications Command,” or Stratcom, in Riga, Latvia, which – as veteran war correspondent Don North <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2015/09/02/usnato-embrace-psy-ops-and-info-war/">has written</a> – views “the control and manipulation of information as a ‘soft power’ weapon, merging psychological operations, propaganda and public affairs under the catch phrase ‘strategic communications.’</p>
<blockquote><p>“This attitude has led to treating psy-ops manipulative techniques for influencing a target population’s state of mind and surreptitiously shaping people’s perceptions as just a normal part of U.S. and NATO’s information policy. …</p>
<p>“And, as part of this Brave New World of ‘strategic communications,’ the U.S. military and NATO have now gone on the offensive against news organizations that present journalism which is deemed to undermine the perceptions that the U.S. government seeks to convey to the world.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the U.S. government and NATO are engaged in what psychologists call “projection,” accusing someone else of one’s own behavior. Yet The New York Times has never investigated Washington’s and NATO’s involvement in “strategic communications.” Only the Russians do such dirty deeds.</p>
<p><strong>A Darker Side</strong></p>
<p>But there is even a darker side to the Times’ recent propaganda barrage about Russian propaganda. On the heels of MacFarquhar’s indictment of Russia for questioning Washington’s official narratives, the Times published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/world/europe/wikileaks-julian-assange-russia.html?emc=edit_ee_20160901&amp;nl=todaysheadlines-europe&amp;nlid=46363705&amp;_r=2">a vicious attack</a> on WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, entitled “How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West’s Secrets.”</p>
<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/julianassangeincopenhagen.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544514]" title="New York Times and the New McCarthyism"><img class="alignleft" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/julianassangeincopenhagen-300x296.jpg" alt="WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at a media conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. (Photo credit: New Media Days / Peter Erichsen)" width="300" height="296" data-lazy-loaded="true"/></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at a media conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. (Photo credit: New Media Days / Peter Erichsen)</span></p>
<p>The article portrays Assange as a participant, wittingly or otherwise, in Russia’s allegedly nefarious scheme to release truthful information, such as the Democratic National Committee’s emails confirming what many had long suspected, that some party officials were favoring Hillary Clinton over her rival, Bernie Sanders. No one has suggested that the emails aren’t real.</p>
<p>However, without presenting any real evidence proving that Russian intelligence was responsible for the hack, the Times and the rest of the mainstream U.S. news media have made that assumption conventional wisdom based on the opinions of some unnamed U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Or as the Times’ takedown of Assange wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>“United States officials say they believe with a high degree of confidence that the Democratic Party material was hacked by the Russian government. …That raises a question: Has WikiLeaks become a laundering machine for compromising material gathered by Russian spies? And more broadly, what precisely is the relationship between Mr. Assange and Mr. Putin’s Kremlin? …</p>
<p>“Among United States officials, the emerging consensus is that Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks probably have no direct ties to Russian intelligence services. But they say that, at least in the case of the Democrats’ emails, Moscow knew it had a sympathetic outlet in WikiLeaks, where intermediaries could drop pilfered documents in the group’s anonymized digital inbox.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Though it’s nice that some U.S. officials acknowledge a lack of evidence proving an operational relationship between Assange and Russian intelligence, the fact that a high-profile journalistic institution, such as WikiLeaks, has been under that sort of U.S. government investigation should be troubling to the Times and other news organizations.</p>
<p>However, instead the newspaper appears disappointed that it cannot declare outright that Assange is a “Moscow stooge.” (Also note that in the last passage, the Times treats the suspicion that Russian intelligence hacked the Democratic emails as flat fact when U.S. intelligence officials say they don’t know for sure.)</p>
<p><strong>Verify, Don’t Moralize</strong></p>
<p>The usual rule of thumb for journalists is to accept and verify information regardless of where it comes from. While occasionally you get a selfless leaker, it’s more common to get leaks from interested parties seeking to undermine their rivals. We see that in legal proceedings when lawyers supply documents helpful to their cases and in political contests when campaigns dig up dirt on their opponents.</p>
<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-01-18t12-04-30-766z-1280x720.nbcnews-ux-1080-600.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544514]" title="New York Times and the New McCarthyism"><img class="alignright" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-01-18t12-04-30-766z-1280x720.nbcnews-ux-1080-600-300x169.jpg" alt="Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen.

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders. (NBC photo)</span></p>
<p>Yet, journalists don’t throw away newsworthy information because it may be self-serving. We check it out and – if it checks out – we use it. The only real problem would be if you run the material as flat fact, without caveats, and it turns out to be false, as has happened repeatedly with material that the U.S. government has leaked to the Times and the Post.</p>
<p>What is particularly unprofessional about how the Times is treating Assange is that no one is saying that the Democratic Party emails are disinformation; they appear to be quite real and reflect a newsworthy concern, which is: Did the Democratic National Committee seek to throw the presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton?</p>
<p>But the Times’ unprofessional treatment of truthful information from WikiLeaks as well as the Times’ disdain for legitimate debate about the New Cold War with Russia has contributed to another dangerous development – a McCarthyistic launching of official U.S. government investigations into people who question the official Washington narratives.</p>
<p><strong>An Official Investigation</strong></p>
<p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/intelligence-community-investigating-covert-russian-influence-operations-in-the-united-states/2016/09/04/aec27fa0-7156-11e6-8533-6b0b0ded0253_story.html">reported</a> on Tuesday that</p>
<blockquote><p>“U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in U.S. political institutions. …</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/800px-Washington_Post_building.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544514]" title="New York Times and the New McCarthyism"><img class="alignleft" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/800px-Washington_Post_building-300x225.jpg" alt="The Washington Post building.

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Image: The Washington Post building. (Photo credit: Daniel X. O’Neil)</span></p>
<blockquote><p>“The aim is to understand the scope and intent of the Russian campaign, which incorporates cyber-tools to hack systems used in the political process, enhancing Russia’s ability to spread disinformation. … A Russian influence operation in the United States ‘is something we’re looking very closely at,’ said one senior intelligence official,”</p></blockquote>
<p>while admitting that there is no “definitive proof” of such a Russian scheme.</p>
<p>The danger of this investigation – and what a normal news media would focus on – is the U.S. government taking an unfocused look at how Russia supposedly influences the U.S. public debate, a probe that could easily cross the line into questioning the loyalty of Americans who simply dispute what the U.S. government is claiming about current events.</p>
<p>The Post reported,</p>
<blockquote><p>“U.S. intelligence officials described the [Russian] covert influence campaign here as ‘ambitious’ and said it is also designed to counter U.S. leadership and influence in international affairs. …</p>
<p>“Russia has been in the vanguard of a growing global movement to use propaganda on the Internet to influence people and political events, especially since the political revolt in Ukraine, the subsequent annexation of Crimea by Russia, and the imposition of sanctions on Russia by the United States and the European Union. …</p>
<p>“‘Our studies show that it is very likely that [the influence] operations are centrally run,’ said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, a research organization based in Riga, Latvia.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that is the same NATO Stratcom complex that, as Don North reported, blends psychological operations with traditional public relations. Yet, you wouldn’t know that from reading The Washington Post’s article, which cites Stratcom as a source for accusing Russia of running influence operations.</p>
<p><strong>A Vast Conspiracy</strong></p>
<p>According to the Post, Sarts</p>
<blockquote><p>“also said there is ‘a coordinated effort involving [groups using] Twitter and Facebook and networks of bots to amplify their message. The main themes seem to be orchestrated rather high up in the hierarchy of the Russian state, and then there are individual endeavors by people to exploit specific themes.’</p>
<p>“Sarts said the Russian propaganda effort has been ‘successful in exploiting the vulnerabilities within societies.’ In Western Europe, for instance, such Russian information operations have focused on the politically divisive refugee crisis.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, any reporting or commenting on significant foreign policy issues could open a journalist or a citizen to a U.S. government investigation into whether you are part of some nefarious Russian propaganda/disinformation scheme.</p>
<p>This McCarthyistic investigative style has already begun to have a chilling effect on public debate in the United States where dissident views on Russia, Syria or other hot topics are quickly disparaged as enemy propaganda. Almost anyone who questions whether a new, costly and dangerous Cold War is necessary is immediately tagged as a “Russian agent of influence,” a “Putin apologist,” or a “Moscow stooge.”</p>
<p>In this case, the Democrats have been particularly aggressive in playing the Joe McCarthy role by denouncing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in such overheated terms, even suggesting his disloyalty for suggesting that he could, as President, get along with Putin.</p>
<p>During the McCarthy era of the 1950s, defense of freedom of thought required courageous journalists, most notably Edward R. Murrow, to stand up to the often unfounded smears against the patriotism of Americans. In 2016, however, it is the prestige news media, particularly The New York Times and The Washington Post, that have been leading the rush into the New Cold War and into the New McCarthyism.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Patrick Martin</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton this week publicly accused the Russian government of intervening in the American election on behalf of her Republican opponent Donald Trump.</em></p>
<p>She cited an investigation by US intelligence agencies, first reported Monday night by the <em>Washington Post</em>, into alleged Russian government hacking into the computer systems of the state election officials in the United States.</p>
<p>Clinton told a press conference Monday there were now “credible reports about Russian interference in our elections,” adding, “I want everyone—Democrat, Republican, Independent—to understand the real threat that this represents.”</p>
<p>Clinton referred both to the <em>Post</em> report about hacking into state government computers in Arizona and Illinois, and to the alleged Russian hacking of the emails of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which revealed backroom efforts by top DNC officials to ensure Clinton’s victory.</p>
<p>Clinton’s suggestion of a Trump-Putin axis was followed up Tuesday in a speech in North Carolina by her vice-presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, which was billed as a “major national security address” by the Democratic campaign.</p>
<p>Kaine contrasted Clinton’s going “toe-to-toe with Putin” as US secretary of state, to Trump’s suggestion that NATO was outmoded and that he could negotiate more successfully with Russia. He then raised the question “why Trump seems to support Russian interests at the expense of American ones,” suggesting that the billionaire real estate speculator was keeping his tax returns secret because they might shed light on his financial ties to Russia. He concluded by citing the claim of former acting CIA Director Michael Morell that Trump is an “unwitting agent” of the Russian intelligence services.</p>
<p>Clinton appeared Monday at several Labor Day rallies, but she chose to focus her attack on Trump on national security issues, where she has consistently attacked the billionaire real estate speculator from the right.</p>
<p>Asked by a reporter if the alleged Russian actions amounted to a cyberwar, Clinton replied, “I’m not comfortable using the word ‘war’.” This demurral was only to disguise her intentions from the American people. However, in a speech last week to the American Legion convention, Clinton declared that cyberattacks on the United States should be answered by military force.</p>
<p>Clinton claimed that Putin had all but confirmed Russia’s role in the hacking of the DNC—a flat-out lie—adding, “The team around him certainly believe that there is some benefit to them to doing this.” She then declared that the prospect of additional hacking into the state government systems used to conduct the November 8 elections represented “a threat from an adversarial foreign power.”</p>
<p>The Democratic candidate also criticized the role of the Russian government in Syria, in backing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against Islamist forces armed and financed by the United States and the Gulf monarchies. She denounced “the refusal of the Russians and the Iranians to put the kind of pressure on Assad that is necessary …”</p>
<p>Clinton reiterated her support for imposing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria held by the US-backed “rebels,” which would require US air strikes against Syrian anti-aircraft positions and could lead to confrontations between Russian and American warplanes, which both conduct air strikes in the country.</p>
<p>“I think we need leverage,” she said. “I’ve always believed that if that were on the table and it were clear we were going to pursue it, that would give us the leverage we don’t have now.” Coming just after the well-publicized failure of talks last weekend between Obama and Putin at the G20 summit in China, Clinton was clearly seeking to stake out a more aggressive position on Syria than that of the Obama administration.</p>
<p>The Democrat’s claim to have discovered a Trump-Putin axis has two purposes: first, to cement Clinton’s standing as the consensus choice of the US military-intelligence apparatus; and second, to integrate the election campaign itself into the war preparations by US imperialism, both in the Middle East and against Russia (as well as China).</p>
<p>If Clinton wins the November 8 election over Trump, she will claim this to be a mandate for the escalation of US military operations in Iraq and Syria, as well as the continued NATO military buildup throughout Eastern Europe, openly aimed at preparing for war with Russia, a country with the world’s second-largest nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>In her complaints about Russian interference in the US elections, Clinton is joining in the campaign waged by the Pentagon and CIA to prepare US public opinion for such a conflict.</p>
<p>The article published Monday by the <em>Washington Post</em> is little more than a handout from the intelligence agencies. It reports that the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security have started an investigation, led by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, into a “broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in US political institutions.”</p>
<p>In addition to discrediting the election among the American people—hardly necessary given that the entire political system is deeply despised and the two main candidates hated—Russian officials allegedly seek to “provide propaganda fodder to attack US democracy-building policies around the world,” the <em>Post</em> claimed.</p>
<p>As in previous reports by the <em>Post</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> about alleged Russian hacking of the DNC, no evidence of any kind is cited in the article, only the unsupported claims of intelligence officials, who even the <em>Post </em>reporters admit lack “definitive proof” of either cyberattacks or even plans for cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Apparently the public is expected to treat such claims as the gospel, despite the decades of lying by these agencies to cover up assassinations, coup plots and other conspiracies abroad, and the systematic violation of the democratic rights of the American people at home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the claims of Russian hacking are being used to whip up a crisis atmosphere about the administration of the election itself. Earlier this summer the FBI issued a “flash” alert to election officials in all 50 states over the threat of cyber intrusions. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson suggested that the entire US election system, including 9,000 polling places and 50 separate state election authorities, should be declared “critical infrastructure” subject to the same counterterrorism efforts as nuclear power plants and electrical power grids.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Andre Damon</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>On Tuesday, the New York Times published as its front-page lead article a piece, written by longtime military/intelligence insider David Sanger, reporting internal White House discussions that the Obama administration is planning on maintaining the United States’ “first strike” nuclear weapons policy.</em></p>
<p>In recent months, the <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>Times</em> had published reports that President Obama had considered formally adopting a policy of not using nuclear weapons unless the US was attacked by such weapons first.</p>
<p>On July 10, The <em>Washington Post</em> reported, “The Obama administration is determined to use its final six months in office to take a series of executive actions to advance the nuclear agenda the president has advocated since his college days,” including the possible adoption of a “no first use” policy.</p>
<p>But Tuesday’s report in the <em>Times</em> declared that Obama “appears likely to abandon the proposal after top national security advisers argued” that it would “embolden Russia and China.”</p>
<p>The move takes place amidst a series of US provocations against both countries, including the deployment of thousands of troops on Russia’s border in Eastern Europe and ongoing “freedom of navigation” operations in the South China Sea. In their statements to the <em>Times</em>, White House and military officials were sending a clear signal that it will abide no scaling back of the US threat to kill millions of people to facilitate its geopolitical aims.</p>
<p>The White House decided ultimately to agree to the demands of Commander of Strategic Command Admiral Haney, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, Secretary of State John Kerry and others who declared, according to the<em>Times</em>, that “new moves by Russia and China, from the Baltic to the South China Sea, made it the wrong time to issue the declaration.”</p>
<p>Both before and during his presidency, Obama had postured as a proponent of nuclear non-proliferation. In his April 2009 speech in Prague, Obama declared that “as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon,” the US is committed “to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons,” and that “to put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Obama visited Hiroshima, Japan, becoming the first sitting US president to do so since President Truman made the decision to incinerate the city with an atomic weapon at the end of the Second World War. Despite ruling out any apology for this war crime, Obama hypocritically called on countries that possess nuclear weapons to “have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them.”</p>
<p>Yet Obama’s real “nuclear legacy” is something else entirely. Over his eight years in office, the White House has initiated one of the most sweeping expansions of its nuclear capabilities in US history.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has embarked upon a $1 trillion nuclear modernization program, seeking to make US nuclear weapons smaller, faster, more maneuverable and easier to use on the battlefield. The effect of this program is, as General James E. Cartwright, a retired vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the <em>Times </em>earlier this year, “to make the weapon more thinkable.”</p>
<p>At a cost of some $97 billion, the Navy is on track to replace its Ohio-class submarines, each of which is by itself equivalent to the world’s fifth-ranking nuclear power, with a new generation of ballistic missile submarines.</p>
<p>The Air Force, meanwhile, has contracted Northrop Grumman to build up to 100 next-generation B-21 nuclear-capable bombers, at a cost of nearly $60 billion. It is also in the midst of developing, at the cost of $20 billion, the so-called Long-Range Stand-Off Missile, which is capable of maneuvering at high speeds to deliver a nuclear payload behind enemy air defenses.</p>
<p>Experts have warned that the development of such a “dual use” nuclear-capable cruise missile makes the potential for a catastrophic miscalculation substantially greater, as countries attacked by these weapons, in addition to having little time to respond, have no way of knowing whether their payload is “conventional” or nuclear.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that the Air Force also plans to spend another $85 billion to develop a set of new intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Pentagon is moving ahead with plans to buy some 642 of the new ICBMs “at an average cost of $66.4 million each to support a deployed force of 400 weapons.”</p>
<p>The dizzying pace of the US nuclear modernization program comes in the context of a deepening global geopolitical crisis, at the center of which is the ever expanding war drive of American imperialism.</p>
<p>Beginning with economic crises of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the American ruling class sought to offset the economic decline of US capitalism through the naked use of military force. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this process went into overdrive, kicking off a quarter century of intensifying war around the globe. Now, US-led regional wars and proxy conflicts, particularly in Syria, are metastasizing into ever-more direct conflicts with larger competitors, including Russia and China.</p>
<p>With the crisis-ridden US election dominated by allegations from the Clinton campaign of Russian cyberattacks and political subversion, together with ongoing and deepening tensions with China, the United States is sending a clear signal that it is thinking about the “unthinkable.”</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky warned, “In the period of crisis the hegemony of the United States will operate more completely, more openly, and more ruthlessly than in the period of boom.” Anyone who believes that the US would never again use nuclear weapons is underestimating not only the extent of the internal and external crisis confronting American imperialism, but the level of violence and criminality of which the American ruling class is capable.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Mark Taliano</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Two years ago, “Majd” wrote these words on a Facebook posting:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220; <em>I am Syrian… living in Syria in the middle of everything. We have seen horrors. It was never a revolution nor a civil war. The terrorists are sent by your goverment. They are al Qaeda Jabhat al Nusra Wahhabi Salafists Talibans etc and the extremist jihadists sent by the West, the Saudis, Qatar and Turkey. Your Obama and whoever is behind him or above him are supporting al Qaeda and leading a proxy war on my country. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The majority here loves Assad. He has never committed a crime against his own people… The chemical attack was staged by the terrorists helped by the USA and the UK,  etc. Everyone knows that here. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>American soldiers and people should not be supporting barbarian al Qaeda terrorists who are killing Christians, Muslims in my country and everyone. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Every massacre is committed by them. We were all happy in Syria: we had free school and university education available for everyone, free healthcare, no GMO, no fluoride, no chemtrails, no Rothschild IMF- controlled bank, state owned central bank which gives 11% interest, we are self-sufficient and have no foreign debt to any country or bank. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Life before the crisis was so beautiful here. Now it is hard and horrific in some regions. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I do not understand how the good and brave American people can accept to bomb my country which has never harmed them and therefore help the barbarian al Qaeda. These animals slit throats and behead for pleasure… they behead babies and rape young kids. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>They are satanic. Our military helped by the millions of civilian militias are winning the battle against al Qaeda. But now the USA wants to bomb the shit out of us so that al Qaeda can get the upper hand. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Please help us American people. They are destroying the cradle of civilization. Stop your government. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Impeach that bankster puppet you have as president&#8230; support Ron Paul or Rand or anyone the like who are true American patriots. but be sure of one.thing..if they attack and I think they will&#8230;.it will be hell. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Be sure that if it were to be a world war, many many will die. Syria can and will defend itself and will sink many US ships. Iran will go to war..Russia and China eventually if it escalates… and all this for what ? For the elites who created al Qaeda through the US government and use it to conduct proxy wars and destabilize countries which do not go along with their new world order agenda !!?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> American people&#8230;you gotta regain control of your once admirable country. Now everyone hates you for.the.death you bring almost everywhere. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Ask the Iraqis…the Afghans…the Pakistanis…the Palestinians…the Syrians&#8230;the Macedonians and Serbs&#8230;the Libyans&#8230;the Somalis&#8230;the Yemenis &#8230;.all the ones you kill with drones everyday. Stop your wars, Enough wars. Use diplomacy..dialogue&#8230;help..not force.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Consistent testimonies from Syrians, as well as well-documented, open-source Western sources, and historical memory, <strong>all serve to reinforce the accuracy of the aforementioned testimony.</strong></p>
<p>Syrians are living the horror brought to them by the criminal West.  They can not afford the complacency of shrugging their shoulders in indecision, not when their lives and their ancient civilization is being threatened by Western-paid terrorist mercenaries of the worst kind.</p>
<p>“Our” proxies, slit throats, chop heads, and take no prisoners as we waffle in indecision, ignore empirical evidence, and take the comfortable easy road of believing the <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-wests-establishment-lies-and-crimes-are-leading-us-to-the-unthinkable/5535307">labyrinth of lies</a>  promulgated by Western media messaging.</p>
<p>The veil of comfortable confusion, nested in an unconscious belief that our government knows best or that it is patriotic to believe the lies and fabrications implicit in the hollow words of politicians (who no longer represent us) and the false pronouncements of Imperial messengers, is concealing an <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Western-Imposed-Holocaust-by-Mark-Taliano-Government_Innocent_Intervention_Propaganda-150728-765.html">overseas holocaust</a>.</p>
<p>Western societies are rotting from the inside out because of these lies and this barbarity.  We are protecting a criminal cabal of corporate globalists who do not serve our interests and never will.</p>
<p>Our democracies, which we should be protecting, have long disappeared – except in the hollow words of newspaper stenographers.  Instead we are supporting <a href="http://ahtribune.com/opinion/749-canadian-oligarchy.html">transnational corporate elites</a> and their delusional projects.</p>
<p>Poverty and disemployment are all soaring beneath the fakery of government pronouncements, as the public domain evaporates beneath words like “efficiency” or the “economy” &#8212; all false covers that serve to enrich elites and destroy us.  Internal imperialism at home is a faded replica of the foreign imperialism abroad.</p>
<p>As countries are destroyed, and its peoples are slaughtered &#8212; think Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and others &#8212; by abhorrent Western proxies &#8212; public institutions are contaminated, and ultimately replaced by parasitical “privatized” facsimiles.  Public banking is looted and destroyed in favour of transnational banksterism, World Bank funding, and IMF usury.  Food security is destroyed and replaced by biotech tentacles and engineered dependencies on cash crops and unhealthy food.  Currencies are destroyed, sanctions are imposed, and the unknown, unseen hand of totalitarian control imposes itself, amidst the cloud of diversions and confusions, aided by comprador regimes, oligarch interests, and shrugging domestic populations.</p>
<p>Syria refuses to submit.  That is why the West is taught to hate her, and the rest of the world learns to love and respect her.</p>
<p>Yet, Syria’s struggles are our struggles.  Syria represents international law, stability, and integrity: the same values that western peoples overtly cherish but stubbornly reject, as our countries wilt beneath suffocating veils of <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/neo-con-west-and-global-destruction/5538644">lies and delusions</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I support Syria, because I respect what remains of international law.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I support Syria because I reject Wahhabism, Sharia law, and terrorism.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I support Syria because I reject the undemocratic, transnational oligarchies that are subverting our once flourishing, now dead, democracies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I reject the lies of our <a href="http://ahtribune.com/politics/73-mainstream-media-corrupt.html">propagandizing media</a>, the hollow words of our politicians, and the fake   “humanitarian” messaging that demonizes non-belligerent countries and their populations.</p>
<p>In the name of justice, humanity, and the rule of law, I support the elected government of Syria led by its President, Bashar al-Assad.  Syria, an ancient cradle of civilization, is leading the way towards a better future for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>All we have to do is open our eyes.</strong></p>

<p><em>On August 10th, Kunle Ekunkonye arrived in Boston from his home in Miami to promote his new documentary, &#8220;Community Doctors.&#8221; The film highlights Cuba&#8217;s medical scholarship program for young people from around the world, but especially focuses on U.S. students at the Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM). Kunle wrote, directed and filmed the documentary. His brother, Akin Ekunkonye, graduated from ELAM in July and is credited as the producer of the film.</em></p>
<p>Kunle is a software engineer and this is his first film. Visiting his brother at ELAM awakened such passion and interest that he decided to dedicate a period of four years to making a documentary that would help inform the world about this valuable project that has graduated 24,000 doctors from some 120 countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to show that this program trains very high-level professionals, people who are doing very good work in the United States. It is an opportunity for very low-income people who cannot afford to enter medical schools and in Cuba have the opportunity to become good doctors for free,&#8221; Kunle Ekunkonye states.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>Although it is a resource-poor country Cuba has developed a highly effective medical system. Their health outcomes are on par with those of the United States. Cuba has provided thousands of doctors to work in medically underserved areas in countries around the world to restore those communities from the impact of natural disasters, epidemics and the widespread lack of medical care.</p>
<p>In 1999 Cuba opened the Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM) to give medical scholarships to the brightest from poor areas around the world so that they may become doctors that will eventually return and serve the communities from which they came.</p>
<p>Due to decades of political animosity between the United States and Cuba, of which have only recently began to normalize, information about Cuba has been relatively scant. Despite the impasse in diplomatic relations, Cuba provided the offer of free medical scholarships for students in the United States.</p>
<p>The film tells the story of the medical scholarship program and the young Americans, many from poor and underserved communities in the United States, who were awarded full scholarships to study medicine at the Latin American School of Medicine in Havana, Cuba. The program is a 6-7 year, fully Spanish, hands-on experience that prepares students to become doctors that are skilled at preventing diseases and treating patients in low-resource conditions with an interwoven focus on community building. At a time when Cuba itself remained off-limits to most Americans, the students and graduates of ELAM share their experiences, challenges, lessons and hopes as they are fully immersed in a new culture while learning a unique and radically different approach to medicine and healthcare</p>

<div class="content">
<p><em>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has set up an online database of financial horror stories that shows what happens when an average American interacts with one of the financial supermarkets (a/k/a universal banks) that grew out of the repeal of the investor protection legislation known as the Glass-Steagall Act. The complaints are concentrated against the biggest Wall Street banks.</em></p>
<p>If you are one of the lucky Americans who has not already been mugged in the shopping aisles of the financial supermarkets, you should carefully browse through the database to see what awaits the unwary. Just go to the <a href="https://data.consumerfinance.gov/dataset/Consumer-Complaints/s6ew-h6mp">complaint archive</a>, and place the name of any bank you want to examine in the upper right-hand search box. Searching under the name Citibank (part of the Wall Street behemoth Citigroup) will bring up 29,000 rows of complaints. A search under Chase, part of the mega Wall Street bank, JPMorgan Chase, brings up 37,000 rows of complaints. After years of being charged by Federal regulators for abusing their customers and the public trust, both U.S. banks became felons on May 20 of last year when they admitted to felony charges related to rigging foreign currency markets.</p>
<p>Wall Street banks are intended to function as efficient allocators of capital to grow new businesses and industries in America. But since the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed in 1999 under pressure from Citigroup, Wall Street’s biggest banks increasingly function as legalized loan sharking operations – targeting the poor, minorities and financially unsophisticated. In what has become a highly efficient, wealth transfer mechanism, billions of dollars each month move from the pockets of those least able to protect themselves from financial abuse to the coffers of the one percent in America who sit in the executive offices of these banks.</p>
<p>Under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, banks holding insured deposits were not allowed to be affiliated with Wall Street investment banks and brokerage firms — which have a storied history of stock frauds, abusing their customers, and blowing up. That protection was removed when President Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act on November 12, 1999, the legislation that repealed the Glass-Steagall Act. After protecting the nation for 66 years, it took just 9 years after its repeal for Wall Street to implode, taking the U.S. economy with it.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton and his Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin, ushered in the era of the financial supermarket that has trapped America in a time warp of 1920s-style abuses on Wall Street and the income and wealth inequality that it has spawned. Rubin had the audacity to head straight for Citigroup’s Board after stepping down as U.S. Treasury Secretary, collecting $126 million in compensation over the next decade.</p>
<p>This year Senator Bernie Sanders’ supporters were able to pressure the Democrats to include the restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act into this year’s Democratic Party Platform, but political watchers were shocked that it also ended up in the Republican Party’s Platform as well. The financial atrocities coming out of the publicly accessible database set up by the CFPB has sent a chill through both parties. Behind the scenes, both Democrats and Republicans believe there could be another epic crash like that of 2008 and neither wants the other party pointing the finger and saying, you blocked us from restoring the Glass-Steagall Act.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Phil Butler</p>

<div class="content">
<p><em>The United States of America leads western allies in an unholy war on not just the Arab world, but against any nation that stands in the way of total domination. The evidence of an underlying master plan grows more prevalent each day. No one seems to have characterized what the ends of this campaign will look like, but the stunningly diabolical strategy the Bush and Obama presidencies undertook are there for all to see. Here is a window into the greatest power play in history.</em></p>
<p>I was a bit surprised this morning, when I came to the realization Libya’s Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi was among the richest men who ever lived. Experts now claim that Gaddafi was worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 billion dollars when US backed rebels tortured and killed him in October of 2011. Though I understood how Obama and Hillary Clinton had played a role in his death, I had originally discounted rumors and speculation he was killed over his billions, and over his leaning away from the dollar as a preferred international exchange medium were boundless.</p>
<p>Today I discover <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/25/executive-order-13566-libya" target="_blank">Executive Order 13566 </a>for the first time, and Gaddafi’s death makes all the more sense in the overall context. As it turns out, the Libyan leader was among the richest on Earth, and the plan to do away with him originated at the highest levels of world leadership. What’s more, a clear and systematic sequence of events can be linked, a chain of evidence leads to the White House and beyond. Executive Order 13566 was executed February 25th, 2011, just eight days after major protests broke out against Gaddafi’s government. The order reads in part:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates have taken extreme measures against the people of Libya, including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed civilians.  I further find that there is a serious risk that Libyan state assets will be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close associates if those assets are not protected.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>On this same day Stuart Levey, the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence who drafted Executive Order 13566, put in action the plan to sequester billions stored in banks around the U.S. Once US embassy personnel had been evacuated from Libya, Obama’s people sprung into action with the help of bank employees who had been waiting through the night. In all, some $30 billion in cash and liquid assets were seized. As of the Summer of 2015, Gaddafi assets in the amount of $60 billion had been seized by banks in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>These funds are now in limbo, as a nebulous leadership of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) hides amid a shadowy world of global financiers. To be blunt, the Gaddafi billions pay no benefit to the people of Libya, but only to the bankers and speculators who leveraged the funds originally. $60 billion in “loans” let’s say, may never be called in.</p>
<p>At least this is a layman’s way of understanding what is going on. Today multi-billion dollar <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/11594063/Dramatic-power-struggle-at-Libyan-wealth-fund-deals-setback-to-1.2bn-Goldman-Sachs-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">lawsuits against</a> the likes of Hillary Clinton supporters Goldman Sachs, infighting over who is in control of the LIA, and countless under the table dealings further darken what was and is a monumental stain on US international relationships. If this were the 1930s and mafia land, there would be newspaper headlines accusing Barack Obama of committing a heist on behalf of Wall Street. And the more evidence that crosses WikiLeaks wires, the more clear Arab Spring’s real goals become. In one of the most bizarre geo-political catastrophes ever, a British court may well decide who is in charge of Gaddafi’s billions. The horde that the Obama White House said belonged to the people of Libya, currently belongs on bankers’ balance sheets. These banking and investment ties betray the more militaristic geo-policy being played by the Obama White House.</p>
<p>The American, British, and EU leadership have been busy as bees fueling chaos in the Arab world. As a by product, the refugee and west versus east mess that blazes now further inhibit peace and prosperity. It took me all of 10 seconds to find linkages and curiosities via WikiLeaks. This cable from 2008 reveals the UK government sanctioning three Libyan Islamists from an organization known as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), a group known to have attempted the assassination of Gaddafi, in order to install a more fundamentally extremist regime.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the US was not sought as a co-sponsor for labeling three members terrorists under United Nations Security Council resolution 1267. Of particular interest is a man named Maftah Mohamed ElMabruk, a key member of LIFG, now an Al Qaeda cell group, who was protected by the British previously. The names and alleged complicity in terror in this document stand in stark contrast to the fact three Libyan terrorists were later found to be supplying arms to the Syrian opposition of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. As it turned out, the LIFG, working on behalf of the Libyan Islamist Abel Hakim Belhadj, was being run by none other than Britain’s Blair and MI6.</p>
<p>It was the LIFG that MI6 used to carry out several operations inside Libya, including the 1996 attempt to assassinate Colonel Qaddafi. The group originated alongside al-Qaeda inside Afghanistan, about the time US policymakers lured the USSR into that country in what Carter administration National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski bragged:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war.”</p></blockquote>
<p>American policy having come full circle, it’s crystal clear the American people have been totally misled. The useless struggles of the past are now ushered into the spotlight. What’s even more contemptible is the fact the EU is moving to restore valididity for these jihadists. This story tells of one UN sanctioned LIFG operative named Abdulbasit Abdulrahim being supported by the same EU refugees now pour into. Whether or not Abdulrahim was a member of the LIFG or not, the idea the US can make someone a terrorist one minute, and that the same terrorist is redeemed by the EU the next, it speaks volumes for any argument against paranoid security states. The Bush and Obama administrations have pushed the boundaries of believability into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The overthrow of Gaddafi by the American administration, with the help of the United Nations, will go down in history as the kindling of the most catastrophic foreign policy scheme in history. The evidence surfacing now can only lead us to one conclusion. Take the fact the former head of the LIFG, Norman Benotman is currently the president of Quillam Foundation in London, and the fact he was in Tripoli working with the British government at the time of Gaddafi’s demise, attest to the dastardly and deep game of subterfuge affecting us all.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nbenotman?lang=en" target="_blank">Benotman Tweets today</a>, in prolific and cryptic 140 characters that appear insane, or at best unbalanced. Without delving into this character’s mysterious past, suffice it to point out that Quilliam was established in 2007 by Ed Husain, Maajid Nawaz and Rashad Zaman Ali, three former members of the Islamist group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizb_ut-Tahrir" target="_blank">Hizb ut-Tahrir</a>. Named for the controversial  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Quilliam" target="_blank">William Quilliam</a>, the society is based on the concept of a global caliphate, its namesake having sworn allegiance to the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Though the Quilliam organization appears outwardly to be a shill puppet of Britain’s anti-extremist Islam operation, some experts wonder if the organization is not operating in a “duality” of purpose. Either way, the intended goals of LIFG have been well served by Benotman and other assets. From my perspective as a dissenter to the mainstream propaganda, simply discovering Quilliam’s founding father is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExdZy_d8s-k" target="_blank">Maajid Nawaz</a>, Op-Ed master at the ubiquitous tabloid The Daily Beast, is enough to categorize the organization as part of the problem, and no the solution to world chaos. Ties in between Nawaz, the <a href="https://gennextfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Next Gen Foundation</a> Quilliam shares offices with in the US, and ultimately former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, they whisper “double agent” to me. This is only speculative on my part though. I won’t start connecting the dots that lead to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/04/26/google-ideas-backs-effort-to-curb-violent-extremists/" target="_blank">Google</a>, the Clinton Foundation, and the neoconservative lifelines holding up Clinton for President either. Our whole system<a href="http://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/self-invention-maajid-nawaz-fact-and-fiction-life-counter-terror-celebrity" target="_blank">becomes suspect</a>, as certainly it must.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/6528" target="_blank">this WikiLeaks revelation</a> further amplifies the Obama administration’s duplicity in Gaddafi’s remise. Hillary Clinton’s staff was closely monitoring the effects the Obama bank seizures were having on the Gaddafi government. Now that the greater interest in Gaddafi billions by the likes of Clinton fans Goldman Sachs has come to light, one has to wonder at the former Secretary of State’s interests. Were these billions earmarked like other Clinton business focused directives? WikiLeaks is an evidence treasure trove on Clinton opportunism, one that only recently showed her conflict of interest where places like Libya and corporate business are concerned. It seems fair to predict that these American leaders, their counterparts in London, may soon be under indictment for more than just illegal email servers. Clinton appeared more interested in Gaddafi gold than in a peaceful resolution for Libya. I quote from her communiqué of April 1, 2011, just after President Obama seized upwards of $60 billion:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On April 2, 2011 sources with access to advisors to Salt al-Islam Qaddafi stated in strictest confidence that while the freezing of Libya’s foreign bank accounts presents Muammar Qaddafi with serious challenges, his ability to equip and maintain his armed forces and intelligence services remains intact. According to sensitive information available to this these individuals, Qaddafi’s government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver. During late March, 2011 these stocks were moved to SABHA (south west in the direction of the Libyan border with Niger and Chad); taken from the vaults of the Libyan Central Bank in Tripoli.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Is the United States of America assuming the role of Imperialist super-nation? Based on what I’ve learned in the last three years, this was always our role. Spreading democracy and the “American Way” was once something most of my countrymen would have been proud to live, work, fight and die for. Unfortunately for the brave souls interred at Arlington Cemetery, democracy had nothing whatever to do with our leadership’s goals. Gaddafi was portrayed for us, from the Potomac to studios in Hollywood, as an arch villain US Navy Seals should snuff out. Libya was always he rogue, with Tom Clancy novels and blockbuster movies tightly focused, so Americans would turn a blind eye when the time came.</p>
<p>Well, the time has come. The Middle East is a hornet’s nest, one overflowing onto the shores of once peaceful and prosperous nations. Russia is being forced to rearm, China has gone from a touted globalization partner into a big red scary enemy again. In Europe the rightist rational is being fed a new human fodder, Muslims who can take the place of Jews as the next holocaust is set in motion. Barack Obama won the Novel Peace Prize as a joke, as a test, for the elites to jab at their protectorate – and when we did not laugh out loud they knew for sure – the world was ripe for the picking. Is Barack Obama to blame for a coming World War III? He is until those really underneath are brought to justice.</p>
<p>We are witness to the fall, the fall of the ideal of freedom.</p>

<p><strong>The US presidential election just keeps getting faker</strong></p>
<p><em>The more it goes on. Yes, it’s <strong>bread and circus time</strong> again in America, but this time around the rulers are putting on an entertainment show which has lost its ability to convince and persuade. It’s just too damn fake. </em></p>
<p><em>We know the US and many other Western “democracies” are rigged one-party states where all the major candidates are controlled, bribed and/or blackmailed. We know that US presidents are selected, not elected. In the 2016 US presidential election, we’ve witnessed all sorts of fakery right from the start. Hillary blatantly rigged the Democratic Primaries in several states (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgCK2GY9gE4">Iowa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2gJgyIC8Sg">Nevada</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2togSItA77E">Arizona</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoGeDGHmwJU">California</a> just to name a few). She colluded with the DNC board, led by the disgraced Wasserman-Schultz, to keep Bernie out of the nomination. Then, at the DNC convention, she pulled out all the stops with a grand display of riggery and fakery, including paying people to sit there to hold her signs, playing white noise machines to drown out protests, having DNC officials turn off the lights above Bernie supporters to plunge them into darkness and all sorts of other dirty tricks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hillary’s Fake Health and Fake Transparency</strong></p>
<p>The fakery continued after Clinton’s <del>nomination</del> coronation as queen at the DNC. Ever since the topic of Hillary’s health has come to light, Hillary has been in damage control mode, trying to convince a skeptical public she is well enough for the office of president, despite her coughing fits, bouts of dizziness and confusion, struggling to walk up stairs, tripping and falling, bouts of inappropriate laughter, wild crossed-eyed looks and her public seizures (see <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/real-hillary-clinton/"><em>The Real Hillary Clinton</em></a> for more info). Wikileaks apparently discovered that Hillary was <a href="http://endingthefed.com/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wears-diapers.html">searching online for adult diapers</a>. Maybe she currently wears them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/44-reasons-to-not-elect-hillary/">corrupt Hillary</a> continues her campaign without conducting press conferences, which is highly unusual for a US presidential candidate. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-03/hillary-promises-deliver-regular-press-conferences-one-condition">Zero Hedge</a> reports it has been 273 days (absolute zero) since her last press conference! Clearly we can deduce from this that Hillary is scared of being asked some tough questions, given how flooded she is with scandal after scandal (Clinton Foundation fraud and corruption, email deletions, foreign bribery, pay to play shenanigans, the growing <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/voting-for-hillary-clinton-body-count/">Clinton Body Count</a>, etc.). There’s nothing open and transparent about her; she’s barely holding on, keeping quiet and hoping Trump will shoot himself in the foot some more between now and November 8th.</p>

<p><strong>Clinton vs. Trump Rallies: Spot the Fakery Anyone?</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at the above images. The same thing that was happening with Bernie is happening with Trump – they have both been attracting large crowds and filling up stadiums. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign relies on several forms of fakery to give the false impression that Hillary is actually popular. They have produced blatantly photoshopped images of a Hillary rally (see below). They constantly make it look like Hillary is speaking to a large room by keeping the camera at one angle, putting bleachers or rows of people behind her, and never panning the camera around the room. They have been busted over and over for camera trickery and fakery, but unless you are tuned into the alternative media, you probably won’t see it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-photoshop-rally.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544436]" title="Entire US Presidential Election is Fake, From Start to Finish"><img src="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-photoshop-rally-300x198.jpg" alt="US presidential election Hillary's fake photoshopped rally" width="450" height="297"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;">Hillary’s fake photoshopped rally. This is a collage of images. It’s fake!</span></p>
<p><strong>Was She Even There? Hillary Takes Fakery to a New Depth</strong></p>
<p>It was somewhat stunning, even for someone as fake and fraudulent as Hillary Rodham Clinton, to release a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEkMctGrabY">video of a purported rally</a> <em>which is entirely faked </em>(embedded above). Look carefully at the video. There are at least 3 separate people holding smartphones pointed at her, yet when she finishes and exits off the stage, the images reflected in the smartphone screens are not what they should be! They show different images entirely. Was the entire rally “made up”? Is anything about this woman true at all, or are we living in a <em>Wag the Dog</em>/<em>Truman Show</em> movie set?</p>
<p><strong>Election Fraud Through Fractionalized Voting</strong></p>
<p>Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting.com has done tireless work to expose <strong>election fraud</strong> over the years. She has recently come out warning the American public of the latest technique in election rigging, which is to fractionalize votes, i.e. make them only worth a fraction (e.g. one fifth, one third, one tenth, etc.) of what they should be (one whole vote). She writes in her article <a href="http://blackboxvoting.org/fraction-magic-1/"><em>FRACTION MAGIC – PART 1: VOTES ARE BEING COUNTED AS FRACTIONS INSTEAD OF AS WHOLE NUMBERS</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The results of this study demonstrate that a fractional vote feature is embedded in each GEMS application which can be used to invisibly, yet radically, alter election outcomes by pre-setting desired vote percentages to redistribute votes. This tampering is not visible to election observers, even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer. Use of the decimalized vote feature is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures, and can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This means that with just a little computer code, someone can flip the vote and make, for example, all of the whole votes for Donald Trump suddenly worth only one quarter (0.25) instead of one (1). Vote rigging like this has already happened in the past. The system is already in place. Welcome to the USA, champion of democracy! Can you see now how other nations feel about the US enforcing democracy down the barrel of gun, when things are so utterly subverted and fake at home?</p>
<p><strong>Trump’s Connections to the Shadow Rulers</strong></p>
<p>Although this article has so far highlighted the fraud surrounding Hillary, the point here is not to support Trump. The Donald himself has a myriad of<a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/insider-trump-nwo-connections/">connections</a> and <a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/The_Donald_and_The_Deep_State/53900/0/38/38/Y/M.html">associations</a> with NWO agents such as the head of the Rockefeller CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) Tommy Haas. Trump is also close to Paypal founder, millionaire and transhumanist Peter Thiel, CIA asset and Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, as well as <a href="http://www.madcowprod.com/2016/03/17/donald-trump-dirty-money-the-filthy-rich-in-palm-beach/">Louis Lesser</a> partner of CIA Asset Meyer Lansky (who was involved the <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/jfk-assassination-who-how-why-part-1/">JFK assassination</a>). To what degree Trump is influenced or controlled by these men is an open question, however we know enough to say that he has <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/trump-2-shutdowns-muslims-internet/">tyrannical tendencies</a>, is an <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/zionist-trump-at-aipac/">ardent Zionist</a> and a possible or probable <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/trump-pedophile-lawsuit/">pedophile</a> – hardly the choice you want to be given in a free and open society.</p>
<p><strong>DHS and UN to Take Control of US Presidential Elections?</strong></p>
<p>The issues of <strong>voter fraud</strong> and <strong>election rigging</strong> have become large enough that Obama was recently asked about it. Not long after this, Jeh Johnson, the head of the DHS (Department of Homeland Security), let slip that <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/homeland-eyes-special-declaration-to-take-charge-of-elections/article/2600592">his department is considering taking control of the US presidential election</a> (problem-reaction-solution). Johnson tried to claim that elections may have become part of “critical infrastructure”. The DHS is the very same department that was created right after the <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/911-13th-anniversary-13-questions/">9/11 false flag</a> with a fast bill slammed through Congress that no-one had time to read. It’s also the same department that oversees the TSA, which gives airline passengers the choice of molestation or radiation. It’s funny how almost all governmentally-proposed solutions have the characteristic of centralizing more power in the government. Perhaps this 2016 US presidential election will be hard to rig for Hillary (given her massive unpopularity) so her controllers want more power over the election process to ensure she gets in.</p>
<p><strong>Top Conservatives and Neocons Bust the Two-Party Illusion by Openly Declaring Support for Hillary</strong></p>
<p>As if all the fakery listed above isn’t enough, consider the fact that <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-list-of-establishment-republicans-that-say-they-are-voting-for-hillary-clinton-is-staggering">many top Republicans, neocons and conservatives</a> have openly come out and stated that they would rather vote for Clinton than Trump. Why? Almost certainly because she’s more likely to start foreign wars (against China and Russia), more likely to continue the corrupt status quo and more likely to advance the New World Order agenda in line with the ambitions of these shadow rulers. Those at the top know the <strong>fake left-right paradigm</strong> is a facade designed to fool the masses into thinking they have a choice. Look at the cosy relationship between George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton, supposed opponents on opposite sides of the aisle (nothing like some CIA Mena cocaine and Satanic ritual to bond over). However, the 2016 US presidential election is unique in that it appears that some of these guys aren’t even trying to maintain the illusion of freedom.</p>
<p><strong>May 2016 be the Year the Masses Awaken to the Fakery of the US Presidential Election</strong></p>
<p>There’s enough fakery to fill a few hundreds football stadiums with this US presidential election. Hopefully we are about to see it reach a tipping point where a critical mass of people simply refuse to buy into at all. Once enough people see the “bread and circus” show for what it truly is – a distraction, a fanciful ruse, a facade and a silly game of no real consequence – they will lose confidence in the whole system and begin <a href="http://freedom-articles.toolsforfreedom.com/new-system-consciousness-not-new-president/">dreaming of new, better and fairer systems</a>. This, of course, is the worst nightmare of the NWO controllers.</p>

<p>Saudi foreign minister&#8217;s private meeting with MPs branded a &#8216;lobbying visit&#8217; amid growing evidence UK-made weapons used on Yemeni civilians</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister is to visit the UK on Wednesday to “privately” brief British MPs over concerns that Britain could start restricting arms sales to the kingdom.</p>
<p>According to a House of Commons spokesman, Adel al-Jubeir is set to meet MPs in a private meeting in Portcullis House in London, just hours before the convening of a select committee to debate whether to call for a ban on arms sales to the Saudis.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><img src="http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AP_16169593282117.jpg" alt="Saudi Arabia Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, center, arrives to speak at a news conference at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington, Friday, June 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)" width="576" height="325"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, center, is due to brief MPs in London on Wednesday.</p></div>
<p>The select committee on arms export controls meeting is also set to be held in private, but it is expected there will be a cross-party push during the meeting for the UK to suspend its multibillion-dollar arms sales to the kingdom.</p>
<p>The UK has sold billions of dollars of weapons to Saudi Arabia as it has prosecuted a war in Yemen against the Houthi movement, and amid claims UK-made weapons have been used in the indiscriminate bombing of civilians, hospitals and factories.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman from the Campaign Against the Arms Trade said the group would be staging a protest outside parliament over the meeting, which she described as a “clear lobbying visit”.</p>
<p>“They’re obviously concerned about the pressure [over arms sales],” she said, speaking to Middle East Eye.</p>
<p>The meetings will come two days after the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has defended UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia, saying the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen was not “in serious breach” of international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Johnson said a report produced by Riyadh into eight separate allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilians showed there was no such breach, which was the “key test” on deciding whether weapons sales should continue.</p>
<p>“The key test for our continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia in relation to international humanitarian law is whether those weapons might be used in a commission of a serious breach of international humanitarian law,” he said.</p>
<p>“Having regard to all the information available to us, we assess this test has not been met.”</p>
<p>During a debate in parliament on Monday, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Tobias Ellwood called on MPs critical of the Saudi campaign in Yemen to attend the meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“I invite the right hon. Gentleman to join me when the Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister comes to this place on Wednesday to address any questions that are put by parliamentarians,” he said to MP Hillary Benn in<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-09-05/debates/1609055000002/HumanitarianLaw(Yemen)#contribution-1609055000089" target="_blank">response</a> to a question over whether the government would be suspending arms sales.</p>
<blockquote><p>I will make sure, because I will be moderating the event, that he is able to put some of these questions to the Foreign Minister.</p></blockquote>
<p>In July, a Human Rights Watch report showed what was described as “<a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/british-munitions-used-against-civilians-yemen-saudi-arabia-1954296375" target="_blank">compelling evidence</a>” that British-made weapons had been used in attacks on civilians in Yemen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.caat.org.uk/" target="_blank">CAAT</a> said it would use the report as part of its court challenge against the British government to end weapons sales to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>“We’ve had 500 days of bombing, UK weapons have been used throughout – there’s been clear evidence from the beginning that they’re being used against civilian targets,” said the CAAT spokesperson.</p>
<p>CAAT earlier this year won the right to a <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-court-grants-review-weapons-sales-saudi-arabia-827016431" target="_blank">judicial review</a> of arms exports to Saudi Arabia, arguing that the British government could not guarantee UK-made weapons were not being used by Saudi Arabia against Yemeni civilians.</p>
<p>Johnson’s statement relies heavily on a report produced in Riyadh on 4 August, which investigated eight alleged attacks on Yemeni civilians, including the bombing of hospitals.</p>
<p>The report defends the bombing on the basis that the Saudis had received credible intelligence that enemy Houthi forces were in the area. In one case it offered compensation to the victims.</p>
<p>Johnson defended the cedibility of the report, saying the Saudis had “the best insight into their own procedures and will be able to conduct the most thorough and conclusive investigations”.</p>
<blockquote><p>It will also allow the coalition forces to work out what went wrong and apply the lessons learned in the best possible way. This is the standard we set ourselves and our allies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The UN last week said that at least 10,000 people have been killed in the 18-month Yemeni war.</p>

Negotiations have Failed.">Good News for the People of Europe: The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) Is Dead. Negotiations have Failed.</a></h2>
<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Peter Koenig</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>The German Minister of Economy and Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Sigmar Gabriel, a few days ago has declared that the European Union should not submit to the demands of the United States, referring to the negotiations on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investments Partnership). He said the negotiations failed. By saying so, he joined French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, as well as French Secretary of State for External Trade, Mr. Matthias Fekl.</em></p>
<p>Negotiations started in 2013. After 14 ‘rounds’ of talks dealing with 27 points, no agreement has been reached, none whatsoever, leading to the conclusion that the deal is dead. Even though Mme. Merkel defended the treaty with all her heart up to the end of July 2016, both Germany and France now request a definite end to the negotiations.</p>
<p>The collapse of the TTIP is one of the best news for Europe – and I mean the people of Europe – in recent times; an initiative of the two major players in the EU. This decision has several meanings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. European countries are gradually taking back their sovereignty from Brussels and decide for themselves what is good for them and for Europe;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. With a failed TTIP Europe escapes, or avoids, being enslaved by US corporatism, financial institutions – and US legislation;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Europe may now continue making its proper policies on socioeconomy, environment, food safety, agriculture &#8212; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Europe is now freer to pursue its own monetary policy. Under the grip of the TTIP, it would have been difficult, say impossible, to adopt a monetary policy outside of the Euro which many countries would like, openly or covertly – some without making a lot of noise for fear of being ‘reprimanded’ by Brussels.</p>
<p>The fact that authorities of both, France and Germany, stated in unison that the negotiations failed, is a sign that there is still a spirit of autonomy in Europe. What is called ‘negotiations’ were never really negotiations – a give and take between equal partners. It was from the beginning a one-way street, where the exceptional nation imposed its rules. There was no way of getting the slightest concession from them – not an iota.</p>
<p>No doubt Washington had no intention to share any of the benefits of this ‘Free Trade Agreement’ with Europe. The exceptional people wanted it all. For example, the term ‘Appelation Contrôlée’ for wine and cheese in France and other European countries, used to protect the farmers of a given region – would have disappeared. The US wanted everything to be open for the ever dictating ‘market’. Nothing was to be clearly defined, as far as Europe was concerned. No transparence &#8211; just a vast base for cheating, consumers and nations.</p>
<p>TTIP talks were held in top secret, behind closed doors. Not even politicians, let alone the public at large which eventually would have had to bear the consequences of the deal, had access to the documents being ‘negotiated’. – It showed the Machiavellian nature of empire at its best.</p>
<p>China knew very well why they were not even interested in participating in the TPP (Transpacific Partnership), a similar trade agreement with eleven Pacific nations and the US.</p>
<p>Let’s recall the key point that would have meant disaster for Europe:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- A private corporate tribunal that would have had supremacy over sovereign government legislation. For example, the tribunal could have imposed ‘sanctions’ or fines on governments, whose legislation, say for health, environmental protection and other social reasons, would have reduced corporations’ profit margins.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Similar in the banking sector, monetary policy would have been firmly dictated by the FED, Wall Street (i.e. Goldman Sachs – see Greece and the head of the ECB, a former GS exec) and the European Central Bank. This for now is still the case, but with an unsustainable and unreformable EU and Euro, both are destined to disappear sooner or later. It is likely that many countries are already quietly and clandestinely arranging for “Plan B” – preparing exit strategies. Indeed, since BREXIT, there are numerous political movements to this effect under way – and this not only in the most devastatingly affected southern European countries, but also in northern Europe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Agriculture policy would have been dictated by Washington, especially with regard to GMOs and ag-subsidies. Monsanto and the like would have had free access to all of Europe, and none of the EU members could have passed legislation prohibiting genetically modified seeds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Standards for health and nutrition would have been imposed by Washington, i.e.  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Most of these standards are considerably weaker than European equivalents, potentially exposing European citizens to greater health risks than current EU standards foresee.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Labor laws would have been weakened in according to US standards which foresee virtually no protection for workers. The Brussels imposed new labor law in France, dubbed as the &#8216;El Khomri law&#8217;, after the <em>French</em> Minister of Labor, Myriam El Khomri, would reduce significantly French labor rights, fought for and attained with decades of efforts – literally sweat and tears – by French workers and unions. The new French labor law, signed as a decree by PM Manuel Valls under a dubious special provision in the Constitution (instead of being passed through Parliament), was a precursor for things to come in the rest of Europe – had the TTIP gone forward. This controversial law is currently at the demand of more than 60 French Parliamentarians being reviewed by the French <em>Conseil d’Etat</em> (equivalent to other countries’ Supreme Court) and may quite possibly be either canceled or sent to Parliament for a decision. Now that the TTIP is dead, it is possible that the law will be repealed.</p>
<p>The day the TTIP died was a great day for Europe. Although Europe is far from being out of the woods. Her own problems keep piling up, many of them also a direct or indirect consequence of empire.</p>
<p>To mention just a few –</p>
<ul>
<li>immigration from US-NATO war-destroyed countries;</li>
<li>the never ending financial <em>cum</em> economic crisis;</li>
<li>the complete absence of solidarity among EU nations;</li>
<li>the lack of EU countries’ sovereignty; the missing EU Constitution giving member countries a common perspective and political agenda;</li>
<li>the increasing (‘false flag’) terror attacks throughout Europe; – and not least NATO – which through its aggression towards Russia is increasingly becoming a risk of war &#8211; of WWIII – that would for the third time in 100 years devastate Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time the rest of the world would very likely not be spared. Many countries are conscious of this danger and would like to get out of NATO, but don’t dare say so, because of fear from the boots of Washington.</p>
<p>Let’s hope the death of the TTIP will bring a new breeze of fresh air and ideas into European sovereignty.</p>

<div class="content">
<p><em>WTC Building exploding into fine dust (it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> burning down) by pre-planted explosives in an obvious controlled demolition. </em></p>
<p><em>The arrow points to a “squib” of exploding gas which is commonly seen with controlled demolitions. Some of the “splinters” seen (the only solid objects that did not pulverize into dust) are actually chunks of steel beams that were being exploded upward and laterally. The nicely-sectioned steel beams and girders were soon ordered by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to be trucked away and shipped to China – an order that constitutes disturbing a crime scene – which is a federal crime.</em></p>
<p>I just received the latest PBS (Public Broadcasting System) monthly schedule for September and discovered that PBS’s newest documentary, entitled “9/11: Inside the Pentagon” will be broad-casting and the re-broadcasting the program a total of 8 times over the week surrounding 9/11/16!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/9-11-explosion.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544414]" title="9-11 explosion"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5544419" title="9-11 explosion" src="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/9-11-explosion.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="480"/></a></p>
<p>I tried but was unable to view the documentary in its entirety online, but in the trailer there was breathless, tear-jerking testimony from several of the Pentagon employees that survived the professed crash of Flight 77.</p>
<p>However, researchers and true investigative reporters have long known that it wasn’t flight 77 that hit the Pentagon that day, since the damage to the various walls of the Pentagon could only have been done by a much smaller aircraft, such as a missile (or perhaps a $222, 000,000 USAF Global Hawk surveillance drone). Also there was no evidence of debris from the aluminum body, wings and tail section of a 100 ton Boeing 757.</p>
<p>The only so-called evidence for Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon that the DOD eventually produced were five ridiculously unconvincing and obviously photo-shopped images that supposedly showed a plane in one frame and fiery explosions in three of the frames. (For information on the crime and cover-up at the Pentagon and a detailed expose of the infamous, obviously doctored still pictures that, interestingly, were dated 9/12/01, 17:37 (5:37 pm) rather than 9/11/01, 9:37 (9:37 am)  the actual time of the hit), go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/pentagon/what-hit-it.htm">http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/pentagon/what-hit-it.htm</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5544420" title="pentagon 9-11" src="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pentagon-9-11.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="312"/></p>
<p><a href="https://voiceofpeopletoday.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/finally-new-cnn-911-video-shows-no-plane-hit-the-pentagon.jpg?w=614">https://voiceofpeopletoday.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/finally-new-cnn-911-video-shows-no-plane-hit-the-pentagon.jpg?w=614</a></p>
<p>And of course there was no plane debris from a 100 ton plane lying around outside of the  re-enforced concrete walls at the Pentagon. There are no indestructible titanium jet engines, no luggage, no passenger seats, no indestructible black boxes and no passenger body parts that <em>always</em> litter the scene of passenger plane crashes.</p>
<p>If you aren’t smelling a rat by now, you’re not paying attention. Don’t expect PBS to raise any uncomfortable questions about 9/11 in their documentary.</p>
<p>Sadly, NPR, MPR and WPR – my usually respected regional public radio stations (that regularly ask me for money) &#8211; have resolutely refused to interview any of the multitude of scientists, researchers, scholars and authors who have amassed mountains of court-of-law-ready evidence that 9/11 was a criminal false flag operation. All the evidence points to it being an inside job.</p>
<p>The unwelcome, provable facts documenting the conspiracies and the subsequent cover-ups (that are conspiracy theories no longer) thatreally happened on 9/11/01 is obviously a taboo subject that the mainstream media is terrified of, even among the many supposedly trustworthy investigative journalists that are on the staffs of those stations. They apparently have received orders from above to censor the truth, are afraid of losing their jobs or for some other reason can’t handle the truth.</p>
<p>Similarly, the usually-honorable PBS seems to keep subtly mis-informing its viewers with various slanted Frontline documentaries that, for just one example, has promoted the alleged safety and efficacy of Big Pharma’s toxic drugs and Big Vaccine’s neurotoxic and autoimmunity-inducing infant vaccines. It also has continued accepting the sponsorship of NOVA from David Koch and then squashed an expose of the nefarious agendas of the Koch Brothers.</p>
<p>PBS has never screened any of the multitudes of powerful and irrefutable 9/11 Truth documentaries that are already out there (see a list of my personal best ones further below). And now, with the Pentagon on 9/11, PBS has produced what looks like another human interest pablum puff piece that will certainly get most undiscerning PBS viewers to look the other way.</p>
<p><strong>And they are showing it EIGHT TIMES IN ONE WEEK! Outrageous!</strong></p>
<p>But readers should be reminded about the fact that those who willingly and knowingly cover-up crimes are themselves guilty of criminal conduct, and they can be prosecuted. Most people regard the horrendous events of 9/11/01 as the Crime of the Century; so those who knowingly cover up those crimes are technically guilty of crimes themselves. Should that standard apply to editors and publishers (and their reporters) of the TV, radio and print media outlets that inform us (or mis-inform or dis-inform us)? I think so.</p>
<p>And, despite their supposed crime-fighting reputation, the FBI collaborated in – and covered-up the Crime at the Pentagon by almost instantaneously confiscating private video surveillance cameras from nearby businesses. And the Pentagon never released the evidence that would have proved or disproved what many eyewitnesses observed: that no commercial jet hit the Pentagon on 9/11/01. (If the videos had actually showed an airliner, the Cheney/Bush administration would surely have flaunted those videos.) .</p>
<p>So the Cover-up of the Crime of the Century (a prosecutable offense) continues, and PBS and NPR (and every other corporate-controlled mainstream media outlet that one can think of) could be prosecuted for their parts in the cover-up because of their decisions to withhold vital information from the public and the American taxpayers.</p>
<p>But what bothers me the most is that most of the soon-to-vote young adults (that were infants, toddlers or naïve children back in 2001) may never have had the opportunity to see the evidence that implicates their own government, their own politicians, their own FBI, their own CIA and their own DOD in the Crime AND/OR the Cover-up. What is needed is complete transparency.</p>
<p>And so a sizable proportion of a new generation of manipulated and brain-washed Americans are  unaware that its nation’s perpetual war agenda and the diabolical military and economic destabilizations of weaker nations around the world is actually understandable if one understands what really happened on 9/11.</p>
<p>9/11 was the justification for 1) stupidly invading Afghanistan and Iraq. 9/11 was also the justification for 2) the formation of the Gestapo-like Department of Homeland Security and the new 3) Surveillance State, both of which have gutted the Constitution. Without the orchestrated events of 9/11, the 4) controversial Patriot Act [as well as 5) every National Defense Authorization Act since then] and the 6) perpetual, enemy-producing ever-lasting “War on Terror” would not be realities. Without coming clean about the truth of 9/11, neither the nation’s credibility nor the planet can be sustained.</p>
<p>Powerful media-perpetrated Big Lie propaganda has justified in the minds of most citizens the corrupt Cheney/Bush administration claims that the “attacks” were orchestrated by Osama bin Laden and not by our own Crony Capitalist system that worships at the alters of Mammon and Mars.</p>
<p>The evidence for the above assertions is overwhelming and is easily available for confirmation for anybody with internet access and the ability to overcome their blind patriotism, their cognitive dissonance and their willingness to courageously search for the truth. My colleagues in the 9/11 Truth community only hopes for an honest appraisal of the established facts and that readers will start reading between the lines and start thinking critically.</p>
<h2>Twenty-six<strong> Questions That Deceived Americans Need to ask  </strong></h2>
<p>From: <a href="http://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com/node/7785">http://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com/node/7785</a><strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>1) Did you know that</em></strong> a third World Trade Center high-rise building also fell on September 11th? WTC Building 7 was a 47-storey, steel-framed skyscraper located a full block away from the Twin Towers and it was not even hit by any plane. Nonetheless, it fell at near free-fall speed straight down into its own footprint at 5:20 p.m. that afternoon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>2) Did you know that</em></strong> the owner of Building 7, Larry Silverstein, said &#8220;We’ve had such a terrible loss of life that maybe the smartest thing to do is “pull it” [Building 7] and they made that decision – to pull – and then we watched the building collapse&#8221;? And yet <em>The 9/11 Commission Report</em> never mentioned a thing about Building 7 [“Pull” is an industry term for using controlled demolition.]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>3) Did you know that</em></strong> “Lucky” Larry Silverstein was awarded 4.68 billion dollars in insurance claims for the Twin Towers which he had just leased six weeks before 9/11 from the Port Authority of New York. The Port Authority had previously declined to spend the multi million dollars necessary to remove the <strong>asbestos</strong> and bring the Towers up to code required by law?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>4) Did you know that</em></strong> – in the history of architecture &#8211; fire has never caused any steel-frame building to collapse, except on 9/11 when three skyscrapers fell at near free-fall speeds despite the fact that there were scores of massive steel columns in the core of each of the Twin Towers?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>5) Did you know that</em></strong> almost every one of the WTC steel beams and girders were quickly shipped overseas – before any independent investigation – and melted down? (This is unprecedented and contrary to federal crime scene laws, making Rudy Giuliani indictable for those federal crimes.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>6) Did you know that</em></strong> fighter jets routinely are scrambled the minute any airplane loses contact with the FAA or deviates from its flight path and the jets usually only take 20 minutes to get in the air?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>7) Did you know that</em></strong> in the nine months preceding 9/11 there were 67 jet fighter scrambles of wayward airplanes and that on average 100 intercepts occur each year?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>8) Did you know that</em></strong> the Secret Service broke established protocols by allowing President Bush to remain in a well-publicized classroom photo op for at least 8 minutes after it was revealed to him that &#8220;America was under attack&#8221; (when Andy Card informed him that the second plane had hit the second tower)?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>9) Did you know that</em></strong> the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has never revealed the unidentified traders who made millions of dollars in profits by short-selling the stocks of American and United airlines that were impacted by the attacks?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>10) Did you know that</em></strong> there were countless warnings of &#8220;impending terrorist attacks&#8221; from at least 11 countries prior to 9/11 and that the threat level for such an attack was ‘blinking red’ according to the Director of the CIA George Tenet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>11) Did you know that</em></strong> Attorney General John Ashcroft, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, author Salmon Rushdie and (according to <em>Newsweek</em>) a group of high-ranking generals at the Pentagon were warned not to fly on 9/11 but never revealed who told them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>12) Did you know that</em></strong> in September of 2000 a NeoConservative group of Republicans known as The Project for A New American Century (PNAC, many of whom would become key officials in the Bush administration the next year) wrote that their proposed massive military buildup would proceed slowly &#8220;absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor&#8221;?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>13) Did you know that</em></strong> at least 6 of the alleged 9/11 hijackers were reported to be still alive according to BBC and UK print media reports in the weeks following 9/11?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>14) Did you know that</em></strong> the FBI has said that there is no evidence to link Osama bin Laden to 9/11 and that Osama was never wanted for the crime of 9/11 on its <em>Ten Most Wanted Fugitives </em>list?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>15) Did you know that </em></strong>the leading scholar of Osama bin Laden (Bruce Lawrence) stated that the December 2001 confession tape, which the Bush White House flaunted, was a fake?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>16) Did you know that</em></strong> Secretary of State Colin Powell promised a White Paper proving that Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda were responsible for 9/11 back in 2001 – but never produced it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>17) Did you know that</em></strong> the Bush administration resisted the formation of the 9/11 Commission for 441 days? Or that similar investigations, such as those for Pearl Harbor, the JFK assassination and the space shuttle disasters, all started within one week?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>18) Did you know that</em></strong> &#8221;The Jersey Girls&#8221; – four courageous 9/11 widows – finally forced the 9/11 Commission into existence and presented many questions, 70% of which were ignored? Or that under the leadership of Bush administration insider, Philip Zelikow, the final report failed to address any of the evidence pointing to official complicity? (And the 9/11 Commission Report never said word one about WTC 7?)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>19) Did you know that</em></strong> no official agency (the FAA, FBI or the airlines) has ever released a list of the 9/11 passengers &#8211; including the names of the supposed hijackers, but within hours after the attacks, the FBI unbelievably released a definitive list of the 19 so-called hijackers?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>20) Did you know that</em></strong> multiple air defense drills (war games) were planned for the morning of 9/11 and that these exercises left only a few pairs of fighter jets available to protect the entire North East Air Defense Sector of the United States leaving Washington and NYC vulnerable to an attack?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>21) Did you know that</em></strong> there was no visible airplane debris where Flight 93 supposedly crashed near Shanksville, PA. There was only a small smoking hole in the ground, much like a bomb crater, with a pile of planted scrap metal, but that there was debris from the aircraft found 8 miles away at New Baltimore? And that Shanksville Mayor Ernie Stull said three different times in an interview (for a 2003 German documentary) that there was &#8220;no airplane&#8221;?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>22) Did you know that</em></strong> office furniture burns at low temperatures of 600 to 800°F, and that jet fuel (kerosene), an ordinary hydrocarbon, has a maximum burning temperature of 1200°F, but that steel doesn’t start melting until temperatures reach 2750°F?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>23) Did you know that</em></strong> tests have shown that cellphone calls – back in 2001 – could not have been made at altitudes over 8,000 feet for any meaningful duration and that, more significantly, United Airlines Flight 93 was proven to be 35,000 to 40,000 feet when calls were said to have been made?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>24) Did you know that</em></strong> bombs went off in the North Tower in the sub-basement a few seconds before the first plane hit &#8211; according to Willie Rodriguez, a janitor who became known as <em>the last man out</em> and who was awarded a medal by President Bush for his bravery in rescuing dozens of people from the North Tower before it collapsed? Rodriguez testified that he and fellow workers heard multiple explosions coming from various locations in the floors above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>25) Did you know that</em></strong> alleged hijacker Hani Hanjour was known as an incompetent pilot to his trainers and yet he supposedly pulled off an unprecedented 270° turn at 500 mph, diving 7,000 feet in less than 3 minutes? And then supposedly crashed Flight 77 into the least populated, most reinforced section of the Pentagon?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>26) Did you know that</em></strong> the mainstream media (MSM) in the US is owned and controlled by five or six major corporate conglomerates and that there has been very limited and sporadic coverage of alternative views about 9/11? Any time the issue of 9/11 is raised, the MSM accuses the questioner of being a conspiracy theorist or even a traitor.</p>

<p><em>A regional summit of the heads-of-state of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was held in late August in Mbabane, Swaziland. This was the 36<sup>th</sup> annual gathering of the organization which was founded in 1980.</em></p>
<p>King Mswati III was elected as the leader of the regional grouping which consists of 15 member-states. South African President Jacob Zuma was chosen as rotating chair and  the governments of Tanzania and Angola were also elected to the rotating posts of chair and vice chair, respectively, of the SADC organs of co-operation in the domains of politics, defense and security.</p>
<p>This summit approved measures dealing with greater co-operation in the financial markets sector. Other actions consisted of amendments to article 3 of the protocol on commercial exchange in SADC, the accord on the materialization of the Regional Development Fund, as well as the draft agreement that amends the SADC protocol on gender and development.</p>

<p>Southern Africa is facing numerous difficulties in the present period with the region experiencing the worst drought in several decades. The lack of adequate water resources has resulted in power outages, a shortage of foreign exchange revenue and a decline in agricultural production.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that 27 million people, approximately nine percent of the sub-continental population, are food insecure as a result of the decline in the performance of the 2015-16 farming season. The El Niño-induced drought in the region is the worst in three-and-a-half decades.</p>
<p>The regional drought response team has developed an appeal for international assistance.  SADC outgoing chairperson, President Ian Khama of Botswana, initiated the appeal to the tune of $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>According to the official website of the Southern African grouping, “The SADC region is experiencing a devastating drought episode associated with the 2015/2016 El Niño event which is negatively affecting livelihoods and the quality of lives across the region. Four Member States have already declared national drought emergencies (Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe). South Africa has declared a drought emergency in 7 of the country’s 9 provinces.” (SADC.int)</p>
<p>This same report goes on to note that, “Mozambique declared a 90-day institutional red alert for some southern and central areas. Member States are currently conducting their annual vulnerability assessments and results were expected in early June 2016. These results will provide the effect of drought on food and nutrition security and vulnerability situation as a whole.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the summit was held under the theme, ‘Resource Mobilization for Investment in Sustainable Energy Infrastructure for an Inclusive SADC Industrialization for the Prosperity of the Region’. Prior to the convening of the heads-of-state summit the Council of Ministers received reports on the progress towards the implementation of the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP). The report focused specifically on the 2016-2017 Action Plans which reviewed the implementation of decisions agreed upon since March 2016.</p>
<p>Council members heard analyses on the political and economic development in the region, along with the implementation of programs aimed at regional co-operation and integration, continental integration and co-operation, among others issues.</p>
<p><strong>Election of Swazi King Spurs Controversy</strong></p>
<p>With the ascendancy of King Mswati III as the SADC chair, a flurry of criticism was launched over the decision. Swaziland is a monarchy that has been accused of thwarting democratic practice.</p>
<p>The King has denied these allegations saying that the small landlocked state of 1.2 million is a democracy although the prime minister and government are chosen by the monarch.</p>
<p>Opposition parties in neighboring Botswana, whose government relinquished the SADC chair to Swaziland, said this “is a matter on great concern to us,&#8221; according to Vice President of the Botswana Congress Party Kesitegile Gobotswang who was quoted in the Botswana Guardian stressing, &#8220;the country [Swaziland] has thus far refused to embrace the values of democracy. This is an indication that the regional body [SADC] is not committed to democratic values.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Mswati does not qualify to hold that position at all &#8230; he is a corrupt leader who sees nothing wrong with abusing public resources while people starve,&#8221; added President of the Botswana People&#8217;s Party, Motlatsi Malapis. (Swazi Media Commentary, Aug. 17)</p>
<p><strong>Other Regional Problems of Instability</strong></p>
<p>Three other major states in the region have been the focus of economic and political problems over the last several months. In Zimbabwe, a coalition of 18 oppositional political parties known as the National Electoral Reform Agenda (NERA), have called for the resignation of the democratically-elected government of President Robert Mugabe, the First Secretary of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriot Front (ZANU-PF).</p>
<p>Violent unrest erupted in late August when protesters in the capital of Harare threw stones at police, set fire to police vehicles and looted stores. Zimbabwe has been subjected to over fifteen years of economic sanctions by Britain, the United States, European Union (EU) and other imperialist states. The opposition parties are blaming the current economic crisis exclusively on the ruling ZANU-PF party ignoring the role of sanctions and deliberate destabilization tactics carried out against the government by western countries.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) is dealing with the most formidable challenge to its rule since the transition to national independence and democracy in 1994. Impacted by the drought and the decline in commodity prices prompting a drop in the values of the rand and investment bonds, the center-right opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party and the supposed ultra-left Economic Freedom Fighters have teamed up to attack the ANC preventing the ruling organization from securing majorities in several key municipalities including Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay.</p>
<p>The ANC is also dealing with internal criticism and disaffection as elements within the party are calling for the holding of an elective conference to discuss the possibility replacing President Jacob Zuma and the National Executive Committee (NEC). A demonstration led by the ANC Youth League on September 5 attempted to deliver a memorandum to Secretary General Gwede Mantashe. The small group was prevented from getting near the entrance of Luthuli House by members of the Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) who vowed to defend the Zuma government at all costs.</p>
<p>Eventually Mantashe surrounded by military-clad veterans accepted the memorandum from the demonstrators. Mantashe said the process was reflective of the internal democracy inside the party while other suggested it revealed an organization in crisis.</p>
<p>Also at the recently-held 7<sup>th</sup> Congress of the ruling MPLA-Workers Party of Angola in Luanda, a wide-ranging discussion on the economic crisis took place. President Eduardo dos Santos was re-elected as party leader while in the aftermath of the gathering, the finance minister was removed from this portfolio within the government.</p>
<p>Quartz news agency said of the current economic situation inside the oil-producing state which won its national independence through a protracted armed struggle and civil war waged against U.S.-backed interests, that “Angola’s president José Eduardo dos Santos has fired the country’s finance minister, according to a statement from the government. Dos Santos gave no explanation for his Sept. 5 replacement of Armando Manuel with Archer Mangueira, the head of Angola’s Capital Markets Commission, according to Reuters.” (Sept. 6)</p>
<p>This publication reported as well saying “Manuel was appointed in 2013, just before the oil price tanked, and since then he has presided over an economy battered by weakened oil exports. Angolan newspapers have reported that Manuel’s replacement is directly linked to the country’s stalled talks with the International Monetary Fund over medium-term emergency funding. Mangueira, also known as Augusto Archer de Sousa Hose, was recently elected to the ruling MPLA’s central committee, bringing him closer into dos Santos’s political inner circle. He is also a familiar face to international investors.”</p>
<p>These developments in Southern Africa point to the necessity of closer regional integration and economic independence from the western industrialized states which have trimmed down considerably their trade in oil and other resources with the 15-member body. Until alternative sources of economic generation and vitality can be developed SADC will be plagued by further uncertainty and political instability.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Dr. Binoy Kampmark</p>

<div class="content">
<p><em>The question is: was a woman who preached virtue in suffering rather than trying to alleviate it and took money from dictators really that saintly at all? </em><em>Douglas Robertson, The Independent, Sep 5, 2016</em></p>
<p>In looking at the antics surrounding saintliness, George Orwell’s remarks about the important presumption of sinning is all important.  It is axiomatic that all saints be presumed sinners. The greater they are in achievement, heavy in the miracles department and achievement, the less likely they are to be the purest of pure.</p>
<p>The story of Mother Teresa of Kolkata is a story of how a modern saint is cultivated and made.  The Catholic Church, for all its ceremonial weight and stuffy ritual, has always been, in one sense, modern.  Modern to corporate practice; modern to innovative methods of generating wealth; and novel for creating cohorts of public relations promoters known as saints.</p>
<p>The latest addition comes in the form of Mother Teresa, who was canonised on September 4.  On being beatified, thereby being given the title of Blessed, the pathway to sainthood was assured. In doing so, the Church succumbed, according to the late Christopher Hitchens, “to the forces of showbiz, superstition, and populism.”[1]</p>
<p>Ever wishing to give a sense of incorporating even dissenters, the Church went so far as to ask Hitchens to play Devil’s Advocate.  Naturally, the role of <em>advocatus diaboli</em> was itself pure show, necessary procedural pomp for an assured outcome.  The MT train was chuffing inexorably to final canonisation.</p>
<p>The congenial, even admiring throngs of the notable and unknown have added voices over the years to the Mother Teresa cult.  Much of it began with the grovelling tribute of a previously sharp man of letters Malcolm Muggeridge, who found in the Kolkata figure a creature of unquestioned virtue.</p>
<p>In <em>Something Beautiful for God</em> (1971), Muggers gushingly suggested that, “the wholly dedicated like Mother Teresa do not have biographies.  Biographically speaking, nothing happens to them.  To live for, and in, others, as she and the Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity do is to eliminate happenings, which are a factor of the ego and the will.”</p>
<p>While admitting to not being “enamoured with the idea of sainthood,” former volunteer Mari Marcel Thekaekara would still say that she “took dying people off the Kolkata streets.  No one else does that.”[2]  True, if only for a grander purpose in mind, all ego, and all will.</p>
<p>Thekaekara provides some insight, being one of the Catholic children who volunteered at the orphanage Shishu Bhavan.  Mother Theresa the autocrat permanently loomed; respect for elders instilled; religious fervour upheld.  Controls were decreed everywhere, from the frequency of nuns writing home, to the consumption of juice in the stifling heat.</p>
<p>There was anger at her techniques, her Christian apologias about poverty, her infuriating straightjacket tyranny.  For all that, people were still brought “off filthy pavements” and allowed to “die in dignity.”</p>
<p>Hitchens famously thought otherwise.  This “lying, thieving Albanian dwarf” wangled her way into the corridors of power, be they hypocritical evangelicals in the United States or Third World dictators.  It did not matter where the money came from.</p>
<p>As Douglas Robertson explained in <em>The Independent</em> (Sep 5), Mother Teresa “was a celebrity, with a very well managed brand.” It was a brand that took the most reactionary views of the Church out of the doctrinaire closet and onto the streets, coupled with an unmatched capacity for fund raising through the Missionaries of Charity.</p>
<p>She damned contraception as wounding to husband and wife, an act of selfishness that retarded the natural processes of procreation. Shagging had to lead to having.  “This turns to self and so destroys the gift of love in him or her.” She condemned abortion: “If a mother can kill her own child, then what is left of the West to be destroyed?”</p>
<p>Shaming leaders with sanctimonious authority, she would use poverty as her own whip of justification, her own alibi for existence. It mattered that people were poor because this provided some sense of grace – and naturally, a vital role for religious instruction. They were to suffer “like Christ’s passion.” Truly, a sadist in faith’s true employ.</p>
<p>Bone racking, debilitating suffering was solid gold to Mother Teresa, and could only ever be the logical outcome of a faith that insists on suffering in order to be saved.  Naturally, she thrived in an environment where misery and poverty were of such levels, and of such depth.  Jesus was truly overspending his time kissing everybody.</p>
<p>The cult of sainthood; Jesus lending his lips in repeated acts of generosity; the machine of publicity best seen in the cult of saints.  Mother Teresa can now count herself in that company, with her biography well and truly crafted, ego and will acknowledged.</p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Joseph Santolan</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte seized upon the pretext provided by a bomb blast in a marketplace in the southern city of Davao Friday night to announce a nationwide “state of lawlessness.” The declaration is a significant step toward the formal declaration of martial law.</em></p>
<p>The bomb, which was set off in Roxas Night Market in Davao, killed 15 people and injured at least 71. Duterte, who was in Davao at the time, appeared at the bombing site at four in the morning and announced to the press that he had placed Davao city under military lock-down and that he was declaring a nationwide “state of lawlessness.”</p>
<p>While stating that this was “not martial law,” Duterte told the press that the military would be “running the country.” He stated, “I am inviting now the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the military and the police to run the country in accordance with my specifications.” Military checkpoints would be set up throughout country, and the military and police would be authorized to conduct searches without warrants of vehicles and persons. Curfews might also be imposed throughout the country.</p>
<p>Duterte then told the media that he had been forewarned that the bombing would take place. He stated that this was why all of his military and police commanders, as well as intelligence heads, were already on the scene in Davao.</p>
<p>He was not able to prevent the bombing because “the Philippines is not a fascist state … It is unfortunate that this is a democracy and we cannot frisk anybody for just any reason.” He repeated this point later in his press conference, “Unfortunately we cannot stop people because that would be fascistic. That is the price of being a democratic state.”</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana issued a similar statement to the press, claiming that “the enemy” is “adept at using the democratic space granted by our Constitution to move around freely and unimpeded to sow terror.”</p>
<p>Duterte is openly stating his desire for a police state, if not fascism. According to him, democracy is a problem that must be remedied through direct police/military rule.</p>
<p>Duterte stated that the “state of lawlessness” would last as long he deemed that there was a threat of terrorism or “drug violence.” He cited the epidemic of vigilante killings, for which he is directly responsible by openly encouraging these murders, as a justification for his declaration.</p>
<p>Duterte’s declaration of a “state of lawlessness,” and his calling for the military to “run the country,” was a carefully planned event. Sal Panelo, the official legal counsel of the president, told the press over the weekend that the president had prepared the declaration long before the bombing as part of his campaign against alleged drug criminals. The bombing merely provided a convenient pretext.</p>
<p>The initial police suspect for the bombing is the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). Operating in the Sulu archipelago, the Abu Sayyaf is a terrorist organization with approximately 200 members. Its activities consist of kidnap-for-ransom, beheadings of hostages, and occasional bombings.</p>
<p>The ASG was created in the early 1990s by Islamist elements returning to the Philippines from Afghanistan, where they had been part of the CIA’s secret war against the Soviet-backed regime. With assistance from then President Cory Aquino, the ASG was created to foment division between the larger Muslim secessionist organizations, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).</p>
<p>Over the past 25 years, the ASG has provided the pretext for repeated US military interventions and for the increased militarization of the Philippine state.</p>
<p>The ASG issued a press statement over the weekend denying that they had been involved in the Davao bombing and claiming that a new breakaway group, Daulat Ul Islamiya, had been responsible.</p>
<p>The declaration of a “state of lawlessness” will be used to directly incorporate the military into Duterte’s murderous anti-drug crusade, which has thus far been carried out by the police and vigilantes.</p>
<p>As of September 1, the official death toll from this campaign, which targets the most impoverished layers of the population, was 2,446 in the first two months of the Duterte administration. Of this number, 929 were killed by the police, and 1,507 by vigilantes.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, the scholarly consensus on Martial Law under the Marcos dictatorship estimates that 3,257 people were killed by state forces from 1972 to the early 1980s. If the current body count continues, Duterte will pass this figure by early October, as he completes his third month in office.</p>
<p>The vigilante killings are being carried out with the direct sanction and encouragement of the Duterte administration. An account published by BBC on August 26 revealed that at least some of the vigilante hit squads are operating on direct orders from local police and are being paid by the police for each of their victims.</p>
<p>Duterte openly sanctioned the hiring of hit squads during his Saturday press conference. He called for the hiring of “mercenaries,” saying, “There’s no other option. These people are like germs, which must be eliminated.”</p>
<p>Business investors and international finance capital continue to enthusiastically endorse Duterte’s dictatorial measures. Guenter Taus, chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines (ECCP), told the press that what was needed—just as in “Brussels and Paris”—was a “transparent and obvious severe increase of military and police presence everywhere.” ECCP spokesperson Henry Schumacher told Reuters two weeks ago that investment would flow into the Philippines because “an iron fist is going to be behind it.”</p>
<p>Washington has funded Duterte’s death squads, with Secretary of State John Kerry supplying $32 million to support the anti-drug campaign. Whether Washington continues to support Duterte’s fascistic policies depends entirely on whether he toes their line in the South China Sea. Washington is looking for Duterte to aggressively assert Philippine claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea using the ruling against China by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague.</p>
<p>Duterte has thus far attempted to pursue a conciliatory foreign policy toward Beijing, looking to secure increased trade ties with China. Washington has begun raising the specter of “human rights” against Duterte as a means of applying pressure.</p>
<p>Duterte will be meeting with President Obama in Laos this week during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit. He has begun to signal that he will adopt a more oppositional stance toward China as a means of securing Washington’s continued backing.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Duterte summoned the Chinese ambassador demanding to know why Chinese vessels were operating in the disputed Scarborough shoal, which the PCA had ruled was not Chinese territory. Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay stated, “China will be the ‘loser’ if it does not recognize an international court ruling against its territorial claims in the South China Sea. We are trying to make China understand especially when the dust settles that unless they respect and recognize the arbitral tribunal, they will be the losers at the end of the day on this matter.”</p>
<p><strong>If Duterte demonstrates that he will serve the interests of Washington in their drive to war against China, Washington will drop all concerns about “human rights.” They will back a Duterte dictatorship just as fully as they did the martial law regime of Ferdinand Marcos.</strong></p>

<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Chaim Kupferberg</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>This article was first published by Global Research on June 13, 2002. You can access the original archive <a href="http://globalresearch.ca/articles/KUP206A.html">here</a>. </em></p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the destruction of the World Trade Center, the finger of guilt was directed toward the only plausible author for such a sophisticated and ruthless act of terror &#8211; Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>Throughout the late &#8217;90&#8242;s, we were informed that bin Laden had declared war on America by reason of the American military presence on Saudi soil in the wake of the Persian Gulf War. We were told how bin Laden, ensconced in Afghanistan, headed up a world-wide terror franchise whose sophistication and global reach dwarfed that of the Iranian-financed Hizballah or Islamic Jihad (previously, the most widely known of the terror organizations among the masses in the Middle East). Bin Laden&#8217;s organization, al-Qaida, was presented to us as something entirely new in the annals of terrorism &#8211; a far-flung, sophisticated empire of terror, possessing &#8211; possibly &#8211; weapons of mass destruction, while having no clear or viable state sponsor behind it (as the Afghani Taliban were merely its resident protectors).  In short, by September 11, the United States now had a bona fide enemy &#8211; and, as they say in criminal justice parlance, a suspect with motive, means, and opportunity.</p>
<p>And while I was a bit taken at how quickly &#8211; and confidently &#8211; the fingers were pointing only hours after the 9/11 bombings, I was positively shaken by the first red flag that popped up. His name was John O&#8217;Neill &#8211; or more precisely, he is the seam that shows. Dated September 12, in a Washington Post article by Vernon Loeb, it was revealed that O&#8217;Neill, who died in his capacity as head of security for the World Trade Center, was also formerly the New York FBI Counterterror chief responsible for the investigation into Osama bin Laden. That could perhaps be written off as one of those freak synchronicities. There were the other items &#8211; reported quite blandly, in that &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing to see here, folks&#8221; tone &#8211; that gave me that sinking feeling. Apparently, O&#8217;Neill had a falling-out with the Ambassador to Yemen over his investigative style and was banned from returning there. But then there was that other nugget that I had trouble digesting &#8211; that O&#8217;Neill had resigned from a thirty-year career in the FBI &#8220;under a cloud&#8221; over an incident in Tampa &#8211; and then left to take up the security position at the WTC (only two weeks before!).</p>
<p>The seam that shows&#8230;</p>
<p>For the bulk of his career, like most of his FBI colleagues, John O&#8217;Neill was largely unknown to the public at large &#8211; respected in his circle, to be sure, yet scarcely meriting much mention in the media &#8211; beyond being referenced now and then as an expert on counterterrorism. Yet in the few months leading up to September 11, O&#8217;Neill was now suddenly the subject of a series of seemingly unrelated controversies &#8211; the first, in July, involving his dispute with the State Department over the conduct of the bin Laden investigation in Yemen; and the second, in August, in which he was reported to be under an FBI probe for misplacing a briefcase of classified documents during an FBI convention in Tampa.</p>
<p>In the light of the aftermath of this second controversy &#8211; the documents were found, &#8220;untouched&#8221;, a few hours later &#8211; one wonders why this seemingly minor news would merit such lengthy coverage in the Washington Post and New York Times. Keeping in mind the fact that these latter articles on O&#8217;Neill appeared a mere three weeks before he was to die in the rubble of the Twin Towers, one wonders if this wasn&#8217;t a well-orchestrated smear campaign against O&#8217;Neill, with a bit of unintended &#8220;blowback&#8221; &#8211; as this now-discredited counterterror chief in charge of all bin Laden bombings would finally make the news as a fatal casualty of bin Laden&#8217;s final bombing. Coincidence? Or was there something more here that would bear investigating?</p>
<p>My gut told me that, in the months preceding September 11, somebody was out to either discredit John O&#8217;Neill or, alternatively, to plant disinformation that could later be used to divert any investigator from a fruitful reconstruction of the forces behind 9/11.  Or, quite possibly, was a mistake made &#8211; one pointing the way toward a plan whose scope goes well beyond the designs of Osama bin Laden? In other words, could we spot the telltale fingerprints of a propaganda campaign preceding 9/11?</p>
<p>Well, as they say, a hypothesis is only as good as its usefulness in ferreting out reality. My hypothesis: that the events of September 11 were planned by those who not only had the motive, means, and opportunity to carry out the plan, but also were best placed to manage the consequences stemming from it, as well as managing the flow of information. If this were an &#8220;inside job&#8221;, the first thing to do was to look at who conveyed specific information on bin Laden before &#8211; and I stress, before &#8211; 9/11, for they were most likely involved wittingly or not with those who masterminded it.</p>
<p>Virtually the first &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; was presented the day after 9/11, when Vernon Loeb and Dan Eggen reported in the Post that Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the Al-Quds al Arabi newspaper in London, &#8220;received information that he [bin Laden] planned very, very big attacks against American interests&#8221; only three weeks before 9/11. Moreover, the article reported that Atwan &#8220;was convinced that Islamic fundamentalists aligned with bin Laden were &#8216;almost certainly&#8217; behind the attacks.&#8221; Incidentally, Atwan had personally interviewed bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1996 &#8211; among the very few to do so. As reported by Michael Evans in the August 24, 1998 issue of The Times, Atwan &#8220;is trusted by bin Laden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curious, perhaps, that Atwan seemed to be one of the major &#8220;point men&#8221; used in elaborating the Osama bin Laden &#8220;legend&#8221;, as they say in intelligence parlance. In a U.S. News article dated August 31, 1998, Atwan informs us that bin Laden &#8220;is a humble man who lives simply, eating fried eggs, tasteless low-fat cheese, and bread gritty with sand. He hates America.&#8221; No flash in the pan, this interviewer. Apparently, bin Laden kept Atwan&#8217;s business card tucked away in his toga pocket. &#8220;Bin Laden phoned this newspaper, phoned me last Friday,&#8221; Atwan revealed in an ABC News LateLine Transcript dated August 25, 1998. We&#8217;ll come back to ABC News shortly.</p>
<p>While solidly implicating bin Laden the day after 9/11, Atwan was also the media&#8217;s &#8220;go-to&#8221; guy back in 1998 when he informed us, after President Clinton bombed tool sheds in Afghanistan, that bin Laden issued this threat against the United States: &#8220;The battle has not started yet. The response will be with action and not words.&#8221; In the same article (which I took from Nando Times), ABC News is the source for an additional threat called in by Ayman al-Zawahiri, a senior bin Laden aide: &#8220;The war has just started. The Americans should wait for the answer.&#8221; Only a few months before that, ABC had conducted its televised interview of bin Laden. By the summer of 1998, primed by Atwan, ABC NEWS, and a surprisingly small clique of well-worn sources, we had come to know bin Laden as America&#8217;s latest &#8220;Saddam&#8221;, &#8220;Qaddafi&#8221;, &#8220;Noriega&#8221; &#8211; take your pick and set your bomb sites.</p>
<p>By October 2000, when the U.S.S. Cole was bombed in Yemen, in case there was any doubt, Atwan offered Reuters his helpful analysis with regards to the source of blame: &#8220;I do not rule out that this was undertaken by Osama bin Laden. Yemeni groups don&#8217;t have the experience to carry out this kind of operation.&#8221;  Atwan informed Reuters that bin Laden &#8220;was unlikely to claim direct responsibility for Thursday&#8217;s attack for fear of U.S. reprisals.&#8221; One can imagine, then, that Atwan gave his trusting phone mate cause for many a sleepless night. With friends like these&#8230;</p>
<p>Leading up to 9/11, by the Spring of 2001, an incriminating wedding videotape, apparently implicating bin Laden in the Yemen bombing, was circulating around the Middle East after being broadcast on the ubiquitous al-Jazeera television station (reconstituted from the BBC TV Arabic Service &#8211; more on them later). In the video, bin Laden, according to the Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper (more on them later, too), recited a poem celebrating the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole (shades of deja vu here?) This from the ABCNEWS.com site dated March 1: &#8220;Al-Hayat, which carried a photo of bin Laden and his son at the wedding, said its correspondent was the only journalist at the ceremony, also attended by bin Laden&#8217;s mother, two brothers and sister who flew to Kandahar from Saudi Arabia.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, here, too, Atwan offers his thoughtful review of the bin Laden video, courtesy of PTI, datelined London June 22, 2001: &#8220;[Atwan] said the video was proof that the fugitive Saudi millionaire [the Bruce Wayne of terrorists] was fit, well equipped and confident enough to send out a call to arms.&#8221; Why this sudden need for proof? According to Atwan in the same article: &#8220;There have been rumours that [bin Laden] is ill and that he is being contained by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It is quite clear from the film that he is in good health to the point where he can fire a rifle, and is free to operate as he chooses.&#8221; In other words, limber enough for his starring role in the months ahead.</p>
<p>So who is Abdel Bari Atwan and why is he anxious to tell us so much? According to the Winter 1999 issue of INEAS (Institute of Near Eastern and African Studies), Abdel Bari Atwan, a Palestinian, was born in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip in 1950. Educated at the American University of Cairo, Atwan moved to Saudi Arabia and worked as a writer for the al-Madina newspaper. In 1978, he moved to London, where he became a correspondent for the Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper. In 1988, after shuffling around between Saudi-owned papers, Atwan was offered a position as editor of al-Quds al-Arabi. By his account, he was offered a position as the executive editor of the Saudi-owned al-Hayat (of the bin Laden wedding video coup), yet turned it down to produce a more independent newspaper as a challenge to the &#8220;empires&#8221; of the Saudi-dominated dailies.</p>
<p>Al-Quds began production in April 1989. A little more than a year later, Saddam invaded Kuwait and al-Quds stood alone as the only Arab newspaper opposed to the Persian Gulf War &#8211; at least by Atwan&#8217;s account. According to Atwan: &#8220;Without the Gulf War, we wouldn&#8217;t have taken such political lines, which made us well recognized and well respected.&#8221; In November 1996, Bari-Atwan braved a twelve-hour car ride through muddy roads, attired in shabby Afghani rags in below-zero weather, and gave us the early scoop on bin Laden, conducting a one-on-one interview in bin Laden&#8217;s [bat]cave. From then on, the mainstream media &#8211; CNN, ABC, BBC, Sky News &#8211; looked to Bari-Atwan and al-Quds as the &#8220;independent&#8221; voice of the Arab street.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in a discussion concerning the matter of Saudi domination of the Arabic media, taken from the Carryon.oneworld.org site, Atwan, as editor of his struggling independent, was facing off against Jihad Khazen, the editor of the Saudi-owned al-Hayat. As Atwan proudly related in support of his independence: &#8220;One day I was called by the BBC-TV Arabic service [whose staff later reconstituted itself as al-Jazeera television]: &#8216;There&#8217;s a story on your front page today, saying such and such. Is it true?&#8217; I asked why he should doubt it and he replied: &#8216;It&#8217;s not published in al-Hayat [his job offer] or al-Sharq al-Awsat [his alma mater].&#8217; &#8221; Atwan boasts: &#8220;At least I can say we are 95 to 96 per cent independent&#8221; &#8211; leaving out the 4 to 5 per cent spent on bin Laden, I presume. Whether or not al-Quds truly is independent, this is the cover story the mainstream media buys into when they come trolling for their &#8220;independent&#8221; evidence.</p>
<p>So, to elaborate further on this (so far) fruitful hypothesis, it is my contention that al-Qaida and bin Laden are elaborate &#8220;legends&#8221; set up to promote a plausibly sophisticated and ferocious enemy to stand against American interests. I am not, however, implying that bin Laden himself is a total fabrication. Rather, it is my contention that confederates, believing themselves to act on behalf of bin Laden, are being set up in a &#8220;false flag operation&#8221; to perform operations as their controllers see fit.  And who are these controllers? If they&#8217;re anything resembling the folks who brought you Hizbullah and Hamas, you wouldn&#8217;t be sweating the suitcase nukes (made in America), the Ames strain anthrax (made in America), the MI5-like &#8220;sleeper agents&#8221; and coded &#8220;go&#8221; messages. Instead, you would be dodging primitive nail bombs and road mines &#8211; and not needing Abdel Bari Atwan to feed you the lowdown on the blame.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that bin Laden is of Saudi origin, that much of the &#8220;evidence&#8221; on the Arab side initially originated from Saudi-owned or Gulf Anglo-client state sources, and that Saudi Arabia is the major financial sponsor of the Taliban brand of fundamentalism in Afghanistan (as a counter-point to Iran), I believe it is fair to say that Saudi Arabia might possibly be implicated. &#8221; Most likely, the Saudis performed their roles as subservient proxies. We&#8217;ll get to the ultimate controllers soon enough (if you haven&#8217;t already guessed where this is going). And now, to fill out the picture further, it is necessary to name an equally essential partner as proxy &#8211; Pakistan, or, more specifically, Pakistan&#8217;s version of the CIA &#8211; the ISI (Interservices Intelligence Directorate).</p>
<p>And this is where we begin to &#8220;close the circle&#8221; of our close-knit pre-9/11 propaganda clique. Returning again to the above-mentioned Dan Eggen and Vernon Loeb Post article of September 12, we&#8217;re offered &#8211; in a powerful little side-bar &#8211; more critical evidence implicating bin Laden for the attacks the day before. This time, the bombshell is offered by Palestinian journalist Jamal Ismail, Abu Dhabi Television&#8217;s bureau chief in Islamabad. According to Ismail, a bin Laden aide called him &#8220;early Wednesday on a satellite telephone from a hide-out in Afghanistan,&#8221; praising the attack yet denying any responsibility for it.  As it turns out, Ismail was also among the select few to conduct his very own bin Laden interview, published by Newsweek in its April 1, 1999 issue. Here is how Newsweek described Ismail&#8217;s good fortune: &#8220;Palestinian journalist Jamal Ismail&#8217;s mobile phone rang just before prayers on December 18. &#8216;Peace be upon you, &#8216; said the voice on the line. &#8216;You may not recognize me, but I know you.&#8217; &#8221; And thus was Jamal Ismail invited on his own mud-soaked incursion to the bin Laden [bat]cave.</p>
<p>Searching deeper, I found an interesting obscure article penned by respected Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufszai in The News Jang, and dated May 3, 2000.  It details the detention of two men of Kurdish origin, accused by the Taliban of spying for American and Israeli intelligence. As Yusufszai relates it, he spoke to the only journalists allowed by the Taliban to interview the detained men &#8211; Jamal Ismail and his cameraman. Apparently, Ismail had a special relationship with the Taliban, allowing him this rare privilege above other journalists. And, as we shall shortly see, so does Yusufszai.  One wonders who debriefs them at the end of a workday. But more interestingly, by May 5, as reported by Kathy Gannon for the Associated Press, the story acquires &#8211; as they say &#8211; &#8220;new legs.&#8221; Not only are the basic elements of the Yusufszai story mentioned, but the article leads off with the bombshell that one of the detained men revealed that he was recruited by the United States to find Osama bin Laden. It finishes with a little coda implicating bin Laden in the 1998 embassy bombings. Thus, in the space of two days, Yusufszai&#8217;s Pakistani &#8220;spy&#8221; article sprouts a bin Laden addition when fertilized by the American Associated Press &#8211; and nicely provides a plausible explanation as to why a Kurd would be prowling around Afghanistan on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>Yusufszai, incidentally, moonlighted as an ABC News producer, charged with guiding ABC News correspondent John Miller through the Afghani marshes to the bin Laden [bat]cave &#8211; one of the very few American journalists to be accorded such an honour (and also, as it happens, a good friend of bin Laden arch-foe John O&#8217;Neill. But not chummy enough to direct O&#8217;Neill on to bin Laden&#8217;s hideaway). Moreover, Ismail and Yusufszai are mentioned together in a CNN article posted January 4, 1999 &#8211; the former for his Newsweek interview, the latter for his own bin Laden dialogue for TIME Magazine the day later.</p>
<p>Rahimullah Yusufszai, regarded by New York Times reporters John Burns and Steve LeVine as &#8220;one man who has seen more of the Taliban than any other outsider,&#8221; is also named by The Nation, in its article of January 27, 1997, as &#8220;one of the favourite journalists of [Pakistan's] ISI&#8230;one of the organizations funding and arming the Taliban. &#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small world after all. In the September 29, 2001 article of PressPlus, Yusufszai&#8217;s ABC colleague, John Miller, mused about running into his buddy John O&#8217;Neill in Yemen while reporting on the U.S.S. Cole bombing the year before. &#8220;He said, &#8216;So this is the Elaine&#8217;s of Yemen.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a terrible irony to all this,&#8221; Miller said. I&#8217;ll say: Miller, one of the very few Americans who can give a first-hand account of bin Laden, bumps into his friend, bin Laden&#8217;s chief investigator, while both are investigating a bombing in Yemen that will later be tagged onto bin Laden &#8211; and only a year before O&#8217;Neill dies at the hands of&#8230; allegedly &#8230;bin Laden.</p>
<p>Now, following the logic of my hypothesis, if the bin Laden threat was, pre-9/11, a close-knit propaganda campaign, one would expect to find the same names showing up repeatedly in combination with one another. This, too, applies to the American commentators. Let us return to the August 1998 American bombings of bin Laden&#8217;s tool sheds as an example. The night of the bombing, Rahimullah Yusufszai received a call from bin Laden aide Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a report from the Associated Press. Later, Yusufszai obtained for ABC News exclusive photos of the damage to bin Laden&#8217;s camp. Further commentary describing the layout of the bin Laden camp was furnished to the Washington Post by former CIA analyst and terrorism expert Kenneth Katzman, as well as Harvey Kushner of Long Island University. Only little more than a week before that, Katzman and Kushner were offering their assessment of bin Laden&#8217;s culpability for the embassy bombings in Africa in a Washington Post article penned by Vernon Loeb and Walter Pincus. They were joined in this effort by Vincent Cannistraro, the ABC news analyst who also escorted John Miller to his bin Laden interview, as well as provided running commentary in the days immediately following 9/11. Cannistraro, a former CIA counterterrorism chief, provided covert aid to the Afghani mujaheddin in the late &#8217;80&#8242;s, as well as supervised CIA operations with the contras. He was also one of the point men in the notoriously circumspect investigation at Lockerbie. In the above-noted Loeb and Pincus article &#8211; in which bin Laden is quoted from the ABC News Miller and Yusufszai interview &#8211; Cannistraro weighs in with his assessment of the embassy bombings: &#8220;I believe Osama bin Laden is the sponsor of this operation, and I think all of the indications are pointing that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon after the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, a Vernon Loeb Post article, dated October 13, 2000, proceeded to implicate bin Laden through the detailed information provided by Kushner, Katzman, and Cannistraro.  Earlier, in a Vernon Loeb Post article dated July 3, 2000, Yusufszai, Kushner, and Cannistraro unveiled bin Laden aides Ayman al-Zawahiri and Muhammed Atef as the men to watch as bin Laden&#8217;s likely successors, with a helpful tidbit on the Zawahiri biography thrown in by the Saudi-owned al-Sharq al-Awsat.</p>
<p>None of the above, of course, is offered as the &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; pointing the way to a propaganda conspiracy, nor are my chosen examples meant to be exhaustive in evidencing this point. According to Felicity Barringer, in a New York Times article dated September 24, 2001:  &#8221;A good deal of the public information on bin Laden comes from the journalists who went to Afghanistan to interview him, including [Peter] Bergen, &#8230; Peter Arnett, John Miller, Rahimullah Yusufzai, and Jamal Ismail.&#8221;  The article further makes reference to Vernon Loeb, Al Quds al-Arabi (Atwan), Judith Miller, Al Jazeera, and Brian Jenkins (formerly of Kroll Associates &#8211; the security firm that obtained the WTC position for John O&#8217;Neill by way of Jerry Hauer).  Clearly, I have also not heretofore made mention of the other experts who have worked assiduously toward building our knowledge base on bin Laden &#8211; Steven Emerson, Daniel Pipes, Yossef Bodansky, and various British and EU elites. However, the above examples do show how the information flow on bin Laden could be plausibly managed by the skilfully placed revelations of a relatively insular clique of &#8220;experts&#8221; called upon repeatedly by the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Here is how it would work:  A relatively few well-connected correspondents provide the &#8220;scoops&#8221; that get the coverage in the relatively few mainstream news sources &#8211; the four TV networks, TIME, Newsweek, CNN &#8211; where the parameters of debate are set and the &#8220;official reality&#8221; is consecrated for the bottom feeders in the news chain. In other countries, this is what is known as propaganda &#8211; or, put less politely, psychological warfare.</p>
<p>But before I leave this topic, I would like to provide an example of &#8220;news management&#8221; that is revealing for what is omitted &#8211; that is, the &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; of Pakistani ISI involvement in the events of 9/11.  On October 9, 2001, the Times of India dropped this little bombshell:  &#8220;Top sources confirmed here on Tuesday that [ISI Chief Mahmud Ahmad] lost his job because of the &#8220;evidence&#8221; India produced to show his links to one of the suicide bombers that wrecked the World Trade Centre. The US authorities sought his removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 were wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh at the instance of Gen. Mahmud.&#8221;</p>
<p>What makes this particular piece so devastating is that only days before, much of the mainstream American media was touting the news of a &#8220;key link&#8221; in the chain of evidence linking bin Laden to the events of September 11 &#8211; namely, a $100,000 wire transfer to the hijackers from a shadowy operative linked to bin Laden.  Yet once this operative was &#8220;outed&#8221; as being linked instead to the Pakistani ISI Chief, any propaganda gains initially made through this evidence would now crumble.  One possible reason might stem from this Karachi News item, released only two days before September 11:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;[Pakistani] ISI Chief Lt-Gen Mahmood&#8217;s week-long presence in Washington has triggered speculation about the agenda of his mysterious meetings at the Pentagon and National Security Council. Officially, State Department sources say he is on a routine visit in return to [sic] CIA Director George Tenet&#8217;s earlier visit to Islamabad&#8230;What added interest to his visit is the history of such visits. Last time Ziauddin Butt, Mahmood&#8217;s predecessor, was here during Nawaz Sharif&#8217;s government the domestic politics turned topsy-turvy within days. That this is not the first visit by Mahmood in the last three months shows the urgency of the ongoing parleys&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In other words, this was a propaganda piece that went disastrously wrong. After October 9, bin Laden&#8217;s alleged paymaster could now be linked to a U.S. &#8220;ally&#8221; who spent the days before 9/11 in deep consultation at the Pentagon.  The US authorities immediately went into damage control mode by insisting on the quiet retirement of the &#8220;outed&#8221; ISI chief. Thus removed from the public eye, the ISI Chief&#8217;s role in all this could be effectively ignored, and an American media black-out could be safely assumed.</p>
<p>Such a scenario certainly fits in snugly with my hypothesis, which I will now proceed to elaborate completely. The events of September 11 were masterminded by those who were in the best position to manage the consequences &#8211; namely, those most able to manage the flow of information, those most able to coordinate all the elements necessary for the perpetration of a successful operation (subverting airport security, guiding the planes to their specific targets), and most significantly, those who stood to reasonably benefit in the aftermath. Conspiracies, by their very nature, are not crimes of passion. They may involve rational, albeit cold-blooded, attempts to achieve a desired end by employing the most effective means available. It is for this reason that &#8220;mainstream&#8221; terror groups like Hamas and Hizbullah largely avoid attacking American interests where such attacks would serve no practical interest. For all their talk of Jihad, these terror groups tend to plan their specific attacks with an eye to the consequences that could reasonably be expected to follow. Thus, knowing the moral and political constraints of Israeli deterrent strategies, they calibrate their attacks to elicit consequences that are most tolerable for them &#8211; and hence, manageable. Yet surely, in the light of the cult of suicidal martyrdom, such considerations no longer hold sway. Perhaps. But then, in the case of such a far-flung anti-Zionist movement as al-Qaida, one would expect at least a little more exertion against Israeli interests than has heretofore prevailed &#8211; unless, of course, the &#8220;point&#8221; of al-Qaida was to provide a plausible dire threat to American interests where none had then existed. In any case, as nobody has noticed this particular anomaly, there was no need for any needless exertion of resources in order to bolster a credibility that needed no bolstering in this one particular sector.</p>
<p>Motive, means, and opportunity. While I presented the Saudis and Pakistani intelligence as clear-cut proxies, the only motive these elements would have to benefit from a crime of this nature is an assurance that no punishment would be forthcoming but rather, they would be on the right side of power and wealth among those in a position to determine the booty.</p>
<p>Another anomaly: on the very day that the ISI Chief was in deep consultation at the Pentagon, Ahmed Shah Massoud, the head of the Afghani Northern Alliance &#8211; a cultishly popular figure within that group, and a mortal foe of Pakistan&#8217;s ISI &#8211; was assassinated by two terrorists posing as cameramen. Keeping in mind the fact that, throughout the &#8217;90&#8242;s, American leaders such as Clinton, and American companies such as Unocal, were largely throwing their support over to the Taliban in opposition to the Northern Alliance (or United Front), it seems rather convenient that, in the aftermath of 9/11, the way was now cleared for the Northern Alliance to be co-opted as an instrument for setting up a more pliant Afghani government (now headed, incidentally, by a former consultant to Unocal).</p>
<p>So who are the ultimate controllers? To begin with, the circumstantial evidence seems to point to an operative clique primarily based out of New York City and the State of Florida. I stress the word &#8220;operative&#8221;, as this clique appears to consist of subservient agents involved in laying the preparations. Once again, John O&#8217;Neill serves as an effective Rosetta Stone in interpreting the raw outlines of this operative clique (which is by no means a &#8220;rogue&#8221; clique). The FBI and CIA elements involved in counterterrorism have a checkered past. For one, Oliver North in the 1980&#8242;s served as Counterterrorism Chief while he used his office as a cover to deal with such narco-terrorists as Monzar al-Kassar (who figures in the crash at Lockerbie &#8211; also investigated by Cannistraro). In the late &#8217;90&#8242;s, O&#8217;Neill was transferred from the federal office of Counterrorism to the New York Counterrorism Office of the FBI &#8211; and it was the New York branch which was then designated as the primary investigator of all overseas investigations involving bin Laden. Moreover, this branch was also involved in the somewhat suspect investigation of TWA 800 &#8211; investigated by O&#8217;Neill and reported upon by ABC&#8217;s John Miller, who was formerly the Deputy Police Commissioner of Public Relations for the NYPD before he joined up with ABC.</p>
<p>As regards New York, there is another element involved in germ warfare operations. Actually, a multi-million dollar bunker &#8211; serving as a command and control center in the event of a biological attack &#8211; was set up at 7 World Trade Center at the direction of Rudolph Giuliani, who also oversaw the mass spraying of malathion over the boroughs of New York City when the West Nile Virus hit town a few summers previously.  The man Giuliani placed in charge of that operation, Jerry Hauer, also happened to be the man who found John O&#8217;Neill the position at the World Trade Center, as well as being the one who &#8211; by his own admission &#8211; identified O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a widespread campaign on to link the threat of al-Qaida with that of a mass biological attack. At least the day after September 11, the link &#8211; as the Anthrax mailings had yet to arise &#8211; was not so apparent. Yet on PBS&#8217; Frontline, the New York Times&#8217; Judith Miller (no apparent relation to John Miller, as far as I&#8217;m aware), accompanied by the New York Times&#8217; James Risen, was interviewed as an expert on al-Qaida. Several weeks later, Judith Miller would once more make the headlines as the apparent recipient of an anthrax mailing which turned out to be a false alarm &#8211; yet was all the same conveniently timed with the well-publicized launching of her book on&#8230;germ warfare. As was later discovered, the anthrax mailings petered out once the news leaked that a DNA test revealed the material to be of the Ames strain of anthrax, an agent synthesized out of a CIA laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Nevertheless, this was sufficient to fast-track Bioport&#8217;s exclusive license for the anthrax vaccine toward FDA approval. Formerly, Bioport&#8217;s experimental anthrax vaccine was being forcibly administered &#8211; under threat of court-martial &#8211; to hundreds of thousands of American servicemen (in conformity with Bioport&#8217;s exclusive and lucrative contract with the Department of Defense).</p>
<p>Incidentally, Judith Miller, along with Jerry Hauer, was among 17 &#8220;key&#8221; participants in a biowarfare exercise known as &#8220;Dark Winter&#8221; &#8211; a think tank-funded scenario that aimed to study the nationwide effects of a hypothetical smallpox outbreak.  One of the sponsors of that exercise was the Anser Institute of Homeland Security, an organization established <em>before</em> September 11, 2001.  Interestingly enough, the curious phrase &#8220;homeland security&#8221; was starting to creep up with increasing frequency in the vocabularies of certain political cliques (Dick Cheney, the Hart-Rudman Commission, et al.) in the year or two leading up to 9/11.</p>
<p>The point of the above-noted information is to draw attention to an apparent propaganda campaign to prepare the public for a catastrophic biological attack. As with the Twin Towers, the blame for any coming attack may be duly and plausibly assigned by those who carefully laid the groundwork in preparing us for this eventuality.</p>
<p>As for Florida, the connection with this state is obvious, for not only was the first anthrax mailing directed to the Florida offices of the National Enquirer, but many of the accused hijackers were also reported to receive their pilot training from flight schools in Venice and Tampa. Notably, it was a Florida bank account to which hijacker Mohamed Atta allegedly deposited his 9/11 pay cheque.  Moreover, Florida, by way of the MacDill Air Force Base, is also Central Command for the war in Afghanistan.  In addition to its function as Central Command for the war on terrorism, MacDill is -outside of Langley &#8211; also a major base of the CIA. Thus, in the CIA&#8217;s own backyard, we find the infrastructure and financial support that went into the planning for the events of 9/11. And, as we so often find with events surrounding 9/11, another synchronicity &#8211; for coincidentally enough, the woman who reportedly happened to find an apartment for one of the alleged hijackers was the wife of the senior editor of the National Enquirer. Moreover, her husband, Michael Irish, also happened to make use of an airfield that reportedly served as flight training for some of the hijackers. I emphasize the word &#8220;reportedly,&#8221; as the possibility always exists that this &#8220;reported fact&#8221; may be nothing more than <em>dis</em>information, strategically placed to divert attention from a possibly more subtle truth.  In intelligence operations, foreign assets are often placed with resident &#8220;controllers&#8221; whose job it is to supervise the asset as well as provide accommodations as the need arises. Who are Michael and Gloria Irish? Or, perhaps more revealingly, what kind of social circles do they run with? This is certainly an avenue worth exploring &#8211; by reason of its many synchrocities if for nothing else. Again, the seam that shows.</p>
<p>As a little side-note, Tampa experienced its own mass spraying of malathion, a mutagenic pesticide, when it encountered a med fly outbreak the year before New York&#8217;s West Nile outbreak.  In the end, the flies were contained through a sterile med fly program administered out of MacDill Air Force base.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, it appears that the events of September 11 were planned years in advance, with the groundwork being carefully laid by a propaganda campaign orchestrated to convince the public that the United States has a plausibly sophisticated nemesis with the motive, means, and opportunity to perpetrate a devastating act of terror against Americans. Toward that end, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have been used as the primary proxy agents to run a &#8220;false flag&#8221; operation, setting up and financing the infrastructure of al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Through madrassas based in Pakistan, Saudi and Yemenite militants were instructed in the Saudi brand of Wahabbi Islam, and subsequently &#8220;graduated&#8221; to the camps that were set up in Afghanistan &#8211; again, under Saudi and Pakistani sponsorship. Stateside, the operative agents were mostly based out of New York City and Florida. In the aftermath of 9/11, elements in the American government are now widely disseminating information in vast quantities, overwhelming the populace and lending credibility to the government&#8217;s version of events. Thus, post-9/11, the actions of this formerly insular propaganda clique are no longer perceptible. Information is now being doled out in generous portions to credulous reporters who are outside the loop, yet perform their unwitting service as &#8220;bottom feeders&#8221; in the downward flow of information.</p>
<p>In all cases, the actions of these proxy agents and operative planners are sufficiently distanced and compartmentalized from the true masterminds to create a condition of &#8220;plausible deniability&#8221;. In short, the proxies have also been set up as possible patsies with evidence that has been carefully laid to incriminate them should cracks in the &#8220;official story&#8221; become too discernible. Moreover, the groundwork has already been carefully laid to cast aspersions on another convenient patsy &#8211; the Jews, by way of the State of Israel and its supporters. Already, for those prone to perceive Jewish conspiracies, the reliable vein of anti-Semitism &#8211; combined with anti-Zionism &#8211; has been mined to distract the masses and to create a modern version of the ritual blood libel, thereby further &#8220;muddying the waters&#8221; should the true masterminds be threatened with exposure. In other words, the present difficulties in the Middle East work perfectly to set up the State of Israel as a plausible alternative suspect with motive, means, and opportunity. Toward that end, a low-level &#8220;buzz&#8221; has been circulating over the Internet (and especially in Europe) of an Israeli spy ring that was rounded up in the days after September 11.  Whether or not these reports are credible is not the point.  Most likely, there was a spy ring operating, and various Israelis were unwittingly set up as patsies, to be exposed should the need arise. Thus, while evidence may be marshaled to taint the Saudis, Pakistanis, or Israelis, the real guilt must inevitably lie with those in the best position to manage the flow of information as well as reliably benefit from the new order created, primarily, the political and corporate elites of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union &#8211; also, as it happens, the very parties orchestrating the global war on terrorism. In this respect, the Saudis, Pakistanis, or Israelis have far less to gain (other than the benefits of going along with the designs of the rich and mighty).</p>
<p>I could go on and further highlight the obvious geostrategic gains of those who are clearly managing the flow of information &#8211; the proverbial pipelines, oil, wealth, and so forth. But I think those purported benefits are a bit of a &#8220;red herring&#8221; &#8211; more of a side benefit than the main motivating factor. Americans and their allies would have easily supported a thrust into Afghanistan for a provocation far less costly and bloody than this (such as Kuwait in the early &#8217;90&#8242;s).  It is no small act to intentionally take down such an overarching symbol of financial stability as the Twin Towers, and chance killing thousands in the process. Such a conspiracy, if in fact perpetrated from within, would by its nature necessitate a huge structural, cultural, and demographic change. The very brazenness of the act, the naked aggression, would necessitate a tenacious determination to achieve the ends for which these actions were perpetrated.  There is no going back now. An infrastructure is being laid out &#8211; one that will, finally, provide a dissident-proof totalitarian oligarchy composed of like-minded elites served by an under-class kept under constant surveillance. The edifice of this regime is being constructed, brick by brick, with the mortar of the Office of Homeland Security (to centralize and coordinate an effective police state), the Freedom Corps (to indoctrinate the most idealist &#8211; and therefore activist &#8211; elements of the populace toward service to the state), and the Patriot Act (to provide the legal basis for subverting long-held rights under the screen of national security). If all of this sounds strangely familiar, if it is redolent of Huxley and Orwell, that is perhaps because Huxley and Orwell were both intimately involved with the elites of their time &#8211; in fact, were fully subsumed among them &#8211; in ways that made their future projections abundantly prescient, and, in their minds, inevitable. With further refinements in mind control technologies &#8211; yes, they do exist &#8211; as well as the monopolization of the food supply by way of sterile seed &#8220;terminator technology&#8221; &#8211; the approval for which was granted in the months following 9/11 &#8211; the masses may be perpetually culled and exploited by those who hold the keys to this fully managed society.</p>
<p>If this notion of reality strikes you as somewhat dissonant, at odds with your own personal experience, it may be perhaps that we have not quite arrived there yet, and that you have personally not felt the corrosive lash of political corruption and governmental malfeasance. In all likelihood, you have not read the mountain of evidence detailing political and elite deviant behaviour in this country. You may even be dismissive of &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221;, yet wholly unaware of the well-documented attempts by the CIA and FBI to subvert, surveil, and propagandize the populace through programs such as Project Mockingbird (media infiltration) and MK-Ultra (mind control through chemical, hypnotic, or electro-magnetic means). These programs are effected primarily through &#8220;think tanks&#8221; that are set up across the United States for the purpose of disseminating information and propaganda under the rubric of &#8220;expertise&#8221;. Moreover, various foundations, such as the Rockefeller or Ford Foundations, are often used as funnels to finance and feed the arteries of these propaganda networks. In the 1970&#8242;s, a good deal of this structural corruption was officially exposed &#8211; in a &#8220;limited hang-out&#8221; &#8211; by way of the Church Commission, as well as the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Thereafter, much of the most damaging revelations were played down or ignored by the mainstream media, and the waters were then muddied by a stream of outlandish conspiracy theories &#8211; aliens, Elvis, etc. &#8211; that merely served to discredit the information that was most credible. &#8220;Muddying the waters&#8221;, incidentally, is a tried and true staple of the intelligence craft.</p>
<p>It is really just a matter of familiarizing yourself with all the documented anomalies that do not accord with the received, mainstream reality put forth to you by the mainstream media. As a practical guide to begin, you might want to confine your search to strictly &#8220;mainstream&#8221; sources, as I have sought to do in attempting to construct my case on 9/11. My evidence is by no means exhaustive. In fact, it is merely the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Yet proceeding in this direction, under my hypothesis, has been most fruitful in analyzing the various anomalies that pop up now and then.</p>
<p>Any simple keyword search of the following terms may be helpful in pointing toward a more substantive understanding of the elites who ultimately guide your fortunes: &#8220;Iran-Contra&#8221; , &#8220;Mena&#8221;, &#8220;BCCI&#8221;, &#8220;Project Paperclip&#8221;, &#8220;Michael Aquino&#8221;, &#8220;Paul Bonacci&#8221;, &#8220;Operation Northwoods&#8221;, &#8220;MK-Ultra&#8221;. Much of the information on these topics is credible and well-documented. More disturbingly, it highlights behavior committed by the very same elites who are now interpreting the events of 9/11 for you. Read for yourself, and decide, at the end of the day, how much credibility you will continue to accord to those who claim to be the proper trustees of your fate and well-being.</p>

Accuses Moscow of Intervening in US Elections. &#8220;Russian Hackers invading America’s Cyberspace&#8221;</a></h2>
<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 7th, 2016</strong> by Sputnik</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p><em>President Barack Obama took a hardline during discussions with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 Summit parroting the theory of Hillary and the Democrats that Moscow has nothing better to do than intervene in America’s election. </em></p>
<p>Following the G20 conference in Hangzhou, President Obama said that the issue of Russian hackers invading America’s cyberspace was a critical issue he raised during the summit amid a bout of anti-Russia hysteria in the United States provoked by claims that Putin has converted Republican nominee Donald Trump into an agent of the Kremlin in addition to concerns regarding the DNC Leaks.</p>
<p>Federal Probe into &#8216;Russia&#8217;s Influence&#8217; in US Election Aims to Smear Trump &#8220;We have had problems with cyber intrusions from Russia in the past,&#8221; but he cautioned that the United States would not immediately seek to play into a &#8220;cycle of escalation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we cannot do is have a situation where this becomes the wild, wild West, where countries that have significant cyber capacity start engaging in unhealthy competition or conflict through those means,&#8221; said Obama.</p>
<p>It was then that President Obama hurled headlong into threatening a cyber war against Russia saying, &#8220;Look, we’re moving into a new era here where a number of countries have significant capacity. And frankly, we’ve got more capacity than anybody, both offensively and defensively.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments made by President Obama do not exist in a vacuum with the White House initiating a federal probe into Russian intervention in the 2016 presidential campaign following a letter by Senator Harry Reid to FBI Director James Comey asserting that Putin may alter Election Day results to benefit Trump who he referred to as a treasonous agent of Russia in three out of five paragraphs.</p>
<p>Reid’s claims and the ensuing investigation follow in the wake of the much publicized DNC email dump by WikiLeaks that exposed a concerted scheme by Hillary’s campaign to collude with the DNC and mainstream media pundits to spin false narratives about her primary election opponent.</p>
<p>While Russia has denied any involvement in the leak, the Hillary campaign claims that Russian hackers had breached their systems and occupied the DNC server for over a year conflating the issue of a hack and the leak. In previous election cycles, both political parties have been hacked by as many as a dozen countries that seek to garner information on the potential next president of the United States.</p>
<p>Hysteria took full force last week when it was reported that the election systems of Arizona and Illinois were breached by hackers with officials immediately pointing the finger at Russia despite a lack of evidence.</p>
<p>What was actually hacked in Illinois, however, was not an election system, but rather a voter file that is already accessible to people online with names, phone numbers and party affiliation – supposedly 200,000 or so records were &#8220;exfiltrated&#8221; (copied and pasted) which is hardly anything of value to a state actor. In Arizona, a hacker obtained the login key for an employee at the Gila County Recorder’s office, but no voter records were modified. Due to redundancies in Arizona’s electoral system, even if a record were modified it would have no effect because three different government agencies maintain a file of voters.</p>
<p>Not only has Russia faced continued insinuation that they are responsible for hacks that have potentially impacted the tone and tenor of the 2016 election cycle, but the country has also come under fire due to Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort’s connection to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych who Russia favored.</p>
<p>From there, theories have been concocted that a three-star US General who was America’s top intelligence official, Michael Flynn, was somehow in league with the Russians because he attended a Gala to celebrate Russian funded news station RT’s 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>Green Party candidate Jill Stein has faced similar personal accusations of disloyalty to the country for her attendance at the same event. President Vladimir Putin vehemently denies the allegations of Russia’s involvement in the DNC leak saying &#8220;I don’t know anything about it and on a state level Russia has never done this&#8221; but regarded the transmission of the information of potential malfeasance by Hillary’s campaign and the DNC as a &#8220;public service.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Shifting the Focus</strong></p>
<p>So rank are the injustices wrought upon Okinawa, and so long continuing, that I am led to conjecture that the reason the world pays so little attention to the issues and makes such muted criticism of the governments largely responsible for the injustices must be that the situation is so complex and so little-reported as to defy understanding. Historians and political scientists pay close attention to the East China Sea, but tend to see it, and the military conflicts that occur around it, through the prism of the nation state. In what follows, I look at the present and recent past of the “Okinawa problem” through the prism of Okinawa, paying closest attention to how the Okinawan people see their recent past and present. I focus especially on the years of the (second) Abe Shinzo government (beginning December 2012).</p>
<p>This essay is designed to chart a path and see a pattern in the struggles in the courts and on the Okinawan streets over recent decades, in the hope that it might serve as a kind of basic compendium on today’s Okinawa problem.<sup>1</sup> How can it be that the Japanese state should now be attempting to sweep aside the overwhelming opposition of the Okinawan people in order to enforce the reclamation and construction works for a major Marine Corps facility at Henoko and for a string of Marine Corps “Osprey” landing zones in the vicinity of Takae hamlet in Higashi village, and that it by and large escapes international scrutiny for doing this, despite deploying high levels of discrimination and violence towards Okinawa in the process?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/schwabapj.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544248]" title="schwabapj"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5544393" title="schwabapj" src="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/schwabapj.jpg" alt="" width="701" height="134"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “Okinawa problem” is complicated because it combines inter-state and intra-state elements. In its present, intense, form the antagonism between the Japanese nation state and the people and government of Okinawa dates to 1995 but its roots go back at least four centuries. For roughly half a millennium (1372-1879) these islands constituted the Ryukyu kingdom, self-governed and part of the China-centred “tribute system” world. Tribute missions plied the routes between Okinawa (then Ryukyu) and the China coast and ritual submission, evidently unmarked by violence or threat, seems to have generated less dissent than anywhere else in the then Sinic world. Twice, however, over these years, the mutually beneficial relationship was disrupted by violence and the threat of violence, on both occasions emanating from Japan, from the pre-modern state of Satsuma in 1609, and then decisively from the modern Meiji state in 1879, which simply incorporated the islands and abolished the kingdom.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>China protested, but those two interventions, taking place at moments of maximum Chinese weakness and disorder, the early 17<sup>th</sup> century decline of the Ming dynasty in the former case and the late 19<sup>th</sup> century decline of the Qing dynasty in the latter, were decisive. On both occasions the disruptive force came from Japanese militarism and imperialism, in the pre-modern form represented by Satsuma’s samurai and in the modern by the Meiji Japanese state. In the context of imperialist encroachment, civil war, and general decline of the 19<sup>th</sup> century in particular, China had no way to protest effectively against the Japanese severance of the China link and incorporation of Ryukyu as Okinawa prefecture. Negotiations towards a diplomatic agreement on the East China Sea border (and its islands, including not only Okinawa but also Miyako, Ishigaki and Yonaguni) in 1880-81 ended without resolution – although Japan had signalled its readiness to abandon the border islands – and eventually Japan dictated its terms on the region by victory in the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-5. When Chinese voices in a much later era were raised to complain that there had been no negotiated diplomatic settlement of the East China Sea, it was strictly speaking correct.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In 1945 Okinawa was the sole part of Japan that suffered the full force of American ground invasion and the “typhoon of steel” that pulverized the island, resulting in the deaths of between one-quarter and one-third of the population. As the war turned to occupation, and with the survivors in internment camps, the US enforced its claim to the prefecture’s best lands, upon which it then constructed the network of military bases that remain to this day, a process remembered in Okinawa as one of “bayonet and bulldozer.” In the peace agreement eventually signed at San Francisco occupation, the Japanese government, in part following the express wish of the emperor, encouraged the US to retain full control over Okinawa, with the result that it was 1972 before “administrative control” reverted to Japan. Even then, however, “reversion” was nominal, because the US retained its assets, the chain of bases, and extraterritorial authority over them, and even exacted a huge payment from Japan accompanying the deal.</p>
<p>During the 27-year period when Okinawa was completely under US rule, when there was no democracy and no mechanism for registering Okinawan protest, the American base structure was reduced in Japan proper but concentrated and expanded in Okinawa prefecture. 74 per cent of US base presence in Japan came to be concentrated on Okinawa’s 0.6 per cent of the national land. Over the 44 years since “reversion “ Okinawan governments have sought in vain to regain the sovereignty then lost, facing governments in Tokyo committed to faithful service of the US. As the Cold War was liquidated elsewhere, despite Okinawan expectations of liberation, it was retained and reinforced for them, and they were subject to persistent lying, deception, manipulation and discrimination.<sup>4</sup> Okinawa became, and remains, to today a joint US-Japanese colony in all but name.</p>
<p>Richard Falk sets the “forgotten” Okinawan problem in comparative context:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The tragic fate that has befallen Okinawa and its people results from being a ‘colony’ in a post-colonial era … captive of a militarized world order that refuses to acknowledge the supposedly inalienable right of self-determination. From a global perspective [Okinawa] is a forgotten remnant of the colonial past … In this respect it bears a kinship with such other forgotten peoples as those living in Kashmir, Chechenya, Xinjiang, Tibet, Puerto Rico, Palau, [the] Marianas Islands, among others.”<a name="_ftnref5" href="http://apjjf.org/2016/17/McCormack.html#_ftn5"></a>[5]</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, and especially under the two Abe Shinzo governments (2006-2007 and 2012- ) Japan’s defence and security systems have moved closer to full integration with those of the US. Major new facilities are under way for the US in Okinawa, Guam and the Marianas, and for the Japanese Self-Defense Forces on the Southwestern islands of Amami, Miyako, and the Yaeyama’s (Ishigaki and Yonaguni), while Abe proceeds towards setting up Japanese versions of the CIA and the Marine Corps (an &#8220;amphibious rapid deployment brigade&#8221;). In the first year of his second spell as Prime Minister, Abe alarmed Washington with his history and identity agenda (Yasukuni, comfort women, war memory) but gradually and under intense pressure he shifted his focus to economy and security, more than compensating, and setting aside for the time being the former. His security agenda depends on establishing Okinawa as joint American-Japanese military headquarters for the East Asian region.</p>
<p><strong>Henoko, 1996-2012</strong></p>
<p>Just 16 kms east of the capital, Naha, lies the bustling city of Ginowan, about one-quarter of which (including what should be its mid-city) is taken up by Futenma Marine Air Station. US forces first occupied the site around 70 years ago when the residents of the area had been rounded up into detention centres even before the formal Japanese surrender at the end of the war, and have continued to occupy it, in breach of international law (Article 46 of the 1907 Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War forbids occupying armies from confiscation of private property) even if with the consent, or encouragement, of the government of Japan, ever since. Okinawan resentment for long was simmering, but with the gang-rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three US servicemen in 1995, it came to the boil. A year later, in 1996, the governments of Japan and the US struck a deal: its main provisions were that Futenma Air Station would be returned to Japan “within 5 to 7 years” on condition that an alternative “heliport” facility for the marine Corps be provided, and that about half of the Yambaru forest area spanning Higashi and Kunigami villages, known to the Americans as Camp Gonsalves and serving as a Jungle Warfare Centre, would also be returned when additional “helipads” were substituted for those in the area to be returned.</p>
<p>As the 1972 “reversion” deal had cloaked “retention” of key US bases and extraterritorial privileges under the Status of Forces Agreement or SOFA, so this 1996 agreement for apparent “reversion” cloaked a significant expansion and upgrade of US military facilities. Henoko on Oura Bay was the designated site for a mega military complex, and the Yambaru forest for a supplementary chain of mini-bases.</p>
<p>The “Futenma Replacement Facility” (FRF) agreed between the two governments of Japan and the US in 1996 would be a “heliport” built at Henoko on Oura Bay. Okinawans struggled by mass non-violent resistance, however, to such extent that the first (1999) design, for a demountable, offshore “floating base,” was cancelled in 2005 because, as then Prime Minister Koizumi put it, of “a lot of opposition”<sup>6</sup> and, as was later learned, because the Japanese Coastguard was reluctant to be involved in enforcing the removal of protesters from the site for fear of bloodshed.<sup>7</sup> In its stead the current (2006) design, for extension of the existing Camp Schwab Marine Corps site by substantial reclamation into Oura Bay, was adopted. It grew into today&#8217;s project to reclaim 160 hectares of sea fronting Henoko Bay to the east and Oura Bay to the west, imposing on it a mass of concrete towering 10 metres above the sea and featuring two 1,800 metre runways and a deep-sea 272 meter-long dock, constituting a land-sea-air base with its own deep-water port and other facilities. Smaller in area, it would be far more multifunctional and amount to a significant upgrade of the inconvenient and obsolescent Futenma.</p>
<p>Alongside the nearby massive Kadena US Air Force (USAF) base, the prospective Henoko facility would serve through the 21<sup>st</sup> century as potentially the largest concentration of land, sea, and air military power in East Asia, from which Japanese and US forces would combine to confront and contain China. The Abe government’s public and often repeated rationale for Henoko construction, moreover, is that it is the <em>only</em>way to accomplish reversion of the Marine Corps’ Futenma base.</p>
<p>However, though less densely populated than the Futenma vicinity, Henoko happens to be one of the most bio-diverse and spectacularly beautiful marine and coastal zones in all Japan, core to the &#8220;Amami-Ryukyu island zone that the Ministry of the Environment wants to promote as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It hosts a cornucopia of life forms from blue–and many other species of–coral (with the countless micro-organisms to which they are host) through crustaceans, sea cucumbers and seaweeds and hundreds of species of shrimp, snail, fish, tortoise, snake and mammal, many rare or endangered and strictly protected. In the seas the dugong and Japan’s only intact coral reef, and in the forest the Yambarukuina rail and Noguchigera woodpecker, have come to stand for all the creatures of the site vicinity.</p>
<p>When the Democratic Party assumed office in 2009, it found that its hands had been tied by a formal government to government agreement, the “Guam International Agreement,” negotiated in haste by Hillary Clinton to shield the Futenma substitution agreement from any attempt by a new government to revisit it.<sup>8</sup> Months later, as Clinton had foreseen, Hatoyama Yukio came to office pledging to transfer Futenma &#8220;at least outside Okinawa&#8221; (<em>saitei demo kengai</em>). His efforts to accomplish this were feeble and the Guam International Agreement locked his government into submission. His failed promise to Okinawa nevertheless helped sowed seeds of hope that have underpinned the anti-base movement ever since.</p>
<p>By the time Abe Shinzo formed a government in December 2012, he faced an unprecedented Okinawan consensus, shared by the Governor, Prefectural and City Assemblies, prefectural chapters of the major national political parties (including Liberal Democratic Party and New Komeito), the two main newspapers and majority opinion in general (according to repeated surveys): it was time to wind back the US military presence, not reinforce it; Oura Bay had to be saved. If a new base was needed, it could be constructed outside Okinawa.</p>
<p><strong>Futenma/Henoko from 2012</strong></p>
<p>The government of Abe Shinzo, in his second term commencing in December 2012, faced this solid phalanx of opposition (in effect, the entire prefecture), but was determined nevertheless that Henoko would be built according to plan.<sup>9</sup> In January 2013, an extraordinary Okinawan delegation, the <em>Kempakusho</em>, made up of the heads of Okinawan cities, towns and villages, and prefectural assembly representatives, called on the government in Tokyo to demand unconditional closure and return of Futenma, abandonment of the Henoko base substitute project and withdrawal of the MV-22 Osprey vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) Marine Corps aircraft. The delegation was headed by Naha City mayor, Onaga Takeshi, and many of its members were, like Onaga, staunchly conservative. Abe brusquely dismissed them and the coldness and abuse they experienced both from him and in the streets of Tokyo helped feed the identity politics that later became “All Okinawa.”</p>
<p>Thereafter, Prime Minister Abe concentrated on dividing and neutralizing that opposition. LDP party chief Ishiba Shigeru expressed what was probably the shared view within government when he wrote of the burgeoning protest movement in his blog (on 29 November 2013) that after all there was little difference in substance between vociferous demonstrators and terrorists.<sup>10</sup> Opposition to any Oura Bay construction rose steadily, from 74 per cent in late April of 2014 to over 80 per cent in late August.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Through 2013, Abe secured the surrender, first, in April of two prominent Okinawan Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) Diet members, followed in December by the Okinawa chapter of the LDP itself and eventually by the Governor, Nakaima Hirokazu, who issued the necessary license for reclamation of Oura Bay as site for the base. Abe then turned to serious preparations for reclamation and construction, declaring, at the beginning of July 2014, just over half of Oura Bay off limits and initiating the preliminary boring survey. Despite the unfailingly non-violent character of the Okinawan movement, large numbers of prefectural riot police were sent against them, reinforced from late the following year by detachments from all over Japan. The riot police land force was matched at sea by the National Coastguard, whose armed vessels were commissioned to fend off the canoes and kayaks of protesters.</p>
<p>The surrender of the Okinawa branch of the LDP in December 2013, however, was not enough to break the prefectural opposition. Instead it was the Okinawan LDP that split, turncoats submitting to Abe outweighed by those who followed Onaga into what became known as the “All Okinawa” camp. The sense of betrayal stirred the Okinawan anti-base forces to a new level of mobilization. Through 2014, an entire prefecture voted against the national government’s plans (and rejected its blandishments) at successive elections and at multiple levels. In January, Nago City (which includes Henoko and Oura Bays, the designated new base construction site) returned as its mayor the anti-base (“no new base in this city whether on land or on sea”) Inamine Susumu, in the process rejecting the extraordinary offer by the LDP Secretary-General of a 50 billion yen “inducement” fund for Nago City development if only it would elect a pro-base candidate. In September, Nago returned an anti-base majority to the City Assembly. In November, Onaga Takeshi was chosen as Governor by an unprecedentedly large margin (380,820 to 261,076) over the turncoat Nakaima Hirokazu, after pledging to do &#8220;everything in my power&#8221; to stop construction at Henoko, close Futenma Air Base, and have the Marine Corps&#8217; controversial Osprey MV 22 aircraft withdrawn from the prefecture. Then in December all four Okinawan constituencies in the lower house of the Diet returned anti-base candidates in the national elections. It was a decisive democratic rebuff to the government in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Early in 2015, the Okinawa Defense Bureau dropped 49 concrete blocks (each weighing between 10 and 45 tons), into Oura Bay as anchor for the works to come, causing damage to coral that was clear in photographs taken by naturalists and journalists. Onaga ordered them to stop (16 February) but declined to formally cancel the permit for rock and coral crushing issued by his predecessor in August 2014, despite strong urgings from Okinawan civil society and nature protection organizations. Inexplicably, he declared, &#8220;unfortunately it is not possible to make a judgement as to destruction of coral.&#8221;<sup>12</sup> Although works were several times suspended during the year that followed due to fierce continuing Okinawan protest, typhoon weather, and the exigencies of elections, budgetary allocations continued to pass unchallenged, tenders to be let, landfill sought and allocated, workers hired. Abe repeatedly assured the US government that the works would proceed according to his plan, irrespective of Okinawan sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;All Okinawa&#8221; and Governor Onaga, 2014</strong></p>
<p>From December 2014, therefore, Okinawa had a Governor and a prefectural assembly or parliament committed to stopping the construction works at Henoko and restoring Oura Bay. Yet, new governor notwithstanding, prefectural riot police and national Coastguard forces continued to crush protesters and government contractors bore into the bed of Oura Bay.</p>
<p>Onaga’s appeal to Okinawan mass sentiment was based on his &#8220;re-birth&#8221; as an avatar of &#8220;All-Okinawa&#8221; identity politics, transcending the categories of conservative and progressive, &#8220;left&#8221; and &#8220;right,&#8221; and proclaiming the principle of &#8220;identity over ideology.&#8221; Yet, the problem with that “All Okinawa” mantra is that identities are commonly multiple. Okinawan governor Onaga is both implacable opponent of the national government in certain respects and yet in other respects the quintessential, conservative local government Japanese politician. He is not only Okinawan but, like Prime Minister Abe, a lifelong (to 2014) member of the Liberal Democratic Party. While he poses a major challenge, rooted in identity politics, to the government of Japan (and beyond it, to that of the United States), it is not clear how far he can be expected to lead the prefecture down the path of resistance to his conservative colleagues and counterparts at the helm of the nation state. Whether Okinawan identity can trump ideology and generate a credible democratic politics remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Upon taking office as Governor, Onaga was shocked to find that major figures (Prime Minister, Cabinet Secretary, Foreign Minister) refused to see him. Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga said bluntly, &#8220;I have no intention to meet him during [the remainder of] this year.&#8221;<sup>13</sup> Defense Secretary Nakatani said (13 March 2015) it would be “meaningless.” That stance was of course not long tenable, but the hostility it expressed was palpable. At the Henoko site, where the sit-in at the gate of Camp Schwab began in July 2014, protesters were harassed and threatened. <em>Ryukyu shimpo</em> editorialized,</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as we know, the government has never unleashed such reckless disregard of the will of the people as we have seen at Henoko. … We wonder if there has ever been a case like this, where the government has trampled on the will of the overwhelming majority of people in a prefecture elsewhere in Japan. This action by the government evokes memories of the crackdown against peasants during the Edo period. … The Abe government seems to be in the process of moving from &#8216;dictatorship&#8217; to &#8216;terror politics&#8217;.&#8221;<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>The US authorities refused (for &#8220;operational reasons&#8221;) permission to the Governor to enter the site to conduct the survey he had promised to assess damage to the coral from the concrete blocks dropped into the sea-floor, and the government, brushing aside protest, resumed the process. In a particularly egregious act of violence, in March 2015 it sent in riot police to rip away the tent-like protection that had been put in place for a National Sanshin Day performance at Camp Schwab Gate by 20 Okinawan performers (on the Okinawan three-stringed instrument known in Japan as shamisen), leaving them to perform in the rain. On 12 March 2015, it began to bore into the sea floor from a gigantic drilling rig.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Though Onaga&#8217;s support level remains high in Okinawa, there are nagging doubts about how he would reconcile his “All Okinawa” posture with his conservative record. Onaga has limited his differences with Tokyo to two specific demands: closure of Futenma without substitution (i.e., abandonment of the Henoko project), and withdrawal of the MV-22 Osprey aircraft, the subjects of the <em>Kempakusho</em> protest delegation to Tokyo that he led in January 2013. Onaga makes no secret of his support for the US-Japan Security Treaty and the base system (obviously with the exception of the Futenma substitution project), and he was silent during the summer of nation-wide protest against the Abe government’s secrecy and security bills in 2015, suggesting that he supported, or at least did not oppose, Abe’s controversial interpretation of collective self-defense and security legislation package.<sup>16</sup> Onaga also remained silent on the Osprey-pad construction protest at Takae until the summer of 2016, and even then made no visit to the site and no attempt to assert his authority over the riot police who acted in his name, reserving his criticism for the reliance on force, the “excesses” rather than the act itself. When riot police reinforcements were sent from mainland Japan to enforce works at Henoko from late 2015 and at Takae from July 2016 they were sent under the provisions of the National Police Law (1954) at the request of the Prefectural Public Safety Commission, whose members are responsible to and nominated (or dismissed by) the Governor.<sup>17</sup> It is one of the paradoxes of contemporary Okinawan politics that Onaga has not been subjected to any public demand that he attempt to exercise authority over prefectural policing, for example by cancelling or withdrawing the request for such reinforcements. At least in theory, he could dismiss any or all of its five members and appoint others who would represent Okinawan principles.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Onaga could, however, be very forthright in making his prefecture’s case. While Abe and his ministers insisted that the Henoko project amounted to a “burden reduction” for Okinawa, that it was the only way to achieve Futenma return and that it was irreversible, Onaga spoke of an inequitable and increasing burden, building upon the initial illegal seizure of Okinawan land and in defiance of the clearly and often expressed wishes of the Okinawan people; of a struggle for justice and democracy and for the protection of Oura Bay’s extraordinary natural biodiversity, worthy, as he saw it, of World Heritage ranking. Onaga quoted the Okinawa Defense Bureau estimate of more than 5,800 kinds of biota in the Bay zone, (262 of them in danger of extinction), and referred to the sea around Henoko as being twice as rich in biota as the sea around Galapagos,<sup>19</sup> and noted the likely environmental devastation that dumping into the Bay of 3.4 million dump-truck loads (20 million cubic metres) of soil and sand for reclamation would be likely to cause.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>The state under Abe has tended to adopt perverse or arbitrary readings of law and constitution, and in regard to Henoko it has relied on superior force and intimidation. It is certain that no other prefectural governor in Japan would ever refer to the national government in the way that Onaga does, as “condescending,” “unreasonable,” “outrageous,” (<em>rifujin</em>) “childish” (<em>otonagenai</em>) and even “depraved,” (<em>daraku</em>).<sup>21</sup> Before the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva in September 2015, he accused it of “ignoring the people&#8217;s will.”<sup>22</sup> He also complained about the government’s weakness in being “completely lacking in ability to say anything to America.&#8221;<sup>23</sup> To the Prime Minister, Onaga said,</p>
<p>“Construction of Futenma and other bases was carried out after seizure of land and forcible appropriation of residences at point of bayonet and bulldozer, while Okinawan people after the war were still confined in detention centres. Nothing could be more outrageous than [for you] to try to say to Okinawans whose land was taken from them for what is now an obsolescent base [i.e. Futenma], the world’s most dangerous, that they should bear that burden and, if they don’t like it, they should come up with an alternative plan.”<sup>24</sup></p>
<p><strong>Judicial Proceedings (1) The Experts Report</strong> <strong>(2015)</strong></p>
<p>To advise him on the legal and environmental questions arising from the consent given by his predecessor to the reclamation of Oura Bay, Onaga early in 2015 set up an advisory committee of experts, the “Third Party Commission on the Procedure for Approval of Reclamation of Public Waters for the Construction of a Futenma Replacement Airfield,” to identify possible flaws in the legal process that might warrant its cancelation.</p>
<p>The Commission’s report, on 16 July, amounted to an unambiguous finding of multiple procedural “breaches” (<em>kashi</em>) in the way the Nakaima administration had made its crucial December 2013 decision to approve the environmental assessment. It adopted the common expert view of the Henoko environmental impact assessment (EIA) process as &#8220;the worst in the history of Japanese EIA.&#8221;<sup>25</sup> It found that “necessity for reclamation,” a crucial consideration under the 1973 revision to the &#8220;Reclamation of Publicly Owned Water Surfaces Act&#8221; (<em>Koyu suimen umetateho</em>, 1921), had not been established. Of the six specific criteria under Article 4 of that law for reclamation, the Henoko project failed on three. It did not meet the tests of proof of “appropriate and rational use of the national land,” proper consideration for “environmental preservation and disaster prevention,” and compatibility with “legally based plans by the national government or local public organizations regarding land use or environmental conservation.” It was also incompatible with other laws including the Sea Coast Law (1956) and the Basic Law for Biodiversity (2008). In short, the basis of the reclamation project was legally flawed.<sup>26</sup> This opened the path for Onaga to cancel the reclamation license.</p>
<p>Following a one-month (August-September 2015) lull in the Oura Bay confrontation while a round of “talks” was conducted fruitlessly, the government reiterated (through the Minister of Defense) its stance that there had been no “flaw” in the license Nakaima had granted. It therefore ordered site works resumed. Its agents scoured the coastal hills and beaches of Western Japan to identify and place orders for millions of tons of soil and sand to dump into Oura Bay. It also ordered an additional 100-plus riot police (units with names such as “Demon” and “Hurricane”) from Tokyo to reinforce the mostly local Okinawan forces who till then had been imposing the state’s will at the construction site. Eventually, on October 13, Onaga formally revoked (<em>torikeshi</em> or canceled) the reclamation license.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>The national government, its warrant for works removed, temporarily suspended them, but the Okinawa Defense Bureau (OBD) formally complained to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLITT), protesting that there were no flaws in the Nakaima land reclamation approval of December 2013 and that Governor Onaga&#8217;s revocation of it was illegal, asking MLITT to review, suspend, and nullify that order under the Administrative Appeal Act.<sup>28</sup> Onaga presented a 950-page dossier in which he outlined the prefectural case,<sup>29</sup> but, following a cabinet meeting on October 27, MLITT Minister Ishii Keiichi duly suspended the Onaga order on grounds that otherwise it would be &#8220;impossible to continue the relocation&#8221; and because in that event &#8220;the US-Japan alliance would be adversely affected.&#8221;<sup>30</sup> To Governor Onaga, he issued first (October 27) an “advice,” and then, days later (November 6), an “instruction” to withdraw the cancellation order. Onaga refused. On October 29, works at Henoko resumed, the government referring to them as &#8220;main works&#8221; (<em>hontai koji</em>), evidently in order to have them seen as a <em>fait accompli, </em><em>inducing despair and abandonment of the struggle on the part of protesters,</em> even though the boring survey was still at that point incomplete and the outcome of the struggle far from determined.</p>
<p>On 2 November, Onaga launched a prefectural complaint against the Abe government with the Central and Local Government Disputes Management Council, a hitherto relatively insignificant independent review body set up in 2000 by the government&#8217;s Department of General Affairs. That Council took barely six weeks, to 24 December, to dismiss the complaint, without calling upon any evidence. Despite the fact that it would be hard to imagine anything that could better qualify as a dispute between those two wings of government, it ruled, mysteriously, that the complaint was &#8220;beyond the scope of matters it could investigate.&#8221;<sup>31</sup></p>
<p>While this Disputes Council complaint was being heard, on November 17 2015, the national government (through the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, or MLITT) filed suit against the Okinawan government under the Administrative Appeals Act, alleging administrative malfeasance and seeking to have Onaga&#8217;s order set aside and a &#8220;proxy execution&#8221; procedure adopted.</p>
<p>The presiding judge in this &#8220;proxy execution&#8221; suit was Tamiya Toshiro. Tamiya had only taken up office in this court two weeks earlier, on 30 October, following transfer by the Ministry of Justice from the Tokyo High Court.<sup>32</sup> There was speculation that his appointment, weeks before the government’s suit against Governor was lodged, might have been the result of bureaucratic/judicial collusion designed to ensure Okinawan submission to the base construction plan. There was no doubt that the government wanted at all costs to secure a court ruling that would confirm the MLITT minister&#8217;s reinstatement or “proxy execution” of the land reclamation approval. But beyond that, and with Judge Tamiya’s verdict still some weeks away at time of writing, it is impossible to go at this point.</p>
<p>On 25 December, the prefecture launched its counter-suit in the same Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court, seeking to have the October ruling by the Minister set aside. The extraordinary nature of the conflict was thus evident as state and prefectural authorities sued each other over the same matters and in the same Naha court.</p>
<p>The prefecture insisted it was a breach of its constitutional entitlement to self-government for the state to impose the Henoko construction project on it unilaterally and by force. Onaga pointed to what he saw, on expert advice, as fatal flaws in the land reclamation approval process. He objected to the ODB&#8217;s use of the Administrative Appeal Act, for which purpose the state was pretending to be just like a &#8220;private person&#8221; (<em>ichishijin</em>) complaining under a law specifically designed to allow individual citizens to seek redress against unjustified or illegal acts by governmental agencies, and noted that, while the state sought relief as an aggrieved citizen it deployed its full powers and prerogatives <em>as state</em> under the Local Self-Government Law to sweep aside prefectural self-government and assume the right to proxy execution of an administrative act (<em>gyosei daishikko</em>). The state was in his view thus adopting a perverse and arbitrary reading of the law.</p>
<p>The state, for its part, argued that base matters were its prerogative, having nothing to do with local self-government, and being a matter of treaty obligations were not subject to any constitutional barrier. Abe spoke repeatedly of “Futenma return,” but only on condition that there was a substitute, and the substitute had to be in Okinawa, and in Okinawa at Henoko. That new base would be more multi-functional, more modern, and almost certainly permanent but, by his reasoning, its building would amount to a &#8220;burden reduction&#8221; for Okinawa.</p>
<p>Tamiya rejected applications by the prefecture to call expert witnesses on military and defense matters (who might dispute the need for a Marine Corps presence in Okinawa) or on the environment or environmental assessment law (who might challenge the compatibility of Okinawa&#8217;s unique bio-diversity with large-scale reclamation and militarization). The matter on which his court showed strong, even exceptional, interest was the securing of an explicit statement from Governor Onaga that he would abide by its ruling.<sup>33</sup> In proceedings before the Tamiya court six months later (discussed below) this same pattern was apparent.</p>
<p><strong>Judicial Proceedings (2)<em> Wakai/</em>Conciliation (2016)</strong></p>
<p>As the flurry of writs and interrogatories continued, and the tense and sometimes violent confrontation continued between state power and protesting citizens at the reclamation/construction site, it was hard to imagine where ground for compromise might be found. Yet that is precisely what Chief Justice Tamiya ordered when, on January 29, 2016, he advised the disputing parties in the suit launched by the Government of Japan against Governor Onaga to consider an out-of-court settlement. He began with the following exhortation:<sup>34</sup></p>
<p>&#8220;At present the situation is one of confrontation between Okinawa and the Government of Japan. So far as the cause of this is concerned, before any consideration of which is at fault both sides should reflect that it should not be like this. Under the 1999 revision to the Local Autonomy Law it was envisaged that the state and regional public bodies would serve their respective functions as <em>independent administrative bodies in an equal, cooperative relationship </em>(italics added)<em>.</em> That is especially desirable in the performance of statutory or entrusted matters. The present situation is at odds with the spirit of this revised law.</p>
<p>The situation that in principle should exist is for all Japan, including Okinawa, to come to an agreement on a solution and to seek the cooperation of the United States. If they did this, it could become the occasion for positive cooperation on the part of the US too, including broad reform.<sup>35</sup></p>
<p>Instead, if the issue continues to be contested before the courts, and even if the state wins the present judicial action, hereafter it may be foreseen that the reclamation license might be rescinded or that approval of changes accompanying modification of the design would become necessary, and that the courtroom struggle would continue indefinitely. Even then there could be no guarantee that it would be successful. In such a case, as the Governor&#8217;s wide discretionary powers come to be recognized, the risk of defeat is high. And, even if the state continued to win, the works are likely to be considerably delayed. On the other hand, even if the prefecture wins, if it turns out that the state would not ask for Futenma return because it insists that Henoko construction is the only way forward, then it is inconceivable that Okinawa by itself could negotiate with the US and secure Futenma&#8217;s return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tamiya thus rebuked and warned the state that, unless it fundamentally changed its strategy, it was heading towards defeat. In particular he focussed attention on the 1999 revision to the Local Autonomy Act that turned the national-prefectural government relationship from instrumental (vertical, superior/inferior) to equal and cooperative<em>.</em> Tamiya went on to urge the parties to &#8220;conciliate&#8221; (<em>wakai</em>), offering two alternatives, &#8220;basic&#8221; and &#8220;provisional.&#8221; The “basic” solution would have Okinawa reverse its withdrawal of the reclamation permit in exchange for the Japanese government opening negotiations with the U.S. to have the new base</p>
<p>“either returned to Japan or converted into a joint military-civilian airport at some point within thirty years from the time it becomes operational.&#8221;</p>
<p>The inclusion of provisos for the defendant [prefecture] and the plaintiff [the state] to cooperate in the reclamation and subsequent operation [of the base] meant that this plan was predicated on the contested base at Henoko actually being built and provided to the Marine Corps, probably until at least the year 2045 (or indeed much longer, because there could be no guarantee as to how the Government of the United States would respond to any Japanese request at such a remote future date). There was nothing conciliatory or amicable about it. It was hard to see in such ideas any inkling of a solution. Nakasone Isamu, himself a retired judge, noted,</p>
<p>“the success or failure of diplomatic negotiation with the United States is contingent on the cooperation of a third party, namely the United States. In other words, the paragraph does not describe something that the Japanese government has the authority to execute freely. Thus it fails to adhere to the requisites of a term of settlement, and thus the settlement proposal as a whole lacks validity from a legal standpoint.”<sup>36</sup></p>
<p>Under the “provisional” plan the state would stop site works, and the parties open talks towards a satisfactory resolution (<em>enman kaiketsu</em>) pending outcome of a judicial determination, which both parties would respect and implement. If the talks failed to achieve a solution, the government would then file a different, less legally forceful type of lawsuit to verify the legality of the permit withdrawal.</p>
<p>Although it was hard to see how negotiations in 2016 would accomplish more than the &#8220;intensive negotiations&#8221; of August-September 2015, or how fresh court proceedings would overcome the problems the judge himself alluded to, on 4 March the parties came, as directed by Tamiya, to an &#8220;out-of-court&#8221; or “amicable” (<em>wakai</em>) settlement.<sup>37</sup> Site works were halted, both parties withdrew their existing suits under the Administrative Appeals Act and the state agreed to ask the prefecture under Article 25 of the Local Autonomy Act to cancel the order cancelling the reclamation license and agree to the matter being referred to the Central and Local Government Disputes Management Council in the event of its declining. Clearly Tamiya’s court saw such a suit as more appropriate to the formally equal relationship between the parties than the execution-by-proxy suit that the Abe government had chosen. The parties would discuss and seek &#8220;satisfactory resolution&#8221; pending the final outcome of judicial proceedings, and both would then abide by whatever outcome then emerged.</p>
<p>The fact that Judge Tamiya combined formal, procedural critique of the Abe government&#8217; with support for its case, evident in this recommendation of a &#8220;solution&#8221; that involved construction of the very base that Okinawans were determined to stop, held ominous implications for the prefecture. The barb in the “Amicable Agreement” was the superficially innocuous &#8220;sincerity&#8221; provision eventually incorporated in Paragraph 9, designed to remove any possible further recourse to the courts once the Supreme Court comes to its decision. It read:</p>
<p>&#8220;The complainant and other interested parties and the defendant reciprocally pledge that, after the judgment in the suit for cancellation of the rectification order becomes final, they will immediately comply with that judgment and carry out procedures in accord with the ruling and its grounds, and also that thereafter they will mutually cooperate and sincerely respond to the spirit of the ruling.&#8221;<sup>38</sup></p>
<p>Challenged in the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly on 8 March 2016 as to what this commitment to &#8220;cooperate and sincerely respond to the spirit of the ruling&#8221; meant, Governor Onaga explained his understanding that, although his October 2015 order might thereby be cancelled, and the Nakaima license restored, in respect of all other matters he would make &#8220;appropriate judgement in accord with the law.&#8221;<sup>39</sup> He did not go into detail, but that would seem to mean that, even if defeated in court, he could still resort to his ultimate sanction &#8211; repeal of the Nakaima reclamation license (<em>umetate shonin tekkai</em>), going beyond the &#8220;cancelation&#8221; order he had issued in October 2014. Not only that but he could, and evidently would, refuse or obstruct requests from the state for detailed adjustments to the reclamation plan or engineering design.<sup>40</sup> Nago City mayor Inamine has also made it clear on many occasions that he would follow suit.</p>
<p>Since the March 4 &#8220;amicable settlement” was drawn up and agreed in accord with court directives, it was neither &#8220;out-of-court&#8221; nor a &#8220;settlement.&#8221; Nor was there anything “amicable” about it. Under it the government shifted its case against Okinawa from the Administrative Appeals Act, where its position was procedurally weak, to the Local Government Act, where it might be stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Judicial Proceedings (3) “Out of Court”</strong></p>
<p>However, no sooner had the &#8220;Amicable Settlement&#8221; with Okinawa promising those &#8220;discussions aimed at satisfactory resolution&#8221; been reached than Prime Minister Abe insisted anew that Henoko was &#8220;the only option,&#8221; implying that there was nothing to negotiate but Okinawa&#8217;s surrender.<sup>41</sup> Just three days after agreeing to engage in discussions, and without so much as a preliminary meeting, MLITT Minister Ishii (for the government) sent Governor Onaga a formal request that he retract his cancellation of the Oura Bay reclamation license (i.e. that he restore the license granted by Nakaima in December 2013). It was exactly as prescribed under Paragraph 3 of the agreement, committing the parties to proceed in accord with Article 245 of the Local Autonomy Law, but it was plainly at odds with the prescription under Paragraph 8: that they negotiate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until such time as a finalized court judgement on the proceedings for cancellation of the rectification order is issued, the plaintiff and other interested parties and the defendant will undertake discussions aimed at &#8216;satisfactory resolution&#8217; (<em>enman kaiketsu</em>) of the Futenma airfield return and the current [Henoko] reclamation matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>On March 14, Governor Onaga responded, refusing. He pointed out that the Government had given no reason for its request and therefore his cancellation order could not be seen as a breach of the law.<sup>42</sup> Submitting the matter to the Disputes Management Council, he referred to Ishii&#8217;s act as &#8220;an illegal intervention by the state.&#8221;<sup>43</sup> It was, he said, a &#8220;pity&#8221; that the government had seen fit to issue such a Rectification Order immediately after entering the Amicable Agreement.</p>
<p>The five-member Disputes Management Council, since its establishment in 2000 had only twice been called upon to adjudicate a dispute and on neither occasion – both matters of relatively minor importance – had it issued any ruling against the government.<sup>44</sup> It was an unlikely avenue for resolution of a major dispute between national and regional governments especially since it had abstained from doing so just months earlier, in December 2015, without so much as a statement of its reasons.</p>
<p>While the national government insisted there was no alternative to Henoko construction, Onaga told the Dispute Resolution Council that the project was “a monumental idiocy likely to cause a treasure of humanity to vanish from the earth.”<sup>45</sup> There was little or no room for compromise between the prefecture’s argument that the Nakaima consent to reclamation was wrongful because it failed to meet the requirements of the Reclamation Act and the state’s argument that reclamation was within its powers because it had exclusive responsibility for defense and foreign relations.</p>
<p>The Council, however, on June 17, 2016 delivered an astonishing judgement: unanimously, it refused to rule on the legitimacy of MLITT Minster Ishii’s March order to the Okinawan Governor. The panel head, Kobayakawa Mitsuo, told a press conference,</p>
<p>“We thought issuing either a positive or a negative judgement on the rectification order would not be beneficial in helping the state and local governments create desirable relations.”<sup>46</sup></p>
<p>The panel lamented the “continuing undesirable” state of relations between state and prefecture, and urged “sincere discussions” to reach agreement.<sup>47</sup> Since it issued no ruling, it meant that Governor Onaga’s cancelation order remained in place, and that site works could not be resumed. In that sense it might be seen as a victory for the prefecture. But the constitutional problem was left: if a Commission especially set up to decide on disputes between national and regional governments could not resolve them, who or what could?</p>
<p><strong>Judicial Proceedings (4) Back to Judge Tamiya’s Court</strong></p>
<p>With the door thus closed by the Disputes Management Council, on July 22, the national government filed a fresh suit with the Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court (i.e. Judge Tamiya’s court), seeking a ruling that the Okinawan government comply with the MLITT minister’s order and amend (reverse) its revocation of permission for landfill work on Oura Bay. It declared that it had already submitted its detailed case on grounds of foreign affairs and defence policy in the previous hearings and would not repeat it. It made no reference to Judge Tamiya’s injunction that central and regional government bodies perform “their respective functions as <em>independent administrative bodies in an equal, cooperative relationship.” </em>Nor did it mention his call for resolution of their differences by negotiation. It thus turned its back on the conciliation process ordered by Tamiya’s court when in January it called for:</p>
<p>“all Japan, including Okinawa, to come to an agreement on a solution and to seek the cooperation of the United States. If they did this, it could become the occasion for positive cooperation on the part of the US too, including broad reform.”</p>
<p>And likewise on the Disputes Council’s call for “sincere negotiations.” Its position that there was no alternative to Henoko construction and therefore nothing to negotiate bordered on contempt of court, and presented a dilemma for Judge Tamiya. As the <em>Asahi Shimbun</em> noted in March, the Abe government’s actions</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;suggest the arrogance that comes from regarding Okinawa as an inferior, despite the High Court&#8217;s statement that the central government and all local governments are &#8216;equals&#8217;.&#8221;<sup>48</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>As for Okinawa, through its Governor and its Prefectural Assembly, its parliament, and through repeated mass gatherings of its citizens, as well as through its panel of lawyers in the Naha court, it made clear that it accepts, indeed embraces, the principle of equality enunciated by Tamiya and that, as an equal, it rules out any new base construction on its territory. Governor Onaga insisted (5 August) that he had exercised his authority properly and that there was no reason why he should submit to a contrary, improper “rectification” directive from the state. At issue, he insisted, were “fundamentals of regional self-government and by extension fundamentals of democracy.”<sup>49</sup></p>
<p>Tamiya, undoubtedly under pressure from the government, adopted an extraordinarily fast “speed trial” schedule. From issue of the writs on July 22 there were just two open days of hearings (5 and 19 August), with verdict to be announced on 16 September. Tamiya dismissed the prefecture’s request to call eight expert witnesses (including Mayor Inamine of Nago City), and gave Onaga himself short shrift, again repeatedly asking him to confirm that he would obey the ruling of the court (a highly irregular query from the bench, according to lawyers present).<sup>50</sup></p>
<p>Tamiya will rule on these vexing matters on 16 September. Whichever side “loses” at that stage is certain to appeal to the Supreme Court. Even then, however far from necessarily signifying an end to the problem that presumed &#8220;final&#8221; and &#8220;irreversible&#8221; judgement might simply spark a more intense level of political and social crisis, affecting in turn the Japan-US relationship and the frame of regional order. One of Okinawa&#8217;s most respected figures, the prize-winning novelist Medoruma Shun, who as a Henoko canoeist has formed part of the non-violent civic blockade designed to block reclamation works, commented,<sup>51</sup></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It seems very unlikely that the Henoko new base construction problem can be solved solely by the administration, the law, or the parliament. Public opposition will keep delaying the construction. And the Japanese government will probably only give up on construction if public protest extends beyond Camp Schwab to US bases throughout the prefecture, and comes to affect the functioning of Kadena Air Base &#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That, Medoruma adds, is a far from impossible prospect.</p>
<p>Judicial precedents are not encouraging for Okinawa. In December 1959, the Supreme Court held in the &#8220;Sunagawa case&#8221; that matters pertaining to the security treaty with the US are &#8220;highly political&#8221; and concern Japan&#8217;s very existence, so that the judiciary should not pass judgement on them. That ruling, on expansion of the existing US base at Tachikawa (outside Tokyo), in effect elevated the Security Treaty above the constitution and immunized it from any challenge at law, thus entrenching the US base presence. It would be surprising if the 2016 (or 2017) court, addressing the project to create a new base at Henoko, did not follow this precedent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is just 20 years since then Okinawan Governor Ota Masahide (Governor 1990-1998) was arraigned before the Supreme Court facing the demand by the Prime Minister that he exercise his duties of state under the Local Self-Government Law to sign the proxy lease agreements on privately owned land appropriated by the US military (which he had refused to do). Ota made an eloquent plea, but the court dismissed it, contemptuously, in a two-sentence judgement.<sup>52</sup> For Ota, the Supreme Court ruling was the last word. He submitted and signed the proxy lease agreements.</p>
<p>In the case of civil suits too, by Okinawan citizens and civic groups against the government of Japan, the record points to similar judicial inclination to endorse the state, dismissing the Okinawan case against it. One long-running (2009-2014) suit brought by a citizen group to have the environmental impact study on Henoko reopened because of its being fundamentally unscientific was dismissed at both initial hearing and later on appeal, the latter judgement so brief that it took just 30 seconds to read out. Other long-running suits have been pursued against the government over the intolerable levels of noise and nuisance emanating from the US bases. Between 2002 and 2015, courts have issued altogether seven judgements on this matter, repeatedly accepting evidence (in the words of the most recent judgement of Naha District Court in June 2015) that the 2200 plaintiffs of Ginowan City did indeed suffer &#8220;mental distress, poor sleep, and disruption to their daily lives&#8221; from &#8220;serous and widespread&#8221; violations that &#8220;could not be defended on any ground of public interest&#8221; and that they should therefore be paid 754 million yen (approximately $9 million) compensation. Courts have, however, refused to order a stop to that nuisance. By so doing, in effect they concede that the US military is beyond and above the law, and that the government of Japan is complicit in enforcing its ongoing illegality and the accompanying suffering of its people. As <em>Ryukyu shimpo</em> commented, &#8220;how could a government that enforces continuing illegality upon the citizens of one of its regions be considered a law-ruled state?&#8221;<sup>53</sup></p>
<p><strong>Confrontation </strong></p>
<p>While court battles engage a small army of lawyers and officials, it is the citizen engagement on the front lines, at Henoko and Takae, that best embodies the Okinawan spirit. Despite being relatively remote and difficult of access from major population centers, especially in the early mornings, Henoko has become one of the longest sit-in protests of modern times, sustaining a ten-year protest encampment at the fishing harbour which saw off the first design for a floating heliport base in 2005 and then continued till July 2015, when it was joined by the encampment at the gate to Camp Schwab marine base, a couple of kilometres from the fishing harbour. From July 2014, this Schwab-gate site became the main access route to the construction site. Core protesters are often supplemented by “All Okinawa” chartered buses bringing volunteers from throughout the island. On an average day, the core group may be between sixty and one hundred or so protesters, but on special occasions many more, as on the 500<sup>th</sup> day of the Camp Schwab Gate camp, 18 November 2015, that attracted over 1,000. The impromptu exchange of experience and ideas, interspersed with performances of song or dance, grew during 2016 to such extent that the gathering declared itself “Henoko University” and organized a series of “lectures” by activists and scholars.</p>
<p>While the citizenry remained resolutely non-violent and exercised the right of civil disobedience only after exhausting all legal and constitutional steps to oppose the base project, the National Coastguard and Riot Police flaunted their violence, dragging away protesters (quite a few of whom are in their 70s and 80s), dunking canoeists in the sea, pinning down one protest ship captain till he lost consciousness, and on a number of occasions causing injuries to protesters requiring hospital treatment.<sup>54</sup> <sup> </sup>On 20 November 2014, 85 year old Shimabukuro Fumiko (a Battle of Okinawa survivor) was carried off to hospital from the Camp Schwab protest gathering suffering a suspected concussion. On the following day journalists from the Okinawan daily <em>Ryukyu shimpo</em> were manhandled, abused and forcibly removed from the site. On 20 January 2015, a Coastguard officer gripped a woman film maker around the neck with his legs (a &#8220;horse riding&#8221; assault) intent on wrenching away her camera. Protesting canoeists and kayakers were intimidated and driven off or on occasion dumped at sea, as far as four kilometres from shore, after being held for varying periods.</p>
<p>On 22 February 2016, just before the opening of a mass protest meeting at the gate of Camp Schwab, local Japanese security agents for the US Marine Corps arrested three protesters, including the head of the Okinawa Peace Movement Centre, Yamashiro Hiroji, on suspicion of breaching the special criminal law (adopted in 1952 at the height of the Korean War to prescribe stringent punishment for unauthorized entry or attempted entry into US bases in Japan). Film footage showed Yamashiro, ordering demonstrators to be especially careful not to cross the boundary line, being suddenly attacked, flung to the ground, handcuffed, and dragged feet-first into the base by US Marine Corps security personnel. As the <em>Okinawa Times</em> noted, it appeared to be a clear case in which the constitutional right to freedom of assembly, opinion, and expression had been sacrificed to the overarching extraterritorial rights enjoyed by the US.<sup>55</sup> For Okinawans, it suggested a return to the lawless 1950s when US forces confiscated land and constructed bases at will (under “bayonet and bulldozer”), and treated Okinawans with violence and contempt. Two months later, on 1 April 2016, the prize-winning novelist, Medoruma Shun, was pulled from his kayak and held, first by US and then by Japanese authorities, for a total of 34 hours under the stringent Special Criminal Law – as if he were planning to attack the base.<sup>56</sup></p>
<p>As these matters were prominently reported in the Okinawan (but barely mentioned in the mainland) media, Abe’s close friend and his appointee (in 2013) to the board of governors of Japan&#8217;s public broadcasting corporation, NHK, the novelist Hyakuta Naoki, expressed the view that the two Okinawan newspapers (<em>Ryukyu shimpo</em> and <em>Okinawa Times</em>) should be closed down because they express “traitorous” views.<sup>57</sup></p>
<p>Even as the confrontation continued and deepened at the Henoko site, the government strove to “buy off” opposition where it could. Since Nago City had from 2010 twice returned a mayor and local assembly majority that resisted all attempts at suasion and refused to accept any monies linked to it, Abe, Shimajiri, and other members of government worked to find ways to divide and weaken the city’s anti-base movement. Late in October, the heads of three of the city’s 55 sub-districts (<em>ku</em>) &#8211; Henoko, Kushi and Toyohara (population respectively 2014, 621, and 427) &#8211; were invited to the Prime Minister’s office in Tokyo. They set out their wish list, asking for repairs to the local community halls, purchase of lawnmowers, and provision of one (or perhaps several) “azumaya” (a kind of summer-house or gazebo).<sup>58</sup> They were told they were to be allocated the sum of 13 million yen each in the 2016 budget, a subsidy that would bypass the representative institutions of the city and prefecture. It was to be (as Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga later put it), “compensation” for the noise and nuisance caused them by the protest movement.</p>
<p>Suga declared that the local <em>ku</em> districts “agreed” to the Henoko construction albeit with some strings attached, and suggested it was only natural that they be given every encouragement. However, within weeks, all three heads contradicted him, saying he had misunderstood them. The head of Kushi insisted that the district had not changed its opposition to Henoko base construction since taking that position in 1997, and the head of Toyohara stated that “absolutely no-one in Toyohara” wanted a base.<sup>59</sup></p>
<p>It was a trifling enough sum (less than half a million dollars in all), but the appropriation of public funds, with no accountability, to encourage a cooperative, base-tolerant spirit in a few corners of a stubbornly anti-base city was, as <em>Ryukyu shimpo</em> put it, an “unprecedented politics of division.&#8221;<sup>60</sup> It was also an almost certainly illegal attempt to evade democratic will and constitutional procedure.<sup>61</sup></p>
<p><strong>Elections, 2016</strong></p>
<p>In 2016, while the contest continued and intensified at Camp Schwab gate and in the courts, three important elections were held: in January for mayor of Ginowan City, in June for the Okinawan Prefectural Assembly, and in July for the upper house (House of Councillors) in the national diet. In the second and third of these, Tokyo-supported candidates were soundly defeated, an “All Okinawa” majority supporting the Governor was confirmed in the prefectural assembly, and in the Upper House of the Diet one of the best-known opponents of base substitution within Okinawa, Iha Yoichi, (Ginowan mayor for two terms, 2003-2010) was chosen by a huge majority over the Abe government’s favourite (and from late 2015 actually Minister for Okinawa), Shimajiri Aiko. The margin of defeat, 100,000 votes, signified her humiliation. Both of these may be considered “All Okinawa” victories.</p>
<p>In Ginowan City the outcome was more nuanced.<sup>62</sup> The Abe government’s anointed candidate, the incumbent Sakima Atsushi, had been elected to the office in 2012 on a “no new base for Okinawa” pledge but, like Shimajiri, was party to a collective Okinawan “<em>tenko</em>” (conversion under pressure) the following year, abandoning his campaign political pledge and switching to favour construction of the “Futenma replacement facility” at Henoko. In the January 2016 election, he defeated the “All Okinawa” candidate, Shimura Keiichiro, by a comfortable margin, 27,668 to 21,811. Prime Minister Abe declared himself &#8220;greatly encouraged&#8221; and said he would &#8220;continue efforts at dialogue in order to lessen the burden on Okinawa and promote its development.&#8221;<sup>63</sup> But the outcome can scarcely be seen as an Abe victory since both candidates promised to secure reversion of Futenma, Sakima within three years (by 2019) and Shimura within five years (by 2021). The victorious Sakima did not so much as mention the word “Henoko” during his campaign (the only difference in their speeches was Shimura’s phrase “without allowing any new base to be built”) and both he and his Abe government supporters must have known full well that there would be no Futenma return within either three or five years. Sakima made one other campaign promise, to attract a “Disneyland” to the City, but it was equally unrealistic, and was dismissed as pipedream by Disneyland (Oriental Land Company) executives shortly after the election. There would be no Futenma return within three (or five) years and no Ginowan City Disneyland ever.</p>
<p>Apart from consistently returning anti-base candidates, Okinawa showed itself unforgiving of candidates who, once elected on an anti-Henoko base construction platform, then reversed themselves. Most notable in this category is Nakaima Hirokazu (Governor 2006-2014), (re-) elected in 2010 on an anti-base platform who famously “turned coat” during a week secreted in a Tokyo hospital in December 2013. In the subsequent November 2014 gubernatorial election he was resoundingly dismissed by the electorate. Likewise, Upper House member Shimajiri Aiko, elected in 2010 on an anti-base platform who “turned coat” in April 2013 and later that same year led the “surrender” of conservative Diet members. She was highly appreciated in Abe circles not only for her role in orchestrating the crucial 2013 reversal but for the views she expressed later: calling for the Riot Police and Coastguard to be mobilized to curb the “illegal, obstructionist activities” of the anti-base movement (February 2014), denouncing Nago mayor Inamine for &#8220;abusing his power (April 2015), and referring contemptuously to the &#8220;irresponsible citizens&#8217; movement&#8221; (October 2015). With such views, she rose meteorically in the Tokyo establishment, becoming Minister for Okinawa in the third Abe cabinet (with responsibilities that included also the Northern Territories, science and technology, space, oceans, territorial problems, IT, and “cool Japan”). But to rise in Tokyo is to fall in Okinawa, and in July 2016 Okinawans dismissed her by a massive 100,000 vote margin.<sup>64</sup></p>
<p><strong>Futenma – Reversion?</strong></p>
<p>Already twenty years have passed since 1996 when Tokyo and Washington first promised Futenma return &#8220;within 5 to 7 years,&#8221; i.e., by 2003. In December 2013, Prime Minister Abe promised Governor Nakaima to accomplish it by February 2019, but when Abe conveyed this request to Washington in February 2014, Marine Commander Wissler explicitly ruled it out.<sup>65</sup> In the Ginowan City mayoral election of January 2016 the Abe-supported conservative candidate gave that same date as his pledge to the city. Already by then, however, at the inter-governmental (US-Japan) level the date for completion and handover of the new facility had been set as &#8220;no earlier than 2022.&#8221;<sup>66</sup> In 2016, as the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the original agreement passed, the Marine Corps&#8217; “Marine Aviation Plan 2016&#8243; pushed it further back to fiscal year 2025 (October 2024-September 2025).<sup>67</sup> Admiral Harry Harris, Commander-of US Pacific forces, gave that date in evidence to Congress early in 2016.<sup>68</sup> Harris noted that, of 200 base transfer-related items carried in Japan&#8217;s 2015 budget, just nine had been completed, eight were still underway, and the situation at the Henoko site was not improving but rather protest was &#8220;continuing to escalate.&#8221;<sup>69</sup></p>
<p>But even as that date was being reluctantly accepted by the Marine Corps and Congress, at the beginning of March 2016, Japan despatched its top security official, Yachi Shotaro, to Washington to seek the Obama government&#8217;s understanding for a further substantial delay.<sup>70</sup> Only after the US consented did the Abe government come to an &#8220;out-of-court&#8221; March 4 agreement (with Okinawa Prefecture) that involved a complete and indefinite suspension of site works at Henoko. Lt. General Robert Neller, commander of the US Marine Corps, told a Senate military affairs committee meeting that the <em>wakai </em>suspension could be expected to last a further 12-months.<sup>71</sup> President Obama, advised of the impending delay, is said to have responded with &#8220;So there will be nothing happening for a while then.&#8221;<sup>72</sup></p>
<p>It means that the Government of Japan has promised the Government of the United States that Henoko works will resume around February 2017, for a base that will be completed and handed over to the Marine Corps around 2026. Even for that to happen, somehow in the remaining months it must extract the legal warrant to resume works at Henoko. Given the well-demonstrated ability of the protest movement to delay and obstruct construction of the new base, even 2026 could prove a conservative estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Takae – Reversion?</strong></p>
<p>Takae deserves a special place in any consideration of the Okinawa struggle. Like Henoko, its travails date to 1996. Under the agreement of that year, as condition for the return of about half of the Marine Corps’ Camp Gonsalves’ Jungle Warfare Center in the Yambaru forest, six &#8220;Helicopter Landing Pads&#8221; were to be constructed. Only after completion of the environmental impact study (2007-2012) did the government reveal that they would be used, not by the conventional CH 46 helicopter but the ear-crushingly noisy and dangerous vertical takeoff and landing “Osprey.” When the residents of Takae village (population ca 150) began a roadside protest in 2007, the government resorted to various devices, including &#8220;SLAPP&#8221;-type restraining court orders against it.<sup>73</sup> In February 2015 Japan handed over to the Marine Corps in advance two completed Osprey pads. As it did so, the Higashi Village Assembly adopted unanimously a resolution declaring that the Osprey-pad construction contravened the wishes of the local community and banning US aircraft from using them. Days later, on 25 February 2015, the Marine Corps&#8217; Osprey appeared at the site and began training flights. From the start, it was flying roughly twice as often as the CH-46 it replaced.<sup> 74</sup> By June 2016, the Okinawa Defense Bureau reported that the especially aggravating night flights had increased 8-fold over 2014, to 400 that month.<sup>75</sup> These were especially terrifying when conducted without lights. When the Noguchigera woodpecker began to die mysteriously, some suspected that the avian nervous system too could not cope with the disturbance to their world brought by the Osprey.<sup>76</sup> But the US military enjoyed priority over all the forest dwellers, not only human but animal, avian, insect or botanical.</p>
<p>The once peaceful, bio-diverse, forested environment became a virtual war zone. A local newspaper conducted a door-to-door survey of opinion among local residents and found opposition running at 80 per cent, with not one soul in favour.<sup>77</sup></p>
<p>On 22 July 2016, weeks after the Upper House election in which the Abe government’s key Okinawa policy person, Shimajiri Aiko, was humiliated, the government launched a full-scale assault on Takae (following prolonged suspension of operations partly to avoid disturbing forest birds during breeding time and partly to avoid political damage in the forthcoming Upper House election), mobilizing a small army of over 500 riot police from various parts of mainland Japan to lay siege to the 150-person population of Takae, creating in effect a “law-less” zone.<sup>78</sup> This Abe “army” aimed to crush the Okinawan resistance at a point where it was most difficult to mount, sweeping aside the Takae protest tents and vehicles and periodically closing or limiting traffic on Highway 70.<sup>79</sup> As <em>Ryukyu shimpo</em> pointed out, it was the sort of mobilization of force with which a major assault on a yakuza gangster headquarters might be launched.<sup>80</sup> For the people carrying on the resistance year after year, mostly small farmers, the experience of being overwhelmed by state force, outnumbered roughly 5:1, was “akin to martial law” as novelist Medoruma put it.<sup>81</sup> Late in August 2016, the 87 year-old Shimabukuro Fumiko, front-line heroine of the Okinawan resistance, was carried off to hospital for a second time after falling in the melee at Takae.</p>
<p>For the first time, the prefectural parliament, the Prefectural Assembly, adopted a resolution calling for immediate halt to the works.<sup>82</sup> The American veterans’ organization, the 3,000-strong Veterans for Peace, issued a statement from its Berkeley California annual meeting denouncing the action to crush demonstrators at Takae.</p>
<p>“Whereas, on July 22, reportedly as many as 800 riot police, collected from all over Japan, swarmed into the tiny village of Takae (which is surrounded by a sub-tropical forest that could qualify as a world heritage site), tore down their tents and towed away their cars, reaffirming that the Government views Okinawa as a colony …”</p>
<p>and urging the US government to distance itself from such repressive, shameful acts.<sup>83</sup></p>
<p><strong>Frontier Islands</strong></p>
<p>The problem of Okinawa’s Frontier or Southwest (Sakishima or Nansei) islands has to be understood in the same frame as the &#8220;Okinawa problem&#8221; and the &#8220;Henoko problem.&#8221; As noted above, these islands were assigned to China in the draft Sino-Japanese treaty of 1880, only remaining in Japan’s hands because China had second thoughts. Throughout the Cold War, the 600 kilometre chain of Southwest Japanese islands stretching through the East China Sea from Naha to Taiwan remained peaceful and stable, with no significant military presence despite the Cold War. Yonaguni was as much &#8220;offshore&#8221; from Taiwan and China in the East China Sea as from Japan, and it relied on two policemen, a hand-gun apiece, to keep order.<sup>84</sup></p>
<p>From the time of the Democratic Party governments of 2009-2012 the commitment to establish a military presence on these islands has been part of a bipartisan security consensus, especially following the 2010 incidents at sea between Japan and China over the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands (for administrative purposes part of the Okinawan Yaeyama Island group). As in Henoko and Takae, for these islands too national policy exigency overrides all other considerations.</p>
<p>In the midst of a booming region, Yonaguni suffers population attrition and economic decline because of the lack of direct transport or communications links with either Taiwan or China. Populated half a century ago by over 10,000 people but now a mere 1,500, uniquely in Japan it has twice in the past decade formally debated its collective future, in 2004-5 and in 2008-2015. In 2005, it formulated a &#8220;Vision&#8221; for a future based on regional (East China Sea) cooperation and open door trade, fishing and tourism link with Taiwan, but Tokyo forbade it. Then, following a US naval intelligence-gathering visit to the island in 2007, a different, even opposite, idea of a military centred future began to gather attention. A petition to urge a base presence was organized in 2008 by a local &#8220;Defense Association.&#8221; In June 2009, the Yonaguni mayor, Hokama Shukichi, approached the Ministry of Defense and the Ground Self-Defense Forces to suggest they set up a base on the island. There followed a series of elections, referenda, and bitterly divisive campaigns contested by pro- and anti-base forces. The matter was eventually resolved by the narrow election victory of the pro-base mayor in June 2013 (553:506) followed by a “Yes” to the SDF in an island referendum in February 2015 (632:445). Early in 2016, the base was ready and the Ground Self Defense Force (GSDF) unit marched in.</p>
<p>Fatigue from years of bitter struggle in the small, close-knit island community played a large role in the outcome. Many were discouraged by the silence of Governor Onaga. They had assumed, following his victory in November 2014 that he would incorporate the island within his general “All Okinawa” anti-base camp. Without external support, and knowing that Minister of Defense Nakatani Gen had said that construction was going to proceed irrespective of the 2015 poll result, it seemed futile for a few hundred islanders to attempt to resist the determined central government. Still, 41 per cent of islanders did return a “No” vote, showing that divisions in the community remained deep. As the GSDF began its surveillance of Chinese shipping and other communications, islanders could be sure that they had at least earned a place on the Chinese missile target list. Those who remember the consequences of an Okinawan role in defence of “mainland” Japan in 1945 contemplate the new arrangements with deep misgivings.</p>
<p>Some in the other Japanese SDF services (Air and Maritime) suspected that &#8220;turf&#8221; considerations were a major factor behind the GSDF deployment to Yonaguni (and other frontier islands), compensating for the loss of role in Hokkaido where, through the Cold War, they prepared for a putative land attack by Soviet forces. In the post-Cold War, post-War on Terror era, the South-West was the growth area for Japan&#8217;s military. Apart from Yonaguni, Miyako was targeted for an 800-strong security and missile force, with another 500 likely to be sent to Amami Oshima in Kagoshima prefecture.<sup>85</sup> 500-more had been ear-marked for Ishigaki Island, where the conservative mayor is known to be supportive and Maritime SDF ships welcomed.<sup>86</sup></p>
<p><strong>Outlook </strong></p>
<p>Okinawan people’s faith in justice and democracy has been sorely tested ever since its “reversion” to Japan under a secret deal over 40 years ago in which Okinawan opinion was ignored and the prosecution of the US war in Southeast Asia prioritized. However many times and in however many different forums Okinawans insist that no new base be allowed, it makes no difference. Construction of the Henoko base and the &#8220;Osprey pads&#8221; designed to accommodate them, is a core national policy, and the key <em>raison d&#8217;être</em>for Okinawa in the eyes of Tokyo is as a joint US-Japan bastion projecting force where required for the regional and global hegemonic project.</p>
<p>The role of “base island” long imposed on the Okinawan people by the US and Japanese governments has meant for them not just deprivation of sovereignty and territory but deprivation of personal security in the name of national security. As the current phase of Okinawan protest had been triggered by the rape case of 1995, so it was again in May 2016. Sadness and anger stirred the anti-base movement again over the rape and murder of a 20-year old Okinawan woman, to which an American ex-Marine base worker confessed.<sup>87</sup> Indelibly etched on the Okinawan collective memory are not just the 1995 case but many others going back to the rape-murder of 6 year-old Yumiko-chan in 1955 and the crash of a fighter jet onto Miyamori Primary School in 1959 (killing 17 people, including 11 children). A protest and mourning meeting attended by some 400 citizens at short notice on 25 May adopted five demands: drastic overall reduction of US bases, basic revision of the US-Japan SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement), closure and return of Futenma, withdrawal of Osprey, and abandonment of Henoko. Two days later the Prefectural Assembly adopted almost identical demands, but adding that <em>all </em>Marine Corps bases and soldiers (i.e., not just Futenma but also the large, sprawling bases at Camp Schwab, Camp Hansen, and the Northern Training Area) withdraw from the island.<sup>88</sup></p>
<p>Then, a prefectural mass meeting on 19 June, in sombre, mourning mood under a blazing 35 degree sun, heard a message from the father of the victim asking for prefectural unity in demanding withdrawal of <em>all </em>bases. A coalition of 16 Okinawan women’s organizations making up the “Okinawa Women Act against Military Violence” announced the same demand, for the withdrawal of <em>all</em> military bases and armed forces (thereby including also the massive US Air Force base at Kadena and Japan’s own Self-Defense Force units).<sup>89</sup> As posters held by many of the 65,000 who gathered to mourn the victim at the prefectural mass meeting on June 19 declared, the people’s anger “has gone beyond any limit.”</p>
<p>Over the 43 years since Okinawa was resumed within Japan in 1972, by official count US forces and their dependents and civil employees had been responsible for 5,896 criminal incidents, one tenth of them (574) crimes of violence including rape.<sup>90</sup> Countless resolutions of protest had been met with countless promises of good behavior. The Okinawan mood was such that the same promises of future “good behavior” no longer sufficed. A gulf began to open between those calling for withdrawal of all Marines or even all military forces from the island and the “All Okinawa” leadership, including Governor Onaga, who stuck resolutely to the more limited (if nevertheless major) demands: Close Futenma without substitution (no Henoko), and withdraw Osprey.</p>
<p>The crisis today pits the &#8220;irresistible force&#8221; of the nation state against the &#8220;immovable object&#8221; of the Okinawan resistance in a grand, and massively unequal, struggle. At sea, a miniscule flotilla of canoes and kayaks confronts a solid wall of National Coastguard ships and on land a few hundred protesters face off 24 hours a day against riot police outside Camp Schwab Marine Corps base and Takae, trying to block reclamation and construction works on Oura Bay and in the Yambaru forest.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe has staked so much on completing and handing over the new facility to the US Marine Corps that it is almost unimaginable that he could ever abandon it. Governor Onaga is in a similar, if opposite, position. He constitutes the unlikely figure of a conservative politician at the helm of a prefecture in rebellion against a key policy of the national government. Even if he were to submit to a court ruling and withdraw his opposition, far from resolving matters that would infuriate the Okinawan people as a betrayal and heighten their resentment of their own government and of the base system. The supposed linchpin of the regional security system could then become its Achilles heel.</p>
<p>In a democratic polity, when different units of the polity are in dispute, resort to the law would normally be seen as the necessary path to resolution. But as the Henoko problem is referred to the judiciary, there is a question as to whether Abe’s Japan enjoys the division of powers and independence of the judiciary that are the hallmark of a modern, constitutional state. As the Abe government in July 2014 had effectively amended the constitution by the simple device of adopting a new interpretation, so in 2015 it showed scant respect for the relevant laws in the way it addressed Henoko reclamation. As constitutional lawyers had, overwhelmingly, condemned Abe’s 2014 <em>de facto</em> revision of the constitution, so in 2015 they criticized as manipulation or breach of the law the way the Abe government was proceeding in the dispute with Okinawa prefecture.<sup>91</sup></p>
<p>In the event of the decision, or series of decisions, going against Okinawa, Onaga might simply submit, though that seems unlikely and would cause bitter recriminations in the prefecture; or he might refuse and take a stand with the Okinawan people in resistance. In this latter case the government could arrest him, indict him and his “All Okinawa” supporters, and press ahead with construction, gambling on evading serious national or international attention. But sending in the prefectural police, who nominally are under the Governor&#8217;s command, to arrest him would be a high risk path.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, there are many legal options open to Okinawa and to Governor Onaga to delay and obstruct the government. If ordered to do so by the Supreme Court, Onaga has said that he would cancel his cancellation of his predecessor’s reclamation license, but he has said that, even in such event, he will still persist in doing “everything in my power” to stop base construction. That evidently includes issue of a fresh reclamation license cancelation (<em>umetate shonin tekkai</em>) order, and non-cooperation at every ongoing stage of the state’s worksto be seen. The law had never envisaged the carrying out of a massive project of this kind in the teeth of local non-cooperation. Under an ordinance adopted by the Okinawan Prefectural Assembly in 2015, prefectural authorities could, if they so chose, stop and inspect every truckload of soil or sand being imported from outside the prefecture (and at least in principle forbid its entry) because of the fear of pathogens (including Argentine ants) being introduced into the island’s environment.<sup>92</sup> Other ordinances empower the prefecture to protect important “natural monuments” in Oura Bay such as hermit crabs, and of historically important cultural relics era such as “anchor stones” dating back to the pre-modern Ryukyu era.<sup>93</sup></p>
<p>The project the state now attempts to push through has been underway since 1996, repeatedly delayed by the determined, non-violent resistance of the “weak” (Okinawa) against the “strong” (the Japanese state). Since he assumed office for his second term in December 2012 Abe has devoted considerable effort to trying to subject Okinawa to his will, thus far signally without success. The more the delay, the more the frustration and anger in both Washington and Tokyo. The more Abe resorts to deceit, intimidation or violence, the more the resistance stiffens and the Okinawan demands widen and deepen: from Futenma return, Henoko abandonment and Osprey withdrawal to the removal of all marine bases, and perhaps eventually to the removal of all bases. By refusing to listen to Okinawans, Abe pushes the relationship between state and prefecture towards open clash, weakens the US military ties that he is intent on strengthening, irritates the Pentagon he is committed to serving, and exposes Japan to the world as a state that denies basic democratic principle and human rights to the people of one of its prefectures.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a name="footnote_1"></a><sup>1 </sup>Since my book with Satoko Oka Norimatsu (<em>Resistant Islands – Okinawa versus Japan and the United States</em>, Rowman and Littlefield, 2012) covers the years to 2012, this essay may be seen as a supplement. My essays since 2012 have appeared mainly in The Asia-Pacific Journal – Japan Focus, but also in <em>Le Monde Diplomatique</em> (in French and other languages), <em>Sekai</em> (in Japanese) and as chapters in several books in English and Japanese.</span></p>

			<p><em>Government propaganda and NGO misinformation have coloured the story of the war on Syria from its inception. Stepping in to set the record straight, Dr. Tim Anderson explores the real beginnings of the conflict, the players behind it, and their agenda in his new book, “The Dirty War on Syria: Washington, Regime Change and Resistance.”</em></p>
<p>The Dirty War on Syria has relied on a level of mass disinformation not seen in living memory. In seeking ‘regime change’ the big powers sought to hide their hand, using proxy armies of ‘Islamists’, demonising the Syrian Government and constantly accusing it of atrocities. In this way Syrian President Bashar al Assad, a mild-mannered eye doctor, became the new evil in the world.</p>
<p>The popular myths of this dirty war – that it is a ‘civil war’, a ‘popular revolt’ or a sectarian conflict – hide a murderous spree of ‘regime change’ across the region. The attack on Syria was a necessary consequence of Washington’s ambition, stated openly in 2006, to create a ‘New Middle East’. After the destruction of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, Syria was next in line.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5CDJm0Edh8" frameborder="0" width="690" height="400"></iframe></p>
<p>Five years into this war the evidence is quite clear and must be set out in detail. The terrible massacres were mostly committed by the western backed jihadists, then blamed on the Syrian Army. The western media and many western NGOs parroted the official line. Their sources were almost invariably those allied to the ‘jihadists’. Contrary to the myth that the big powers now have their own ‘war on terror’, those same powers have backed every single anti-government armed group in Syria, ‘terrorists’ in any other context, adding thousands of ‘jihadis’ from dozens of countries.</p>
<p>Yet in Syria this dirty war has confronted a disciplined national army which did not disintegrate along sectarian lines. Despite terrible destruction and loss of life, Syria has survived, deepening its alliance with Russia, Iran, the Lebanese Resistance, the secular Palestinians and, more recently, with Iraq. The tide has turned against Washington, and that will have implications beyond Syria.</p>
<p>As western peoples we have been particularly deceived by this dirty war, reverting to our worst traditions of intervention, racial prejudice and poor reflection on our own histories. This book tries to tell its story while rescuing some of the better western traditions: the use of reason, ethical principle and the search for independent evidence.</p>

<p>Fifteen years after the events of 9/11, wars and cultural conflicts caused by the U.S. response and questionable alliances continue to create global tensions. Furthermore, questions of how the attacks took place continue to surface. For these reasons, a historic event highlighting the blatant discrepancies of the official narrative will be held to critique science-based evidence of the most consequential event of our time. A stellar lineup of credentialed experts will also review new evidence of a cover up such as is revealed in the declassification of the 28 pages, and raise the bar – literally, with an unprecedented level of legal analysis.</p>

<p>At the recent annual convention of Veterans for Peace, VFP Vice President Jerry Condon said “The US peace movement has been demobilized by disinformation on Syria.” Disinformation and propaganda on Syria takes three distinct forms. The first is the demonization of the Syrian leadership. The second is the romanticization of the opposition. The third form involves attacking anyone questioning the preceding characterizations.</p>

<p>For years, Apple has perfected the art of tax minimisation, hoovering up possibilities in creating an empire built on profit and return. It has cultivated a power that adapts the message of the bribing agent with that of the bully, tempting government hosts with promises of plenty, and withdrawing pledges on being pushed into moves it would rather not make for the sake of customers and shareholders.  Permit tax breaks, and low tax bills, and your State prospers.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><em>This article was first published by Global Research  on February 25, 2013. </em></p>
<p><em>Excerpted from </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745332323?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0745332323&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=antiwarbookstore">Cruel Harvest: US Intervention in the Afghan Drug Trade</a> <em>(Pluto Press, 2013), by Julien Mercille.</em></p>
<p><em>As Obama proclaims that the US adventure in Afghanistan will draw to a close over the next couple years, we may look at the balance sheet with respect to one of the occupation’s alleged justifications: the fight against Afghan heroin. The outcome has been a total failure. In fact, whereas Afghanistan is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;graveyard of empires&#8221; because throughout history, big powers have attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade and control it, the country can already be labeled as the &#8220;garden of empire&#8221; because the US/NATO occupation has resulted in a drastic increase in drug production.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://original.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hires_130207-A-PV892-003a.jpg" rel="lightbox[5324196]" title="Afghanistan, Garden of Empire: America's Multibillion Dollar Opium Harvest"><img src="http://original.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hires_130207-A-PV892-003a-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Opium production in Afghanistan skyrocketed from 185 tons to 8,200 tons between 2001 and 2007 (today it is down to 3,700 tons). Most commentary glosses over Washington’s large share of responsibility for this dramatic expansion while magnifying the Taliban’s role, which available data indicates is relatively minor. Also, identifying drugs as a main cause behind the growth of the insurgency absolves the United States and NATO of their own role in fomenting it: the very presence of foreign troops in the country as well as their destructive attacks on civilians are significant factors behind increases in popular support for, or tolerance of, the Taliban. In fact, as a recent UNODC report notes, reducing drug production would have only a &#8220;minimal impact on the insurgency’s strategic threat,&#8221; because the Taliban receive &#8220;significant funding from private donors all over the world,&#8221; a contribution that &#8220;dwarfs&#8221; drug money.</p>
<p>A UNODC report entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9211302854?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=9211302854&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=antiwarbookstore">Addiction, Crime and Insurgency: The Transnational Threat of Afghan Opium</a> </em>provides a good example of the conventional view of the Taliban’s role in drug trafficking. It claims that they draw some $125 million annually from narcotics, resulting in the &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of drugs and terrorism heading toward Central Asia and endangering its energy resources. UNODC maintains that when they were in power in the second half of the 1990s, the Taliban earned about $75–100 million per year from drugs, but since 2005 this figure has risen to $125 million. Although this is presented as a significant increase, the Taliban play a lesser role in the opium economy than the report would have us believe as they capture only a small share of its total value. Moreover, drug money is likely a secondary source of funding for them: UNODC itself estimates that only 10 percent to 15 percent of Taliban funding is drawn from drugs and 85 percent comes from &#8220;non-opium sources&#8221; such as private donations.</p>
<table width="5" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right">

</table>
<p>The total revenue generated by opiates within Afghanistan is about $3 billion per year. According to UNODC data, the Taliban get only about 5 percent of this sum. Farmers selling their opium harvest to traffickers get 20 percent. And the remaining 75 percent? Al-Qaeda? No: the report specifies that it &#8220;does not appear to have a direct role in the Afghan opiates trade,&#8221; although it may participate in &#8220;low-level drugs and/or arms smuggling&#8221; along the Pakistani border. Instead, the remaining 75 percent is captured by traffickers, government officials, the police, and local and regional power brokers – in short, many of the groups now supported or tolerated by the United States and NATO are important actors in the drug trade.</p>
<p>Therefore, claims that &#8220;Taliban insurgents are earning astonishingly large profits off the opium trade&#8221; are misleading. Nevertheless, UNODC insists on the Taliban-drugs connection but pays less attention to individuals and groups supported or tolerated by Washington. The agency seems to be acting as an enabler of coalition policies in Afghanistan: when asked what percentage of total drug income in Afghanistan is captured by government officials, the UNODC official who supervised the above report quickly replied: &#8220;We don’t do that, I don’t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mainstream commentary blames the size of the narcotics industry and much of what goes wrong in Afghanistan partly on corruption. But to focus on bad apples in the Afghan government and police misses the systemic responsibility of the United States and NATO for the dramatic expansion of opiates production since 2001 and for their support of numerous corrupt individuals in power. The United States attacked Afghanistan in association with Northern Alliance warlords and drug lords and showered them with weapons, millions of dollars, and diplomatic support.</p>
<p>The empowerment and enrichment of those individuals enabled them to tax and protect opium traffickers, leading to the quick resumption of narcotics production after the hiatus of the 2000–2001 Taliban ban, as many observers have documented. Ahmed Rashid has written that the whole Afghan Interior Ministry &#8220;became a major protector of drug traffickers, and Karzai refused to clean it out. As warlord militias were demobilized and disarmed by the UN, commanders found new positions in the Interior Ministry and continued to provide protection to drug traffickers.&#8221; The United States was not interested in cleaning Afghanistan of drug traffickers either. Thus, to blame &#8220;corruption&#8221; and &#8220;criminals&#8221; for the current state of affairs is to ignore the direct and predictable effects of US policies, which have followed a historical pattern of toleration and protection of strongmen involved in narcotics.</p>
<p>In 2004, Afghan forces found an enormous cache of heroin in a truck near Kandahar, but both Wali Karzai, the president’s brother, and an aide to President Karzai called the commander of the group that had made the discovery to tell him to release the drugs and the truck. Two years later, American and Afghan counternarcotics forces seized more than 110 pounds of heroin near Kabul, which US investigators said were linked to Wali Karzai. But Wali Karzai was only the tip of the iceberg, as a former CIA officer asserted that virtually &#8220;every significant Afghan figure has had brushes with the drug trade.&#8221; In private, American officials acknowledge ties with drug-linked Afghan figures. A Wikileaks cable recounting US officials’ meetings with Wali Karzai in September 2009 and February 2010 stated that while &#8220;we must deal with AWK [Ahmed Wali Karzai] as the head of the Provincial Council, he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker.&#8221; But in public, the ties are denied. As Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: &#8220;We should not condemn Ahmed Wali Karzai or damage our critical relations with his brother, President Karzai, on the basis of newspaper articles or rumors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the annual $65 billion global market for opiates, only 5 to 10 percent ($3 to $5 billion) is estimated to be laundered by informal banking systems, while two-thirds ($40 to $45 billion) is available for laundering through the formal banking system. A recent UNODC report estimated that about $220 billion of drug money is laundered annually through the financial system. However, only about 0.2 percent of all laundered criminal money is seized and frozen, as governments have other priorities than regulating the banking industry, which benefits from this extra liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>US COUNTERNARCOTICS POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Until about 2005, American policy in Afghanistan was, by and large, not concerned with drugs. General Tommy Franks, who led the initial attack, declared in 2002 that US troops would stay clear of drug interdiction and that resolving narcotics problems was up to Afghans and civilians. When Donald Rumsfeld was asked in 2003 what the United States was doing about narcotics in Helmand, he replied: &#8220;You ask what we’re going to do and the answer is, I don’t really know.&#8221; A US military spokesman at Bagram base, Sergeant Major Harrison Sarles, stated: &#8220;We’re not a drug task force. That’s not part of our mission.&#8221; Moreover, the DEA had only two agents in Afghanistan in 2003 and didn’t open an office in the country until 2004.</p>
<p>Several reasons explain the early opposition to counternarcotics on the part of the White House and the military. First, Afghanistan was attacked to show that Washington should not be challenged, and destroying poppy crops and heroin labs contributes nothing in this respect. Therefore, there is no reason why any effort should have been directed toward that task. In late 2005, Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, then commander of US forces in Afghanistan, made it clear that &#8220;drugs are bad, but his orders were that drugs were not a priority of the U.S. military in Afghanistan.&#8221; Furthermore, Washington’s most important target at that time was Iraq, whose oil resources and strategic location in the Persian Gulf region ensured that it would take priority.</p>
<p>Second, many of the United States’ local Afghan allies were involved in trafficking, from which they drew money and power. Destroying drug labs and poppy fields would have been, in effect, a direct blow to American operations and proxy fighters on the ground. As Western diplomats conceded at the time, &#8220;without money from drugs, our friendly warlords can’t pay their militias. It’s as simple as that.&#8221; According to James Risen, this explains why the Pentagon and the White House refused to bomb the 25 or so drug facilities that the CIA had identified on its maps in 2001. Similarly, in 2005, the Pentagon denied all but 3 of 26 DEA requests for airlifts. Barnett Rubin summarized the US attitude well when he wrote in 2004 that when &#8220;he visits Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld meets military commanders whom Afghans know as the godfathers of drug trafficking. The message has been clear: Help fight the Taliban and no one will interfere with your trafficking.&#8221; As a result, US military officials closed their eyes to the trade. An Army Green Beret said he was &#8220;specifically ordered to ignore heroin and opium when he and his unit discovered them on patrol.&#8221; A US Senate report mentioned that &#8220;congressional committees received reports that U.S. forces were refusing to disrupt drug sales and shipments and rebuffing requests from the Drug Enforcement Administration for reinforcements to go after major drug kingpins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Third, the Department of Defense thought that eradicating crops would upset farmers and hurt attempts at winning Afghan hearts and minds. Indeed, since 2001, the Taliban have sought to capitalize on resentment caused by eradication schemes. For example, in Helmand &#8220;they appear to have offered protection to the farmers targeted by eradication&#8221; and in Kandahar &#8220;they were even reported to have offered financial assistance to farmers whose fields were being eradicated, in exchange for support in fighting against the government.&#8221; Thus, it is far from certain that eliminating drugs would weaken the insurgency. In fact, the opposite is more likely, as it would only add to the opposition already generated by NATO operations in the country, as noted by a well-informed analyst: &#8220;As the conflict progressed, victims of abuses by both Afghan and foreign troops and of the side-effects of US reliance on air power began to represent another important source of recruits for the Taliban.&#8221;</p>
<p>From 2004, counternarcotics started slowly moving up the US agenda. In 2005, Washington developed its first counternarcotics strategy for Afghanistan, composed of five pillars: elimination/eradication, interdiction, justice reform, public information, and alternative livelihoods (although the pillars were not weighted equally: alternative development was relatively neglected, while eradication/elimination was the priority). The Afghan government incorporated this strategy into its own 2006 National Drug Control Strategy, which was later updated and integrated into its National Development Strategy in 2008. Around 2005, counternarcotics operations were still relatively isolated from the broader counterinsurgency strategy. Nevertheless, the Pentagon started to consider the possibility of getting involved in counterdrug missions and issued new guidelines authorizing the military to &#8220;move antidrug agents by helicopters and cargo planes and assist in planning missions and uncovering targets,&#8221; among other things. A number of counternarcotics units were set up, such as Task Force 333 (a covert squad of special agents) and the Central Poppy Eradication Force, an Afghan team trained by the American private contractor Dyncorp at a cost of $50 million and supervised by the United States through the Afghan Ministry of the Interior, where Washington’s main contact was Lieutenant General Mohammad Daoud. It didn’t seem to be a problem that Daoud was &#8220;an ex-warlord from the north who was reputed to have major connections with the drug trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 2007, the United States has intensified its counternarcotics efforts and sought to integrate them more closely with the counterinsurgency campaign. In particular, in late 2008, the Pentagon changed its rules of engagement to permit US troops to target traffickers allied with insurgents and terrorists, and soldiers were allowed to accompany and protect counternarcotics operations run by Americans and Afghans. This shift was also adopted by NATO, whose members were allowed to participate in interdiction missions.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the Obama administration’s strategy has deemphasized eradication by ending support for the Afghan central eradication force while focusing on interdiction and the destruction of heroin labs, based on the reasoning that this &#8220;would more precisely target the drug-insurgency nexus.&#8221; A focus on rural development has also been announced because, as Richard Holbrooke declared, eradication is a &#8220;waste of money,&#8221; it alienates farmers, and it &#8220;might destroy some acreage, but it didn’t reduce the amount of money the Taliban got by one dollar. It just helped the Taliban.&#8221; The number of permanent DEA agents in Afghanistan has increased from 13 to over 80 in 2011 and the Pentagon has established a Combined Joint Interagency Task Force-Nexus in Kandahar to provide coordination support and intelligence for DEA interdiction missions and ISAF counterinsurgency operations that target insurgents with links to the drug trade.</p>
<p>Overall, an interesting question is to explain the emergence, intensification and militarization of US counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan. Although such a discussion remains somewhat speculative, what follows discusses possible reasons that may account for the evolution of the anti-drug strategy over time. Some have pointed to the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld as secretary of defense in 2006. Rumsfeld had always been strongly opposed to military involvement in drug control and thus his departure is thought to have contributed to a &#8220;sea change&#8221; in the Department of Defense’s attitude, which then became more engaged in counternarcotics. However, the significance of staff changes should be downplayed when explaining the broad outlines of policy. It is not as if Rumsfeld had prevented single-handedly an army of drug warriors in the US government from carrying out counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan. As seen above, there were clear strategic reasons for the lack of military involvement in counternarcotics in the years immediately after 2001.</p>
<p>Congressional pressures have also been identified as a reason. This political pressure, the argument goes, eventually led the Pentagon and CIA to accept publicly that the insurgency was funded by drugs and to approve the 2005 counternarcotics strategy. Indeed, in 2004–05, a host of critical pieces in the media urged more action in light of the large 2004 opium harvest. For example, Henry Hyde, Illinois Republican, stated that there was &#8220;a clear need at this stage for military action against the opium storage dumps and heroin laboratories&#8221; and that if the military did not get involved, the United States would need to send &#8220;troops from places like Turkey to take on this challenge.&#8221; The Democrats also pitched in, as when John Kerry criticized Bush for failing to eliminate narcotics in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Such explanations might be correct in terms of immediate causes, in that congressional pressures and debates contributed to putting the issue on policymakers’ agenda and generating media coverage. However, they beg the question of why the narcotics issue became a more prominent debate within government circles in the first place? Some have pointed to the explosion of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan and the political pressures it has generated in the United States to do something about the problem. For example, Ahmed Rashid noted how the greater emphasis on drugs in US policy from 2005 onwards was prompted in part by the fact that it had become too obvious that Afghan poppy cultivation was getting out of control. The United States could less easily afford to be seen as doing nothing, for public relations purposes. The 2004 massive opium harvest embarrassed Washington and London enough for them to begin addressing narcotics more seriously: farmland under poppy cultivation had just increased by 64 percent and for the first time poppies were cultivated in all 34 of Afghanistan’s provinces. Similarly, opium production rose to 6,100 tons in 2006 and to 8,200 tons in 2007, the highest amount ever recorded, and Afghanistan now accounted for 93 percent of global heroin production. The skyrocketing of drug production in 2006 and 2007, publicized in UNODC reports, could not be ignored indefinitely.</p>
<p>There is probably some truth to this interpretation. Even if drug control is not a US objective, the discourse that has been created around the issue has acquired a force of its own. Therefore, when poppy cultivation spread in Afghanistan to a point that it became difficult to ignore, Washington was forced to make some gesture seemingly addressing the problem, otherwise, its image as a government allegedly concerned with drug harms could have been tarnished.</p>
<p>Finally, another possible reason is that from 2004–05, it became useful politically to talk about a war on drugs to make the resurgent Taliban look evil by associating them with narcotics. Indeed, the intensification of counternarcotics rhetoric and operations &#8220;took place against the backdrop of an upsurge in armed opposition&#8221; to the US-backed Afghan government. That is to say, whereas in the years immediately after 2001, the drug trade was largely controlled by US allies (warlords), from the time the Taliban reemerged as a significant force partly financed by drugs, narcotics became an issue that could be used to cast a negative light on them. Indeed, it is interesting that since 2004, the intensification of drug war rhetoric has grown in parallel with the rise of the insurgency.</p>
<p>In sum, while from 2001 to 2005, drugs were simply not part of the US agenda in Afghanistan, since 2005, there has been more talk about drug control, and more counter-narcotics operations have taken place. However, this does not mean that the United States is moving closer to conducting a real war on drugs. It is not the intensification of militaristic counterdrug missions per se that makes a drug war real, but the implementation of strategies known to reduce drug problems. On that count, Washington has failed. Further, the United States has continued to support allies involved in trafficking, and Obama stated explicitly that his drug war is instrumental in fighting the insurgency and not about eliminating drugs per se. Indeed, in 2009, his administration presented its new approach to narcotics and elaborated a target list of 50 &#8220;major drug traffickers <em>who help finance the insurgency</em>&#8221; to be killed or captured by the military. Therefore, if traffickers help the Taliban, they will be attacked – but if they support government forces, they apparently will be left alone. This suggests that the drug war is used to target enemies.</p>

			<p><em>The headlines in the media in the lead-up to the G20 leader’s summit meeting in Hangzhou China, which concluded on Monday, were that it would have to find a way to boost global growth and deal with the rise of protectionism. The communiqué which emerged at its conclusion revealed that neither of those objectives came even close to being met.</em></p>
<p>Like statements from previous meetings, it contained a series of warnings about “downside risks” emanating from potential volatility in financial markets, continuing sluggish trade and investment and low productivity and employment growth and then offered a commitment to “usher in a new era of global growth.”</p>
<p>With the evident failure of monetary policies based on the pumping of trillions of dollars into the global financial system to stimulate expansion of the real economy, the communiqué noted that “fiscal strategies”—increased government spending—are “equally important to supporting our common growth strategies.”</p>
<p>But it was an empty phrase because it went on to state that such “policy options” would be “tailored to country circumstances.” In other words, there is no binding global commitment to boost the economy and each national government, while calling on others to take action, will continue with its own austerity agenda.</p>
<p>It is significant that under conditions where it is recognised that the central economic problem is lack of investment and demand, the only measure which contained real teeth was aimed at cutting back production in the global steel industry—a measure directed against China.</p>
<p>While not directly naming China, the G20 decided to establish a Global Forum on excess steel capacity to report back in 2017. The measure was pushed through with the threat from the European Union that if China did not agree it could face an adverse decision on its push to be accorded “market economy status” under the World Trade Organisation, which comes up later this year.</p>
<p>Such were the tensions surrounding the issue that, according to one official cited by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>: “If you are looking for blood, steel overcapacity was the issue.”</p>
<p>While the G20 communiqué repeated many of the standard phrases of past meetings, including the need for “structural reforms,” the code for deepening attacks on the employment and social conditions of the working class, there was a new political dimension to this year’s meeting.</p>
<p>Overshadowing the summit were concerns there is a deepening hostility among broad sections of the world’s population to the policies of the past eight years that have resulted in ever-worsening living standards and the growth of social inequality to historically unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>This was the first meeting of world leaders since the referendum vote in the UK to quit the European Union, a distorted reflection of growing opposition to the drive to austerity and cuts in living standards. The growing hatred of the political establishment has been reflected in the US, both in the rise of the far-right Republican Trump presidential candidacy, the widespread support for the self-styled “democratic socialist” Bernie Sanders in the race for the Democratic Party nomination and the broad hatred for the party’s nominee Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>The communiqué pointed to the growing concerns in ruling circles over this social opposition with a series of empty phrases about meeting the needs of “present and future generations,” ensuring public support for expanded growth in a globalised economy and the need for an “integrated narrative for strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth.”</p>
<p>Fears of what it could bring were voiced in closed-door sessions. According to a report in the <em>Financial Times</em>, “US president Barack Obama, British prime minister Theresa May and her Australian and Canadian counterparts emphasised the need to placate public discontent.” The Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, reportedly told the meeting there was a need to “civilise capitalism.”</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the summit, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde also addressed these issues warning that economic growth had been “too low for too long for too few.”</p>
<p>“There was also a determination around the room to better identify the benefits of trade in order to respond to the populist backlash against globalisation,” she said.</p>
<p>The so-called backlash against globalisation is the expression of a deeper phenomenon—growing hostility to the operation of the capitalist profit system itself. The leaders of the countries named in the <em>Financial Times</em> report have reasons for concern, along with their counterparts in other countries, as statistics on the rise of social inequality make clear.</p>
<p>In the UK, real wages between 2007 and 2015 fell by 10.4 percent, a figure only matched in Greece, where workers were savaged by the austerity drive of the IMF and the EU.</p>
<p>In the US economic inequality leap ahead in 2015 with the average incomes of the top 1 percent rising twice as fast as the rest of the population. The top 10 percent of the population collected more than half of total US household income.</p>
<p>Last year the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which covers 35 of the wealthiest countries, reported that income inequality had reached an all-time high, a situation which is certain to have worsened since then.</p>
<p>The Australian prime minister Turnbull attended the summit after being returned to office on July 2 by a bare one-seat majority in an election marked by deepening hostility to the entire political establishment and in which the government’s slogan of “jobs and growth” stood in marked contrast to an economic and social reality characterised by four years of stagnant real wages and the replacement of full-time jobs with part-time and casual employment.</p>
<p>Turnbull’s call to “civilise capitalism,” along with all the other references to “inclusive growth,” is a completely empty phrase because the depredations afflicting billions of people do not arise from a series of misguided policies but are rooted in the irresolvable contradiction of the capitalist economy, based on the drive for profit.</p>
<p>The underlying fear of the ruling class, which saw partial expression at the G20 summit, is that the present inchoate opposition to the capitalist order will take the form, not of a “backlash against globalisation” but the development of a socialist movement based on the understanding that civilisation can only be advanced by the overthrow of the socially-destructive and historically-outmoded profit system.</p>

			<p><em>The whipping up of a scandal last week against Labor Senator Sam Dastyari for accepting $1,670 from a Chinese company is escalating into a general witchhunt against any politician, business figure or organisation that questions a militarist policy toward Beijing. Dastyari has been branded a “Manchurian candidate.” Across the media, allegations are being made that Australia is under threat from a fifth column who have either been bought off by Chinese “soft power” or who, because of their Chinese background, have allegiance to a “foreign power.”</em></p>
<p>The campaign was launched by the state-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which on August 29 accused China of being responsible for the hacking of a defence research institution and the trade and investment corporation, Austrade. The offensive was joined by the leading business journal, the <em>Australian Financial Review</em>. After exposing Dastyari’s acceptance of Chinese payments, it published 11 separate articles on September 2 that in varying ways attacked China as a danger to Australian interests.</p>
<p>The most remarkable article alleged that the Australian intelligence agencies, which work in daily collaboration with their US partners, do not trust Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull due to his past business relations in, and statements on, China.</p>
<p>The Murdoch-owned <em>Australian</em> followed with an editorial yesterday on the need to root out the “Chinese soft power push in Australia.” It editorialised today that Labor Party leader Bill Shorten must demand answers from Dastyari on the relationship between Chinese payments and questions Dastyari asked in the Senate last year, which concerned whether Australia would join a war in the South China Sea. The obvious implication by the <em>Australian</em> is that Dastyari was attempting to gain information for the Chinese state.</p>
<p>A column in today’s <em>Australian</em> by Paul Dibb, a leading strategic analyst and author of the 1986 Defence White Paper, sinisterly notes that there are now one million Australian residents of Chinese background, one third of whom were born in China, along with some 140,000 Chinese students in Australia.</p>
<p>Dibb asserts:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact is, there are a considerable number of Chinese residents and students here who feel nostalgic about the People’s Republic and its ruling party. If that is so, we have a dangerous case on our hands with a group of people who are not integrating and who owe allegiance to a foreign power.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The most vicious contribution to the anti-China campaign was published today by the international editor of the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>, Peter Hartcher.</p>
<p>Hartcher declared that Australian “sovereignty” is at risk because of pro-Beijing layers in politics, business and within the Chinese Australian community. Australia, he asserts, “has been pretty naïve in the way it sees China.”</p>
<p>Hartcher’s column, and the language with which it was written, warrants extensive review. It provides an ominous warning of what is set to engulf Australian politics.</p>
<p>Hartcher writes: “Chairman Mao famously launched a hygiene campaign in 1958 called the ‘Four Pests Campaign.’ Citizens were urged to eradicate rats, flies, mosquitoes and sparrows. Australia needs to wage a campaign of vigilance against foreign manipulation of its democracy. In terms that Mao would have understood, perhaps a ‘Four Pests Campaign’ of our own is required to defend against agents of foreign influence.”</p>
<p>Hartcher labels as the “rats” in Australia, “politicians compromised by China’s embrace.” Dastyari, he asserts, is just one. “There will be many more.”</p>
<p>The “flies” are “unwitting paid-mouthpieces for the interests of the Chinese regime.” Hartcher names Bob Carr, former New South Wales premier and Labor government foreign minister, as one such fly, because Carr established the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology in Sydney with a $1.8 million donation from a Chinese corporation.</p>
<p>The “mosquitoes” are Australian business people “so captivated by their financial interests that they demand Australia assume a kowtow position.” Hartcher names media and mining billionaire Kerry Stokes—chairman of television station Channel 7—as a mosquito because in 2011 he opposed the basing of US marines in the northern city of Darwin. Casino billionaire James Packer is also named as a mosquito.</p>
<p>Most ominously, Chinese Australian organisations and Chinese student associations on the universities are identified by Hartcher as the “sparrows” that allegedly exist “specifically to spread Beijing’s influence.” He names the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China as the “central” sparrow.</p>
<p>Hartcher concludes: “Pests. Who needs them?”</p>
<p>This is the language of political purges, police raids, mass arrests and internment camps for “traitors” and “enemy aliens” in the event of a war with China. Such actions accompanied Australia’s involvement in World War I, with the round-up of thousands of German Australians and the suppression of the most militant anti-war organisations, such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). World War II saw the internment of as many as 12,000 people of German, Italian and Japanese background and the illegalisation of the Australian section of the Fourth International. Trotskyists were imprisoned for opposing the war.</p>
<p>The context of the media campaign is the steady escalation of tensions between the United States and China, particularly over US challenges to Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. The Obama administration and the Pentagon have left no doubt that they expect Australian warships and aircraft to conduct “freedom of navigation” incursions within territorial limits around Chinese-held islets in order to demonstrate the US is not acting alone. Through Chinese state-owned media, the Beijing regime has warned that any Australian warship that does so could be attacked by the Chinese military.</p>
<p>The prevailing sentiment within the overwhelming majority of the Australian working class is anti-war. The dominant factions of the ruling class, however, intend to follow Washington in defiance of the population. The foul sewer of anti-Chinese chauvinism and hysteria pouring out from the media is a desperate attempt to justify ruthless attacks on democratic rights and involvement in a US-led confrontation with nuclear-armed China.</p>

			<p><em>Recent outbreaks of a sickness known as the Zika virus have sparked hysteria across the globe, and many reports have actually indicated that this is likely a man-made disaster, as the origin of Zika itself is somewhat strange.</em></p>
<p>The virus was “discovered” in 1947, however, it was not discovered in the wild nor did it spontaneously arise. In fact, it was discovered by Rockefeller Foundation scientists in a monkey that they had in captivity, leading many to believe that this was the result of some type of experiment. Since then, cases of Zika have been extremely rare, but in the past few years, outbreaks of Zika have been on the rise, especially in South America and specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>Oddly, the recent outbreak in Brazil coincides with the release of genetically modified mosquitoes in 2012, by the British biotech company Oxitec. Not only did the new outbreak occur just after the release, but it also occurred in the same area.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-7.36.47-AM.png" rel="lightbox[5544257]" title="Screen Shot 2016-09-06 at 7.36.47 AM"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5544258" title="Screen Shot 2016-09-06 at 7.36.47 AM" src="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-7.36.47-AM.png" alt="" width="449" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>Ironically enough, the GM mosquitos were actually proposed as a solution to infectious disease, but many experts warned that there was not enough research and that a release of such an organism into the wild could have disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>As news of Zika spread this week, rumors also reached the internet that the virus was available for purchase online. Sure enough, there is actually a sale <a href="http://www.atcc.org/Products/All/VR-84.aspx?slp=1&amp;geo_country=us#history" target="_blank">listing for Zika online through a website called atcc.org,</a> where a number of different viruses and biological agents are sold to research teams. For the sake of investigation, the Free Thought Project tried to go through the application process that was required to buy the virus, just to see if anyone with $516 to spend would be able to get their hands on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-23.37.30.png" rel="lightbox[5544257]" title="Screen Shot 2016-09-06 at 23.37.30"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5544300" title="Screen Shot 2016-09-06 at 23.37.30" src="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-23.37.30-1024x996.png" alt="" width="717" height="697" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case there are people out there who think this may be a ‘conspiracy theory,’ you can plainly see that the source for the Zika virus is, in fact, from <em>J. Casals, Rockefeller Foundation</em>, and sourced from <em>Blood from experimental forest sentinel rhesus monkey, Uganda, 1947.</em></p>
<p>After initially trying to buy the virus, we were prompted to create a user account on the website. After that, we were led through a dozen pages of forms, where we were asked information about our organization, tax ID # and the biosafety level of our lab. While this seems to be tight security, we were able to input false information and fudge the requirements to complete the application process. We are still waiting for our application to be approved, but we did not have to upload any type of proof that we are a legitimate facility.</p>
<p>It seems that while the virus is available online, it is not extremely easy to get, and would likely require some extremely creative fraud in order to make it happen. However, it definitely does seem that it would be possible for a group or individual that is determined enough to make their way through the website’s security measures.</p>

			<p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em></p>
<p><em>China has made strategic choices favouring renewables over fossil fuels that are still not widely understood or appreciated. Hao Tan and I have been making these arguments for several years now, and in particular in <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/economics-manufacture-renewables-to-build-energy-security-1.15847">our article in Nature in September 2014</a> we argued that China had overwhelming economic and energy security reasons for opting in favour of renewables, in addition to the obvious environmental benefits.<sup>1</sup> In this article I wish to take these arguments further and update the picture to incorporate comprehensive 2015 data as well as fresh targets for 2017 and 2020. The context is China’s continuing battle to scale back its use of coal; its imminent release of the country’s 13<sup>th</sup> FYP for Energy, based on the overall 13<sup>th</sup> FYP for economic development over the five years 2016 to 2020, where new renewable energy targets will be announced or consolidated [<a href="https://www.chinadialogue.net/blog/9113-All-eyes-on-China-s-13th-Five-Year-Plan-for-energy/en">See ChinaDialogue</a>]; and China’s hosting of the G20 meeting in Hangzhou in September, where it will be promoting an international drive for greening of finance – with China itself playing a key role in this process. China is becoming a major promoter of international infrastructure development, in Africa and across Central Asia through the One Belt-One Road strategy – and this too carries strong implications for other countries’ energy choices.</em></p>
<p><strong>The 2015 results</strong></p>
<p>The first task is to review the results for China’s electric power system in 2015, to check that the leading edge of the system is still greening faster than it is becoming black – as Hao Tan and I have demonstrated for previous years. And it’s clear that the 2015 data do indeed support this trend. While the electric power system is just one industry, it is a large one and traditionally a heavy user of coal. And the strategic direction it takes carries over to the rest of the economy. So using the electric power system as proxy for the economy as a whole (it is the largest consumer of coal), the full data are given in Table 1, covering the three aspects of electric power generated, electric generating capacity added, and investment in new generating facilities.</p>

<p>First, in terms of electric power generated, we find that total electric power generated by China in the year 2015 was 5,600 TWh (or billion kWh) – making China’s electric power generation by far the highest in the world. This total is flattening out, indicating that China is decoupling its energy consumption from economic growth. Each year the proportion of electricity generated by thermal sources (fossil fuels) declines; it reached just 73% in 2015 (meaning that non-thermal sources, mostly renewables, account for 27% of the electricity generated). In fact, the power generated from thermal sources actually declined in absolute terms in 2015, down to 4,077 TWh – a decline of 96 TWh, or by 2.3% compared with the year before – and this for the second year in a row. By contrast, power generated from pure renewables (water, wind and sun) increased in 2015 by 116 TWh, to reach 1,362 TWh – up 9.30% on the year before. So power generated from thermal sources declined in absolute terms in 2015, while power generated from water, wind and sun increased. This is the clearest possible evidence that the leading edge of the electric power generating system is greening. Nuclear sources also accounted for an extra 35 TWh, to reach 161 TWh – still a long way behind WWS (Water, Wind and Sun) pure renewable sources.</p>
<p>Of course the system as a whole is still largely black – that’s what 73% dependence on fossil fuels means. But the trend, the leading edge, is definitely headed in a green direction. Over the past decade, dependence on thermal sources reached a peak of 83.3% of power generated in the two years 2006 and 2007, and has been declining each year since to reach just 73.0% in 2015 – or a 10% decline in a decade. This is a remarkably swift shift for such a large technical system – particularly one that is growing rapidly – and is the basis for targets that see thermal sources accounting for just 63% by 2020 and less than 50% by 2030. By this time the total electric power system in China would be greener than blacker. The implications of these trends and data for coal consumption and carbon emissions will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of generating capacity the same shift in a green direction can be detected, if less strongly. Total electric power generating capacity reached just over 1.5 TW by 2015 – again, by far the largest in the world (compared with the US total of just 1 TW). In terms of capacity added in 2015 (i.e. where the system is changing), thermal sources added 74.5 GW, while water, wind and sun sources added 66.3 GW and nuclear a further 6.2 GW, making non-thermal sources adding 72.5 GW – so that thermal sources added marginally more than non-thermal sources in the year. It is the sub-totals that are of most interest, with China adding world records of 32.5 GW wind power in 2015 (to reach a cumulative total of 130 GW) and 14.6 GW of solar power, to reach a cumulative total of 41.1 GW – both totals being by far the largest of any country in the world, and growing faster than in any other country.</p>
<p>In terms of capacity added, 66% came from thermal sources in 2015 and 32.5% from water, wind and sun, plus 1.7% from nuclear, or 34% from non-thermal sources – more than a third. This demonstrates clearly how large the Chinese commitment to non-thermal sources of electric power has become. Now as in the case for 2014 data we have an immediate issue to explain in these statistics, which is how a system that adds thermal power capacity in 2015 (albeit at a low rate) can actually generate less power from these sources than in the previous year. The answer is consistent with the explanation given by Tan and myself in 2014, namely that much of the thermal power capacity being added is actually not being utilized in generating electricity.</p>
<p>When we look at trends in capacity being installed, we see another strong trend in China towards the green outranking the black. As noted for the 2015 results discussed above, there is a significant change in China’s energy patterns headlined by a strong shift towards the use of renewables, namely electric power generation from renewable sources such as wind, solar PV and water (hydro). This is captured in the changing proportions of power generated from WWS sources vs power generated from thermal sources in terms of capacity – as shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>Chart 1 demonstrates a clear change in direction in China’s electric power system – with WWS generating capacity rising from a low of just 21% in the years 2006 to 2007 to reach 32.5% in 2015 – or more than a 10% increase in a decade. This is a rapid shift in the fundamentals of the electric power system – with China demonstrating to other industrial and industrializing countries that the green shift is feasible and that it can deliver economic, social and environmental benefits.</p>
<p>So the trends in terms of capacity are very clear. The total capacity for water, wind and sun in 2015 reached, as we have seen, no less than 490 GW power – very nearly half a trillion watts of clean power. According to official targets, the total is set to rise to 550 GW in 2017 (330 GW for water, 150 GW for wind and 70 GW for solar). And by 2020 the targets specify 740 GW (made up of 340 GW for water, 250 GW for wind, and 150 GW for solar PV). Note that these are realistic targets, consistent with previous rates of growth and with the additions for 2015. If China is indeed generating renewable power at 740 GW in 2020 it would be the world’s undisputed renewables superpower – and one that is well on the way to becoming the world’s first country to become a terawatt renewables powerhouse (generating in excess of 1 TW or 1000 GW) by early in the 2020s – less than a decade from now.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the trends in terms of investment show a similar greening tendency outstripping the tendency towards blackening, or adding further coal-fired sources to the energy system. China’s investment in renewables sources of electric power in 2015 reached a world record of $110.5 billion – mostly going on wind farms, solar farms and hydro dams (including smaller hydro facilities, not just giant dams). According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), China’s investment of $110 billion accounts for no less than 33% of the global green investment of $329 billion in 2015 – itself a world record total. China’s investment matches the combined total of the next two industrial powers, namely the US ($56 billion) and the EU ($58.5 billion).</p>
<p>The contrast with investment in thermal generating capacity is striking. According to China’s National Energy Administration, China invested 139.6 billion yuan (around US$21 billion) in new coal-fired power stations in 2015. This is less than a fifth of the investment in clean energy sources. In the same briefing on the electricity sector in China in 2015 the NEA revealed that investment in hydro amounted to 78.2 billion yuan (or US$11.7 billion) and in nuclear power investment was 56 billion yuan (or US$8.4 billion). So it is safe to say that China’s green investment in renewable power sources in 2015 well surpassed investment in thermal sources. This is a third indication that the leading edge of the electric power system is greener than blacker. The most arresting feature of China’s greening of investment in energy in 2015 was the introduction of green bonds as a major source of finance – a point to be returned to in a moment.</p>
<p><strong>Overall trends</strong></p>
<p><strong>Continuing coal dependence</strong></p>
<p>The first point to acknowledge is how enormous China’s coal-based power system is, and how it continues to spew out carbon emissions as well as other greenhouse gases such as methane. There is as well the particulate pollution that so ruins the air in China’s big cities. China burns far more coal than any other country – indeed, as much as the rest of the world combined. This is the price that China has paid, and is paying, for its breakneck industrialization through which it is catching up with the industrially advanced world.</p>
<p>While China is reducing its consumption of and reliance on coal each year, it nevertheless burns a lot of coal and will continue to do so for many years to come. When Hao Tan and I last examined this issue we noted the rapid increase in approvals for new coal-fired power plants being issued by provincial governments – but more recent moves by the national agencies including the NEA seem to have reversed these trends, and China is now on a path to permanently reducing its coal production and consumption, and coal imports, in favour of progressively greater reliance on green energy sources. Some commentators now project that China’s carbon emissions could peak by 2020 – a full decade earlier than commitments made by China in UN climate gatherings and as part of the US-China Climate Agreement reached in 2014.</p>
<p>China’s ‘black’ energy system is certainly still black – although it is greening at the edges, as shown clearly in Fig. 2. Here it can be seen how China’s thermal generation of electricity increased rapidly (the black bars) particularly after 2001 when China joined the WTO and was ‘open for business’. But the last two years have seen a decline in thermal power generation from the peak reached in 2014. Coal consumption overall and coal consumed in power generation are shown as continuous lines, where again there was a marked increase after 2001 for the first decade and a half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, followed by a plateau and then absolute decline in 2014 and 2015.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Source of primary data: The data for conventional thermal electricity generation is available from the China Electricity Council (CEC); the data for total coal production is available from the BP Statistical Review (2016) ‘Statistics of World Energy’; the data for coal consumption for thermal power generation is available from the National Bureau of Statistics, China.</strong></p>

<p>This is the ‘black face’ of China that is responsible for so much particulate pollution, making the air in cities like Tianjin and Beijing unbreathable. Indeed China’s coal consumption fell in 2015 to reach just over 4 billion tonnes. Coal production actually peaked in 2013, and has been falling ever since. Even more dramatically China’s coal imports fell in 2015 by 30%. Coal imports fell to 204 Mt in 2015, down from 291 Mt in 2014 – a drop of 30% in a year. And this trend can be expected to continue. The National Energy Administration (NEA) announced in 2015 that it would not approve any more coal-fired power stations, effectively putting them under a moratorium for the next three years.</p>
<p>The levelling off in coal consumption around 2012/2013, with coal consumption actually falling in the years 2014 and again in 2015, is striking. It reveals the power exercised by governments in China, both national and provincial, to intervene in the economy to drive things in a new direction. This is an important advantage enjoyed by China.<sup>2</sup> On the other hand, there have been reports of provincial governments deliberately intervening to support their coal-fired power plants at the expense of wind power installations. The Chinese Wind Energy Association has pointed to the Yunnan provincial government issuing a policy that imposed a surcharge on wind and hydropower producers and used the revenue to subsidize coal-fired plants; a similar arrangement was reported from the Xinjiang provincial government.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>At the same time we see that China has been building its green energy system as complement to the black, coal-fired system during a transition period. Taking wind power as the prime case, Fig. 3 demonstrates how China’s wind power capacity has been rapidly built out, doubling every three years or so since 2007.</p>

<p>The scale of China’s build-up of green energy capacity is only appreciated when compared to what other countries are doing. Fig. 4 shows the situation in terms of capacity to generate power from water, wind and sun, in 2015, comparing different industrial countries.</p>

<p>It is worth comparing China’s investments in green energy with the EU, making it clear that China has already caught up and is now in the lead. Drawing on data from BNEF and Xinhuanet, the London-based consultancy E3G published a chart revealing the widening gap between China and the EU. China invested over $110 billion in clean energy in 2015 (as we have seen), compared with just $40 billion for the EU – outranking the EU 2.5 times. China’s investment overtook that of the EU in 2013, and has strengthened its lead each year since then – while EU investment has actually declined. Per capita investment by China also overtook that of the EU in 2015, while China’s investment in clean energy as a proportion of its GDP has already reached 1% &#8212; compared with less than 0.3% for the EU.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Given this comparative dominance of China in building green energy infrastructure, it is all the more remarkable that international agreements such as the OECD-sponsored pact to limit subsidies for the export of coal-fired power stations (reached in the weeks prior to the Paris Climate deal of December 2015) leave China out of account.<sup>5</sup> Such omissions become increasingly untenable as China’s international influence rises.</p>
<p><strong>China’s manufacturing strategy</strong></p>
<p>Hao Tan and I have been at pains to emphasize that China has made a strategic choice in favour of renewables not (just) for reasons of mitigating climate change and reducing particulate pollution, but also (and probably more importantly) in terms of energy security. This is to be guaranteed by China’s strategic choice to manufacture all the devices needed for its renewable energy generation.</p>
<p>With solar panels, for example, China has been building up its manufacturing capacity rapidly, moving to a position of world leadership in 2007 – a full decade ago – as shown in Fig. 6.</p>

<p>The chart shows that China moved rapidly to world leadership by 2007, and to securing more than 50% of global output of solar panels by 2011. Now under the impact of trade sanctions brought against Chinese manufacturers, the companies like Trina Solar expanding into Thailand and Canadian Solar expanding into Vietnam are globalizing their activities, further cementing their leadership.</p>
<p>A similar story can be told for wind power, where again China has been building a strong national wind turbine manufacturing capacity, alongside its build-up of wind farms. By the year 2015 there were five Chinese firms in the world’s top ten wind turbine producers, with Goldwind emerging for the first time as the world’s number #1 producer.</p>
<p>China’s rapid expansion of manufacturing in wind turbines is reflected in the 2015 results for the world’s Top 10, with Chinese firm Goldwind emerging as world #1, followed by Danish firm Vestas and US firm GE in third place. [See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/11/china-overtakes-eu-to-become-global-wind-power-leader">“China overtakes EU to become global wind power leader”</a>] [See also <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chinese-wind-turbine-maker-is-now-world-s-largest/">“Chinese wind turbine maker is now world’s largest”</a>]</p>
<p>In 2015 Goldwind received orders for 7.8 GW of new turbines, followed by Vestas with 7.3 GW of new orders and GE with 5.9 GW of new orders. Four other Chinese firms ranked amongst the world’s top 10 – Guodian, MingYang, Envision and CSIC (Fig. 7).</p>

<p><strong>Greening of finance</strong></p>
<p>Behind these trends towards a greening of China’s energy system lies the power of finance – in this case, state-directed finance mediated via development banks. China is emerging as a leader in the financial aspects of the process of greening, driven by an appreciation of the crucial role of finance if ambitious investment strategies are to be successful. Brought together by Dr Ma Jun of the People’s Bank of China, the Green Finance Task Force in China issued its long-awaited report ‘Establishing China’s Green Financial System’ in April 2015 – making China the first country in the world to set specific guidelines for the issuing of green securities.<sup>6</sup> The report sets out an ambitious agenda for how China can green its rapidly developing financial and capital markets, making use of policy, regulatory and market-innovations. The report notes that China will need investment each year of at least 2 trillion yuan (US$320 billion) or more than 3 percent of GDP, for at least the next five years if it is to achieve its green targets.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>China’s banks are already moving into this new space for the issuance of green bonds. The Agricultural Bank of China was the first Chinese financial institution to do so, raising $1 billion from a three-part green bond in October 2015.<sup>8</sup> The green bond market in China is set to grow significantly as the government there has given the go-ahead to banks to launch large issues. The Shanghai Pudong Development Bank came out with a green bond worth 20 billion Yuan (US$4.3 billion) in January 2016. In its cautious but determined way, China is moving towards a quota for banks totalling 300 billion Yuan (more than US$45 billion) in green bond issues.<sup>9</sup> Thus the year 2015 has seen a decisive shift towards serious greening of finance, with China playing a significant role in this process.</p>
<p>As against these positive trends in greening of finance, it is also important to acknowledge that the year 2015 saw a considerable expansion of China’s development bank financing of infrastructure around the world, including new coal-fired power developments and fossil fueled projects in Africa, Central Asia and elsewhere. China’s ‘black’ energy economy is now internationalizing through the activities of China’s development banks, now the largest source of development finance in the world.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><strong>Counter trends</strong></p>
<p>While emphasizing the greening trends in this article, there are of course counter-trends that also need to be noted. As fast as China is adding solar and wind power to its national grid, the connection of these sources to the grid, and, as in many other countries, its capacity to accept input from fluctuating energy sources, is still limited. Curtailment of wind power contributions reached a high level in 2015, with cumulative wind power capacity reaching nearly 130 GW but only 100 GW of this supplying power to the grid.</p>
<p>The fact is that China is leading the world in upgrading its grid to make it stronger and smarter. The world’s largest electric utility, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGC) is now moving ahead with advanced plans to build long-range Direct Current power lines that lose less power during transmission than their AC counterparts. And the SGC is investing heavily in its grid upgrading activities. On the international front, the SGC is advancing its support for and promotion of the North East Asian Grid, connecting China, Mongolia, Japan, Korea and Russia. This is seen by the SGC as a means of enlarging the scope for renewable power to be utilized by the grid, and as a step towards the proposed Global Energy Interconnection, SGC’s most ambitious project to date. [See the <a href="http://store.elsevier.com/Global-Energy-Interconnection/Zhenya-Liu/isbn-9780128044056/">book outlining the proposal</a>]</p>
<p>No one really knows whether China’s efforts to green its economy and extend its greening efforts to the North East Asian Grid, for its own very practical economic and business reasons as much as for environmental reasons and reasons based on climate change considerations, will succeed. The commitments of decades towards the black, fossil-fueled system have been so enormous, and backed by powerful efforts to create a world class fossil fuel system that could mine, drill and transport huge quantities of coal, oil and gas to China’s fast-expanding manufacturing industry. Now the environmental and social price of this huge build-up has become clear, and China’s leadership is moving as rapidly as it can to change energy direction – with the results in 2015 indicating just how far these efforts are taking the country. But whether it will eventually prove to be sufficient, to save China and the world, is an open question.</p>

			<p><em>On September 4, the Syrian army and Hezbollah, supported by the Russian Aerospace Forces, have expelled Al Nusra Front terrorists and their allies from the Armament College and the Artillery College and nearby buildings at the Ramouseh Artillery Base in southwestern Aleppo. This move allowed the pro-government forces to set a full control of the road between Khan Tuman and the Ramouseh Neigborhood and besiege the militant-controlled areas of Aleppo city for the second time this summer.</em></p>
<p><em>In turn, Al Nusra terrorists, supported by other groups of the Jaish al-Fateh operation room, launched a counterattack in order to regain positions in the artillery base. By September 5, the pro-government forces have repelled the terrorists’ counter-attacks and now are securing the area.</em></p>
<p>The Russian Aerospace Forces made 75 air strikes on terrorist targets in southwestern Aleppo on September 4 and already made some 30 air strikes on September 5, supporting the pro-government forces there. Pro-government forces report that Al Nusra and its allies have lost from 100 to 200 fighters in these clashes.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bg5nykjn2G0" frameborder="0" width="690" height="400"></iframe></p>
<p>The Syrian army and its allies will likely continue their advance, attacking the Hikma School and the northern part of 1070 Apartment Project. Then, they will likely advance in the Ramouseh Neighborhood. These moves will allow the Syrian government to control successfully the perimeter of the besieged militant-controlled areas.</p>
<p>The Iraqi pro-government militia “Haraket al-Nujba” has captured of the Khan Tuman depots near the strategic town of Khan Tuman in southern Aleppo and the pro-government forces have seized the town of Qarassi. These will allow them to develop advance on the strategic town of Khan Tuman in southern Aleppo.</p>
<p>The Turkish-led forces in Syria have taken control of the 91km border between Azaz and Jarabulus, wiping out the ISIS terrorist group from the area.</p>
<p>Turkey’s Prime Minister Binali Yildirim announced on September 5 that Turkish Armed Forces and Turkish-backed militants had successfully expelled “terrorist organizations” from the area.</p>
<p>After securing the borderline between two strategic strongholds of Azaz and Jarabulus, the Turkey-led forces will likely advance on the ISIS-controlled logistical hub of Al-Bab. This will allow them to destroy the last hopes of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) to link the YPG-controlled areas in northern Syria.</p>
<p>2 Syrian soldiers were killed and 7 others wounded when a car bomb targeted the Bab Tadmor checkpoint at the entrance of al-Zahraa neighbourhood of Homs. The attack followed a failed joint offensive of Jund Al-Aqsa, Faylaq Al-Sham and the Free Syrian Army on the government-controlled town of Kawkab in the province of Hama. The Syrian army and Hezbollah killed over 30 terrorists and sestroyed 2 tanks and 2 BMPs in the clashes there. 4 battle tanks, 2 BMPs, and 5 vehicles with machine guns were reportedly seized by the pro-government forces.</p>
<p>The situation in the province remains tense. Recently, the loyalists have taken back Khirbat al-Hajamah and the Samsam hill and now are in control of a part of Ma’arda. Clashes are ongoing.</p>

			<div><em>Btaaboura is a tiny village in the mountains of northern Lebanon. It is connected to the main motorway by a narrow winding road. It could be just anywhere in the Christian part of this country: white stone houses, olive groves, wine grapes, bare hills.</em></div>
<div>
<p>Like elsewhere, the wealth is hardly backed by hard work. It is mainly sustained by remittances flowing from abroad. There are grotesquely luxurious cars everywhere &#8211; Audis, BMWs. And there is Western Union office on the main street. All doors are closed; nothing moves.</p>
<p>But this village is actually ‘unique’; different from all others in the area. At the entrance, there is a new park that shows the Brazilian and Lebanese flag fluttering side-by-side.</p>
<p>And across the street, a blue and white sign announces in Portuguese and Arabic: <em>RUA MICHEL TAMER PRESIDENTE DO BRAZIL.</em></p>
<p>In front of the word <em>PRESIDENTE</em>, there is a patch of blue spray paint. Later, I am told that just a few months ago it read, <em>VICE-PRESIDENTE</em>, but when Michel Temer ousted the legitimate President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, the Mayor of Btaaboura personally covered what he considered to be ‘outdated’ – the word <em>VICE</em> (Temer took office on August 31, 2016 after Rousseff&#8217;s impeachment and removal).</p>

<p>We inquired at a small grocery store, and soon we found the ancestral home of Michel Temer, <em>“Presidente do Brazil’</em>. Nizar Tamer (the local spelling), his cousin, was sitting in the garden, waving at us, inviting us in.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Come, sit down and rest. Have some figs and grapes: all local produce. You want to talk about Michel? But of course; why not?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Soon, the seating area begins to fill with other relatives and friends. Fruits are served. Everybody is smiling, joking, happy.</p>
<p>My head is heavy. I hardly slept the night before, shooting endless Tweets, denouncing the coup, ending my long chain of messages with words of unconditional support for Dilma, and with one Tweet depicting a battered Brazilian flag, accompanied by the text: <em>“Here is lesson one in essential Portuguese: FORA TEMER! = TEMER, GET OUT!”</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;If only they knew,”</em> I am thinking. And involuntarily, a bitter smile appears on my face.</p>
<p><em>“Yes, we are cousins,”</em> Nizar, a civil engineer, grins. <em>“His father left for Brazil, my father stayed in Lebanon&#8230;”</em></p>
<p>I am shown another house, right next door, where Michel Temer’s father was born. The house is around 200 years old, and it is totally dilapidated. But there are rumors now that it could soon be converted into a museum in honor of the ‘Presidente’.</p>
<p><em>“People in Lebanon are very proud of Michel,”</em> explain his relatives. “<em>When he came here last time, it was in 2011 or 2012, it was a huge event: some 100 security people, Brazilian embassy employees&#8230; Michel told us that he would raise economy in both Brazil and here.”</em></p>
<p>When Temer ‘became President’, the village organized a huge party, with fireworks, belly dancing, traditional music&#8230;</p>
<p>And what about the coup, the corruption? Do people here realize how he came to power?</p>
<p><em>Here, nobody cares about politics. He is now perhaps facing some problems, but these are his problems. We support him no matter what, because we are Lebanese, and because his roots are in Lebanon.</em>We eat figs and grapes. Then coffee is served.</p>
<p>Several women, miserable-looking Syrian refugees, are walking down the street, humble, scared, looking down at the road.</p>
<p>It is just two days before Dilma Rousseff addresses the Senate.</p>

<p>I could stay much longer, listening to slow-flowing stories about the man who is now helping the West to demolish socialist South America. But suddenly I feel nauseated; I want to vomit. Obviously, I had reached the limit, and we have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Will Brazil get &#8216;Lebanized&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p>Lebanon is a total mess &#8211; a collapsed country with nothing social or socialist whatsoever. Money, ‘business’, flashing wealth is all that matters here.</p>
<p>While Maserati and Porsche sports cars navigate around the potholes of Beirut, misery and filth are swallowing suburban areas. Garbage collection periodically collapses, the country is burning diesel to generate electricity (blackouts and water shortages are endemic). Less than 40 percent of children attend public (state) schools. Medical care is mostly abandoned to the market. There is virtually no public transportation, no city planning, hardly any parks or green areas.</p>
<p>Those who have money throw it around, proudly and vulgarly. There are obnoxiously rich marinas, while the restaurants in the capital are at least twice more expensive than in Paris.</p>
<p>And there is plenty of cash here: from filthy mining and other investments that are plundering West Africa, from drugs being grown in the Bekaa Valley, from those billions of dollars in remittances, and of course from banking (money laundering). Lebanon produces very little. It consumes excessively.</p>
<p>Its reputation in the Middle East is terrible, mainly thanks to the racism and arrogance of many of its citizens.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the only social force that stands above all religious and sectarian divides, is Hezbollah. But Hezbollah is closely linked to Syria and Iran’s government, and it fights ISIS in the mountains and across the border, as well as the several Israeli invasions and incursions into Lebanon. Predictably, the West put it on the terrorist list.</p>
<p>I keep imagining Brazil being governed by Mr. Temer and those like him. And I am frightened! What would happen to the majority of the people? Would they again become fully irrelevant and forgotten, like here in Lebanon?</p>
<p>Would the country function only in order to serve big business, the elites? Would the success of the entire nation be judged by the size of marinas and by the size of luxury cars in the parking lots of grossly overpriced restaurants and clubs?</p>
<p>Instead of being an example to the world, would Brazil get brutally Lebanized? The West would definitely like that, as it worked so hard to make it happen in the first place.</p>
<p>But in the name of Brazilian people, the rot, this deadly destruction has to be stopped.</p>
<p>Before leaving Btaaboura village, I stop my car for a few moments. And suddenly I see it: the beautiful and dear Brazilian flag is not waving in the wind. It is torn, dirty and looks like a rag. And there in front of the entrance to the park garbage lies strewn everywhere.</p>

<p><em>If we require a shield [against people smugglers] we should leave that up to Australian Border Force, our Navy, the AFP and our intelligence services.</em></p>
<p><em>Paris Aristotle, Lateline, Sep 5, 2016.</em></p>
<p>Unthinkable, that is, in Australia.  Unthinkable to finally accept that the international pathways of asylum seekers and refugees can know no discrimination, and that each country duly receiving them should do all within their powers to facilitate their rapid process and exit into the community.  Unthinkable to not shift the burden of processing and settlement to impoverished, or poorer countries.</p>
<p>Several outstanding features of international refugee law somehow taper out by the time Australian officials come to the party. That, for instance, of <em>non-refoulement</em>, explicitly prohibited by Article 33 of the UN Refugee Convention.</p>
<p>Officials in Canberra have for some years shown a certain indifference to returning refugees or those being determined as refugees to a place where they might fear persecution, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrarily deprived of life.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Jane McAdam, “Australia is the only country whose law explicitly says it is ‘irrelevant’ whether or not our<em>non-refoulement</em> obligations are engaged when removing an asylum seeker” (<em>Guardian</em>, Sep 6).</p>
<p>The corpus of international refugee law, in fact, has trouble getting a look in when it comes to Australia’s domestic legislation, which insists on designating “irregular arrivals” persona non grata.  This sets the tone for the distinctly punitive approach towards those who end up in such legal lacunae such as Nauru and Manus Island.  (The latter will, in due course, be mercifully closed as illegal under Papua New Guinea’s laws.)</p>
<p>The <em>Migration Act 1958</em> (Cth) remains a poor excuse on that score, feeble in its nods to international precedents. That said, the odd provision does guide ministerial discretion, which is not tyrannically absolute.This was the case when the sordid exercise known as the Malaysia Solution came to a dramatic halt in the Australian High Court’s <em>M70</em> 2011 decision, which found the immigration minister’s decision to deem Malaysia a safe relocation destination for Australia’s refugees questionable.</p>
<p>Offshore detention became the obscene moral incentive to combat the idea of “people smuggling” when it was merely a political move to give the electorate the muscular impression that Canberra was regaining control of its borders.  The language in combating such illegal arrivals became packed with military metaphors.</p>
<p>The camp solution was packaged by political spin experts as a moral conversion of the left faction in the Australian Labor Party then in power, after the deaths of 50 arrivals on the rocks of Christmas Island in December 2010.</p>
<p>Targeting an abstract market supposedly populated by ruthless criminals, Australia proceeded to attack those deemed beneficiaries of it.  It could hardly be those making money from it. After all, Canberra occasionally sponsors smugglers to move refugee arrivals to Indonesia in atrocious conditions.  As always, it was those essentially placed outside the protective frameworks of states that have long abandoned them who would continue to suffer.</p>
<p>On Monday, one of the architects of the ghastly program, Paris Aristotle of the Victorian Foundation for the Survivors of Torture, made the trite point that terrible miscalculations had taken place.  It was evident that he lacked that worthiness of the Greek philosopher of his name, described by Dante Alighieri as being, “Il maestro di color che sanno” (The master of those who know).</p>
<p>Portrayed in Australian media as a gritty visionary with oodles of compassion (another convert to the Christmas Island deaths in 2010), his perspectives have shown a distinct lack of imagination, making much hay from the notion that offshore processing in poorer states would somehow be a good idea.  And it would save lives.</p>
<p>“It was never envisaged,” he claimed gravely, “that we would leave people there for long, long periods of time without giving them a sense that we were working towards providing them with a decent resettlement outcome.”</p>
<p>Aristotle reminded the interviewer on ABC’s <em>Lateline</em> program that there was a necessary priority in dealing “with people smuggling… we also then can’t resort to strategies ultimately that enable children, women and men to be used as some form of a human shield against people smuggling.”[1]</p>
<p>Aristotle has, it would seem, been re-converted. Or he simply made a mistake.  A closer look at it reveals otherwise: Aristotle remains, for all his grief, convinced that some form of processing in such theatres is permissible as long as it is done quickly. The line parrots that of the ALP, which has no desire to relinquish the “turn back the boats” policy or outsourcingAustralia’s refugee obligations. Do not, in other words, come toAustralia.</p>
<p>More shocks to the system will be needed; more successful legal challenges mounted against the offshore idea; a spate of gruesome whistleblowing revelations that further reveal the conditions of camp brutality and human degradation.  A return to the normality of onshore processing and settlement is required; in other words, a return to what has become the unthinkable.</p>

			<p><em>We are ogres of the North</em></p>
<p><em>Those of you from Fukushima, please stand. Hello, everyone! I came here from Fukushima. I came today with many busloads of companions from Fukushima Prefecture and from the places where we’ve evacuated.<sup>1</sup></em></p>
<p>These unassuming words begin the speech that electrified the 60,000-some gathered under an intense autumn sun for an anti-nuke rally in Meiji Park on September 19, 2011. Six months had passed since the triple disaster. The rally was dramatic evidence for a world that had forgotten the first postwar decades that Japanese people could, and indeed do, protest. Mutō’s speech spread over the internet, over the archipelago and into the world. Six months later, she would be heading The <a href="http://kokuso-fukusimagenpatu.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_5112.html">Complainants for Criminal Prosecution of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster</a>, whose activities represent the most sustained, and to date, only successful effort to seek criminal prosecution of individuals responsible for the Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>What are the features of that speech that have given it a distinctive place in the annals of postwar Japanese movements? What does it tell us about the kind of leader Mutō has become and the movement she represents?</p>
<p>First of all, it is beautiful. Whether in Japanese or English translation, its lyrical precision invites reproduction in the form of poetry. Take the lines invoking the choices pressed upon people in the early aftermath of the disaster:</p>
<blockquote><p>To flee, or not to flee.</p>
<p>To eat, or not to eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To hang out the wash, or not.</p>
<p>To make children wear masks, or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To plough our fields, or not.</p>
<p>To protest to someone, or remain silent.</p></blockquote>

<p>How deftly they capture the relentless tension of those days, both for those who lived it and for those learning about it. Care of selection makes the activities convincingly representative, as social roles with particular textures of exposure threat. The beauty makes their rehearsal bearable, and the ability to hold these painful experiences in mind creates an opening to action, invoked in some of the most memorable lines of the speech that respond to the warning, “’Do not take us for fools/Do not rob us of life’”:</p>
<p>We are ogres of the North</p>
<p>quietly burning</p>
<p>the fuel of our anger.</p>
<p>“Division,” or <em>bundan</em>, continues to be a recurrent word designating one of the thorniest problems afflicting Fukushima. It might be said that TEPCO and the state expend what ingenuity they have in exercising the principle of “divide and conquer.” This speech acknowledges the pain of division, explicitly and implicitly: people have responded in opposing ways to the series of choices, so-called, enumerated above. Because of the pervasive, invasive anxiety produced by the prospect of exposure, neighbors are readily threatened by neighbors’ decisions about mundane and definitive life choices. Mutō draws them together as “ogres of the North” (Tohoku), reminding them of their centuries-old union as dominated peoples capable of mounting resistance against centralized power.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the modest opening, the insistence that the speaker is one of a large group of suffering, determined people, some of whom have left, others staying behind. As Tomomi Yamaguchi explicates in a thorough discussion of the formation of the Complainants group, Mutō, through her predilection for women’s nonviolent direct action in her antinuclear activism extending back to Chernobyl (1986), is a believer in shared organizational leadership, the principle of the “level field.”<sup>2</sup> Katsuya Hirano’s<a href="http://apjjf.org/2016/17/Hirano.html">interview</a> reveals how the elements manifested in the September 2011 speech translate into the kind of leadership she has developed in a movement involving men and women in the arena of the law, a nonviolent stage, to be sure, but one of abstraction, impersonality, and temporal delay.</p>
<p><em>Legal struggles</em></p>
<p>At present, there are approximately 30 Fukushima-nuclear-disaster-related cases making their way through the courts. They take the form of “group litigation” (<em>shūdan soshō</em>, not to be confused with American-style “class action suits”),<sup>3</sup> involving more than ten thousand plaintiffs.<sup>4</sup> Among environmental lawsuits, the Okinawa Kadena Air Base Noise Pollution suit (3<sup>rd</sup> round, 2011), with 22,000 plaintiffs, is said to be the largest, but the Fukushima lawsuits already exceed the 8,000 involved over the years in the Minamata mercury poisoning case, the largest of the “Big Four” pollution cases.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>As an outgrowth of work with the Complainants, Mutō Ruiko helped organize a national group, <a href="http://hidanren.blogspot.com/">Hidanren</a>(Gempatsu Jiko Higaisha Dantai Renrakukai, or the Liaison Council of Victims of the Nuclear Disaster). Established in May of 2015, it continues to seek affiliates for mutual support, including pooling the knowledge gathered along the arduous path of legally challenging the state and the nuclear industry. Although many of the names of membership organizations, including “observers,” take the form of “xx [place, often an evacuation location] Nuclear Power Plaintiffs,” others give a more vivid sense of plaintiff identity: The Association for the Trial Seeking to Protect Children from Radiation Exposure; The Association to Protect Evacuee Life; Plaintiffs in the If Only Nuclear Power Had Not Existed Trial; “Give Us Back Our Livelihood, Give Us Back Our Land”: Fukushima Nuclear Power Plaintiffs; Denouncing Nuclear Power Damage: Fukushima Petitioners of Iitate Village. The last-named group is engaged in an ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) procedure outside the courtroom. Individuals and groups, including prefectural governments, have had recourse to ADR in the hopes of swift settlement, Many have been disappointed, however, by TEPCO’s refusal to accept the sums suggested by a national dispute resolution center and ended up going to court.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Two major categories of claims have emerged from these struggles: compensation for loss, psychological as well as material, and support for continued evacuation. It goes without saying that the government and TEPCO wish to minimize such forms of expenditure, and that that wish is inextricable from the desire to minimize, preferably to deny altogether, the impact of the nuclear disaster, thus safeguarding the role of nuclear power in the Japanese energy mix as well as overseas sales. The migration of the “safety myth” from nuclear power itself to radiation exposure can be traced in the breathtakingly cynical redefinition of safety as measured in air dose rate from the government’s original decontamination goal of 1 mSv per year to up to 20 mSv per year.</p>
<p>The threshold of 20 mSv per year, averaged over five years, is the ICRP (International Commission for Radiological Protection) standard for industry workers, not the general public.<sup>7</sup> Combining the announcement of compensation cutoffs (for mental anguish and damage to business) with lifting evacuation orders from “preparing-to-lift-evacuation-order zones” and “residency-restricted zones”(most recently, on July 12 of 2016) effectively reinforces the new safety campaign,<sup>8</sup> which, moreover, must have completed its work in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. It was in September of 2013 that Prime Minister Abe, bidding for the Olympics in London, declared Fukushima to be “under control.” Now Mr. Abe is even suggesting reopening parts of the “difficult-to-return zones.”<sup>9</sup> In the meanwhile, compensation payments, like the initial designation of concentric zones of risk/safety, with their inevitable semblance of arbitrariness, have yielded the by-product of suspicion and resentment, in other words, division.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>An especially urgent target of struggle is the cut-off of housing aid, announced for March 2017, to so-called “voluntary” evacuees. Because they left without government orders, they have been eligible only for housing assistance under a general disaster relief law. Their very status as “voluntary” evacuees is the result, of course, of the excruciatingly parsimonious designation of zones warranting departure. The anxiety understandably provoked by general awareness of the sensitivity of children to radioactivity—even or especially among those who have thought themselves unable to leave—has made this a distinctly fraught issue. “Don’t you love Fukushima? Why do you want to hurt it?” is the sort of question leveled at parents who have stayed away.<sup>11</sup> The imminent cut-off of housing aid for evacuee families, most of whom have had to maintain two households, means that “parents must now choose between submitting their children to poverty or to radiation exposure.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<p><em>The mission of the Fukushima Complainants</em></p>
<p>The organization Mutō Ruiko heads, The Complainants for Criminal Prosecution of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, shares the concerns of the civil suits referred to above. What distinguishes it, then? Citizens can file a criminal complaint with the police or prosecutors when they believe that a crime has been committed but has not been pursued by the police or prosecutors. To do so is to insist that responsible parties be identified by public authorities and not just by private citizens who feel they have sustained injuries. In the case of Fukushima, it is a refusal to accept the nuclear disaster, let alone its aftermath, as an act of nature. Unlike the civil suits, compensation is not the object. In the words of the Complainants:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are people who have had to leave behind our hometowns.</p>
<p>We are people who continue to live, exposed to radiation, in our transformed hometowns.</p>
<p>We are people who suffer, feeling the suffering of our neighbors as our own.</p>
<p>And we are people who seek to put an end to the repetition of the tragic history of this country in which sacrifices are imposed on human beings in the name of the economy, corporations, and the state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What caused this accident?</p>
<p>Why were actions taken that have augmented the damage?</p>
<p>We must elucidate the truth and halt the damage caused by the continuing disaster.</p>
<p>Those who should be held responsible should take responsibility and make amends for their errors.</p>
<p>We must make use of the resources provided by a democratic society.</p>
<p>In the act of filing our complaint,</p>
<p>from the depths of our anger and sorrow,</p></blockquote>
<p>As Mutō observes to Hirano, recognition of oneself as a victim demands effort, especially when social conditioning suggests that life and livelihood are more secure if one is numb to exploitation. Without establishing the truth about responsibility, both the prevention of future repetition and mitigation of ongoing harm are hamstrung; without acknowledging victimization, the harm itself remains obscure. These elements are interdependent in the logic of this complaint.</p>
<p>This simple yet profound logic was fleshed out into legal documents bearing the names of 1324 Complainants, ages 7 to 87, all residing in Fukushima at the time of the explosions, and of 33 accused parties, filed in the Fukushima District Public Prosecutors Office. The 33 included officials of TEPCO, heads of relevant government agencies, and medical experts.<sup>14</sup> Of these, only 3 remain as defendants in the forthcoming criminal trial. In the Hirano <a href="http://apjjf.org/2016/17/Hirano.html">interview</a>, Mutō especially regrets the difficulty of pursuing the responsibility of medical authorities: they have played a leading role in “augmenting the damage” by minimizing health risk, with consequential policy decisions. Filing in Fukushima rather than Tokyo reflected the hope that local government officials might be mindful of their own vulnerable humanity, shared with other residents of the prefecture. In the event, the complaint was moved to Tokyo, lumped with two others, and summarily dismissed on September 9, 2013, the day after Prime Minister Abe secured the 2020 Olympics.</p>
<p>The Complainants then had recourse to a relatively novel institution, the committee for inquest of prosecution (<em>kensatsu shinsakai</em>), consisting of 11 randomly selected citizens with an attorney serving in an advisory capacity. (Readers may envisage something comparable to the US grand jury, but without prosecutorial involvement.) The requisite majority of 8 found three of the accused “appropriate for indictment,” whereupon the case was sent back to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors, who once again elected not to indict. The last resort of the Complainants was a new committee for inquest of prosecution. In July of 2015, this committee, too, decided in favor of the indictment of three TEPCO executives. This, then, triggered a mandatory indictment, with five attorneys—an unprecedented number—appointed by the Tokyo District Court to serve as a prosecution team.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">When will the trial actually begin? That is unclear; the prosecution has filed its materials, but the pretrial conference procedure may be protracted. Still, given the demonstrated unwillingness of the public prosecutors to indict under a political regime committed to nuclear restarts, it is a near-miracle that a criminal trial is slated to take place. With the Minamata mercury poisoning case, it was 1976, a quarter of a century after the first signs of disease when the Kumamoto Public Prosecutors indicted the former head of Chisso Corporation and the factory supervisor. It is also the case that preceding civil lawsuits yielded a Kumamoto District Court decision in 1973 that may prove especially relevant to the Fukushima case: in response to Chisso Corporation’s argument that because the appearance of Minamata Disease in Kumamoto was unprecedented, it could not have anticipated the health impact of its procedures, the court held that a chemical factory had a special “duty of care” with respect to the impact of effluents on the lives and health of surrounding residents.<sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p>The Minamata precedent, legally, politically, and socially, is, however, mostly sobering for Fukushima. Even a welcome, newly awakened sense of empathy among victims of environmental disaster has its distracting, potentially harmful aspects: as Mutō makes emphatically clear in her conversation with Hirano, mercury poisoning and radioactive contamination must not be conflated. Whatever the good will underlying proposals to show support by adopting Fukushima produce in Minamata area school lunches, not only is there no guarantee that only uncontaminated items will be shipped, but such gestures feed into the safety myth by accepting the rhetoric of “eat and support” (<em>tabete ouen</em>) and “reputational damage.” More generally, there are worries that the divisions and protracted pain of Minamata are being repeated in Fukushima.<sup>16</sup> The trial will certainly result in the disclosure of valuable information <em>for the public record</em>. Given that the tsunami has buttressed TEPCO’s insistence that what happened was an unforeseeable natural disaster, internal evidence indicating willful dismissal of recommendations for taking protective measures for the sake of economizing will be key.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Underscoring, by unfortunate contrast, the Complainants’ unusual victory in securing criminal prosecution is the recent (June 23, 2016), swift decision by a committee for inquest of prosecution on a separate complaint launched by the Fukushima Complainants to the Fukushima prefectural police in 2013, arguing that the continued release of extraordinary volumes of contaminated water into the Pacific constituted a pollution crime. The police refused to charge TEPCO executives, and the judicial inquest committee concurred. For the time being, it seems unlikely that unfettered contamination of the ocean by a range of radionuclides, presumably a matter of international concern, will be examined in the courtroom.</p>
<p><em>To find the next step: despair and truth</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) Not a day goes by when I am not tormented by shame and guilt that “my continuing to teach here is the cause for children to be exposed to radiation.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(2) The words of well-meaning outsiders—“It’s dangerous,” “Why don’t you try to escape?” bring only more pain to those who have stayed behind. Someone even said to me, “You’re the one who’s murdering the kids.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(3) I can no longer meet with the friends and acquaintances I’ve made&#8230;. Some of them I’ve lost. Because I evacuated, a psychological gulf, a division, has set in between me and friends and acquaintances who didn’t or couldn’t.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Especially in the process of soliciting the first round of Complainants—anyone, regardless of age or nationality, residing in Fukushima in March 2011—Mutō and her partners took pains to support self-examination. One record of that “conscious effort to become aware of [one’s] victimhood” is a selection of fifty statements by Complainants from that first round, collected and published in 2013 The presentation is a novel one, by age of writer at the time of the triple disaster, ranging from 7 to 87. Beginning with its evident respect for losses suffered by children, this arrangement of expressions of grief, anger, and anxiety becomes a richly concrete composite of life stages gone badly awry thanks to the nuclear disaster itself and its handling in the continuing aftermath.</p>

<p>If courageous effort is required to name oneself a victim willing to accuse others of a crime, then additional effort becomes necessary in order to reveal the grounds for that decision in a publication. Of the fifty statements in this booklet, the writers of 26 are presented anonymously, through initials, place of residence or evacuation, occupation, or no identifying information whatsoever except for gender. Interestingly, 33 of the writers are female, 17, male. Of the former, 24 are anonymous in contrast to 2 of the latter. Was there a striking preponderance of female Complainants, or did they tend to write more vividly, tying the harm they had suffered to their life experiences? And having permitted publication, why were they proportionately more inclined to seek anonymity?</p>
<p>“To flee, or not to flee” was the first example Mutō gave in her 2011 speech of pressing decisions forced on Fukushima residents. The heavy consequences of choices made are exemplified in the excerpts from three statements quoted above. Examples (1) and (2) show the risk incurred in choosing to stay and, especially, continuing to work with children. The first is by Yamauchi Naoko, a special needs teacher; the second, by Sasaki Michinori, a Buddhist priest and head of a kindergarten associated with his temple, himself the father of young children. (Mutō recounts Sasaki’s asking Dr. Yamashita Shun’ichi, the prefectural medical adviser summoned from Nagasaki— he of laugh-and-ye-shall-not-be-touched-by-radiation fame—whether he would bring his own grandchildren to play in the sandboxes of Nihonmatsu; Sasaki and especially his wife Ruri play key roles in Kamanaka Hitomi’s documentary, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVfW68BiSu8"><em>Little Voices from Fukushima</em></a>.<sup>19</sup>) Example (3) comes from a statement by an anonymous woman who has evacuated to Hiroshima with her child, leaving her husband to work in Fukushima. Their appearance together in these pages is precious because even though they have given opposite answers to that first, critical question, they have not turned against each other: all three are Complainants, willing to attest to the harm inflicted on them and in the case of the first two, <em>continuing anxiety</em> about staying on.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/152043018">Five years</a> after the beginning of the catastrophe, and one year after Hirano’s <a href="http://apjjf.org/2016/17/Hirano.html">interview</a> of Mutō, the tension between those who left and those who stayed behind has only grown. For those who stay on, and especially for those with children, any suggestion of health risks is ever more unwelcome. (There is yet another group, those who give up and return, who may become the most ardent believers in Fukushima safety.<sup>20</sup>) “Reconstruction” seems undeniably real, embodied in the dump trucks hurtling along with their loads of soil carved out of mountainsides to replace what had been removed in decontamination<sup>21</sup> and construction materials for the convenience stores and community centers to anchor the replacement habitats. Should we pause over the young women who direct traffic along the dusty routes, without the protection of even the most casual of masks? No doubt this is a precious form of employment in the region. Why should such forward-looking efforts be hampered by the possibility of ill health for who knows how many years hence? What if the road now traversed mainly by dump trucks were to become part of the Olympic torch route?<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>Fukushima health anxiety intertwines two potent strands of dread: (1) fear of illness and (2) fear of discrimination, tracing its way back to the hibakusha of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Together, they sustain a regime of mutual surveillance and self-censorship as pervasive and penetrating as anything the state could wish for. Of course, we should note the role of radioactivity’s inaccessibility to our senses and the delayed appearance of health effects in shaping the ways in which anxiety is expressed—or not expressed. Kawai Hiroyuki, a lead attorney for the Fukushima Complainants, points to the peculiar lacuna—“like the missing center piece of a jigsaw puzzle”—at the heart of all Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) cases and the lawsuits involving more than 10,000 plaintiffs: they all concern compensation for property or mental anguish, but the reason why the plaintiffs seek compensation for their property and mental anguish, that is, fear of illness, goes unaddressed, stymied by the insistence on the part of medical experts that “it is difficult to think” (<em>kangae nikui</em>) that there is a causal relationship between manifest evidence of illness, especially childhood thyroid cancer, with the nuclear accident.</p>

<p>Kawai made this observation at a remarkable event, the press conference announcing the launch of the 311 Thyroid Cancer Family Association on March 12, 2016.<sup>23</sup> Three advisers of the group—a former local politician and a physician, along with Kawai—made this an exceptionally informative public event.<sup>24</sup> But it was above all the format of the occasion that made it unforgettable. Billed as a “coming out” (<em>kamingu auto</em>), appropriately enough, since patients and their families had not appeared in public, the press conference had journalists gathered in a room in Tokyo, and two fathers appearing via Skype from Fukushima—but with only their torsos showing and their voices altered. To facilitate Q&amp;A, one was dressed mostly in white, hence, referred to as “the person in white,” and the other became “the person in black.” The fathers recounted with careful, almost painful, restraint their and their children’s experiences through diagnosis and surgery, what they were told and not told. They wanted to know, if the nuclear disaster wasn’t the cause, what was responsible for their children’s disease?</p>

<p>This was meant to be, and in context, indeed was, a hopeful beginning: the beginning of the end to an isolation compounding the devastation of one’s child’s serious illness following a catastrophe. And we must imagine the courageous determination required of these fathers to speak to the press.</p>
<p>And yet. Why could it happen only in this guise? What historical experiences (the atomic bombings, of course, but also Hansen’s Disease, tuberculosis, etc.) and social structures have made it apparently necessary for victims to present themselves as if they were the wrongdoers? No one should be forced into disclosing a stigmatizing condition, but how can the condition be addressed and the stigma challenged, if enjoining secrecy is the kindest solution society is prepared to offer?<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>In 2012, Hiroshima hibakusha Matsumoto Akiko wondered, “Like most children, I did as I was told and didn’t let anyone know I was a hibakusha. What if all of us hibakusha hadn’t tried to keep our identities secret? Would Fukushima have happened?”<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There is a remarkable moment in Hirano’s <a href="http://apjjf.org/2016/17/Hirano.html">interview</a> of Mutō Ruiko when she embarks on an elaboration of why she doesn’t want a movement motivated by fear, even if “radiation is &#8230; terrifying.” She goes on to say, “I want to take on despair, too, and despair properly.” She deflects Hirano’s invitation to describe this as a process leading to hope. Rather, she insists on the importance of <em>knowing</em>: “I’m the kind of person who wants to know. I want to know the truth.”</p>
<p>What might it mean to embrace despair, despair over “what our country is doing to us”—denying, in effect, that something irreversible had happened, thereby obstructing the possibility of genuine remediation, a remediation that would put life first. As time passes, this denial drives more and more weary people to collude in the denial of their victimization and to continue to place themselves and their children at risk. Mutō observes, but does not criticize such people. In those exhausting but suddenly hopeful days when the trauma was still fresh, when 60,000 people turned out to say good-bye to nuclear power, she had urged, “However cruel our path, let us not avert our gaze, let us support each other.”</p>
<p>Born on August 15, she was given the name Ruiko (類子) by parents who associated that day with “humanity.”</p>
<p><em>My warm thanks go to Kats Hirano for letting me participate in this project and to Mark Selden for his inordinate editorial patience. I thank Mutō Ruiko for living as she does. I also want to thank people living in Fukushima or northern Kantō and Osaka (as evacuees) who have shared their stories. Whenever I think about them and others I will never meet, I want to say, “I’m sorry for how I speak and write about you, even as I know that I can’t ever fully know what you are experiencing.”</em></p>

			<p><em>Recently, a compelling photo of a bleeding and seemingly confused young Syrian boy seated in an ambulance in Aleppo was widely distributed and commented upon in domestic and international news media.  In response, some journalists have called for the Obama Administration to &#8220;take action,&#8221; including bombing government military targets in Syria.</em></p>
<p>Veterans For Peace feels great sympathy for all of the victims in Syria, and for all who have lost family members, friends and loved ones in this terrible war.</p>
<p>Many of us are veterans of military conflicts that were sold to the American public with emotionally compelling but misleading messages and images. We recognize and denounce the manipulation of selected images of human suffering as propaganda used to justify yet further military violence, which will only lead to more death and suffering. Why are we not seeing images of suffering on both sides of the war in Syria?  Why is an image of an injured boy used to call for yet more violence?</p>
<p>The &#8220;no fly zones&#8221; and &#8220;safe zones&#8221; that some pundits are calling for in Syria are acts of war that would lead to more violence and destruction, as happened in Libya, a nation that was virtually destroyed by a so-called &#8220;humanitarian intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p>“No-fly zones&#8221; and “safe zones” would put U.S. Air Force pilots in direct military confrontation with Russian Air Force pilots, leading to a dangerous military escalation between two nuclear powers &#8211; an existential threat to all life on earth.</p>
<p>The widely seen photo of the young Syrian boy is just the latest and most graphic example of the psychological warfare being waged against public opinion in the U.S. and worldwide.  Almost every day, the media misrepresents the conflict in Syria as a fight between democracy-loving “rebels” and the “brutal dictator Assad.”  What is actually happening in Syria is foreign intervention to destroy the last secular, multi-religious nation in the Middle East.  Violent extremist groups are receiving arms, training, and support from the United States, and billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two undemocratic monarchies who have their own reasons for seeking “regime change” in Syria.</p>
<div id="blockStyle13336Body264"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0px;" src="https://www.veteransforpeace.org/files/cache/1acf9fd3e968e0cd8db072b5bf49f07c_f860.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" border="0" /></div>
<p>We believe that the only way to resolve the crisis in Syria and to assist the victims of this conflict is to end the fighting, not to escalate it. The Syrian people have the right to elect their leaders and to determine their own future.</p>
<p>We call on the United States government to cease all military, political and economic assistance to armed opposition groups in Syria and to take actions to pressure US allies to do the same.</p>
<p>Veterans For Peace further calls for an end to all economic sanctions against Syria, especially of medicines, including much needed cancer medicines.</p>
<p>We call on the U.S. government to provide massive humanitarian assistance for the millions of Syrian refugees, and to allow more Syrian refugees into the United States.</p>
<p>The Syrian Government has the right to defend itself from foreign aggression and the “regime change” schemes of the United States and its allies.  We call on the all parties to do their utmost to avoid killing innocent civilians.</p>
<p>It is time to bring the Syrian war to an end.  It is time to begin the hard work of healing the wounds of the terrible war that has been imposed upon the people of Syria.  We must take responsibility for the role of our own government.  We must allow the people of Syria and the Middle East to live in peace.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 6th, 2016</strong> by Jean Bricmont</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><em>Ever since the 1990s, and especially since the Kosovo war in 1999, anyone who opposes armed interventions by Western powers and NATO has to confront what may be called an anti-anti-war left (including its far left segment).  In Europe, and notably in France, this anti-anti-war left is made up of the mainstream of social democracy, the Green parties and most of the radical left.  The anti-anti-war left does not come out openly in favor of Western military interventions and even criticizes them at times (but usually only for their tactics or alleged motivations – the West is supporting a just cause, but clumsily and for oil or for geo-strategic reasons).   </em></p>
<p>But most of its energy is spent issuing “warnings” against the supposed dangerous drift of that part of the left that remains firmly opposed to such interventions.  It calls upon us to show solidarity with the “victims” against “dictators who kill their own people”, and not to give in to knee-jerk anti-imperialism, anti-Americanism, or anti-Zionism, and above all not to end up on the same side as the far right.  After the Kosovo Albanians in 1999, we have been told that “we” must protect Afghan women, Iraqi Kurds and more recently the people of Libya and of Syria.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the anti-anti-war left has been extremely effective. The Iraq war, which was sold to the public as a fight against an imaginary threat, did indeed arouse a fleeting opposition, but there has been very little opposition on the left to interventions presented as “humanitarian”, such as the bombing of Yugoslavia to detach the province of Kosovo, the bombing of Libya to get rid of Gaddafi, or the current intervention in Syria.   Any objections to the revival of imperialism or in favor of peaceful means of dealing with such conflicts have simply been brushed aside by invocations of “R2P”, the right or responsibility to protect, or the duty to come to the aid of a people in danger.</p>
<p>The fundamental ambiguity of the anti-anti-war left lies in the question as to who are the “we” who are supposed to intervene and protect.  One might ask the Western left, social movements or human rights organizations the same question Stalin addressed to the Vatican, “How many divisions do you have?”  As a matter of fact, all the conflicts in which “we” are supposed to intervene are armed conflicts.  Intervening means intervening <em>militarily</em> and for that, one needs the appropriate <em>military</em> means. It is perfectly obvious that the Western left does not possess those means.  It could call on European armies to intervene, instead of the United States, but they have never done so without massive support from the United States.  So in reality the actual message of the anti-anti-war left is: “Please, oh Americans, make war not love!” Better still, inasmuch as since their debacle in Afghanistan and in Iraq, the Americans are leery of sending in ground troops, the message amounts to nothing other than asking the U.S. Air Force to go bomb countries where human rights violations are reported to be taking place.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone is free to claim that human rights should henceforth be entrusted to the good will of the U.S. government, its bombers, its missile launchers and its drones.  But it is important to realize that that is the concrete meaning of all those appeals for “solidarity” and “support” to rebel or secessionist movements involved in armed struggles.  Those movements have no need of slogans shouted during “demonstrations of solidarity” in Brussels or in Paris, and that is not what they are asking for.  They want to get heavy weapons and see their enemies bombed.</p>
<p>The anti-anti-war left, if it were honest, should be frank about this choice, and openly call on the United States to go bomb wherever human rights are violated; but then it should accept the consequences.  In fact, the political and military class that is supposed to save the populations “massacred by their dictators” is the same one that waged the Vietnam war, that imposed sanctions and wars on Iraq, that imposes arbitrary sanctions on Cuba, Iran and any other country that meets with their disfavor, that provides massive unquestioning support to Israel, which uses every means including coups d’état to oppose social reformers in Latin America, from Arbenz to Chavez by way of Allende, Goulart and others, and which shamelessly exploits workers and resources the world over.  One must be quite starry-eyed to see in that political and military class the instrument of salvation of “victims”, but that is in practice exactly what the anti-anti-war left is advocating, because, given the relationship of forces in the world, there is no other military force able to impose its will.</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. government is scarcely aware of the existence of the anti-anti-war left.  The United States decides whether or not to wage war according to the chances of succeeding and to their own assessment of their strategic, political and economic interests. And once a war is begun, they want to win at all costs. It makes no sense to ask them to carry out only good interventions, against genuine villains, using gentle methods that spare civilians and innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>For example, those who call for “saving Afghan women” are in fact calling on the United States to intervene and, among other things, bomb Afghan civilians and shoot drones at Pakistan. It makes no sense to ask them to protect but not to bomb, because armies function by shooting and bombing.<a title="" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/04/beware-the-anti-anti-war-left/#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>A favorite theme of the anti-anti-war left is to accuse those who reject military intervention of “supporting the dictator”, meaning the leader of the currently targeted country.  The problem is that every war is justified by a massive propaganda effort which is based on demonizing the enemy, especially the enemy leader.  Effectively opposing that propaganda requires contextualizing the crimes attributed to the enemy and comparing them to those of the side we are supposed to support. That task is necessary but risky; the slightest mistake will be endlessly used against us, whereas all the lies of the pro-war propaganda are soon forgotten.</p>
<p>Already, during the First World War, Bertrand Russell and British pacifists were accused of “supporting the enemy”.  But if they denounced Allied propaganda, it was not out of love for the German Kaiser, but in the cause of peace.  The anti-anti-war left loves to denounce the “double standards” of coherent pacifists who criticize the crimes of their own side more sharply than those attributed to the enemy of the moment (Milosevic, Gaddafi, Assad, and so on), but this is only the necessary result of a deliberate and legitimate choice: to counter the war propaganda of our own media and political leaders (in the West), propaganda which is based on constant demonization of the enemy under attack accompanied by idealization of the attacker.</p>
<p>The anti-anti-war left has no influence on American policy, but that doesn’t mean that it has no effect.  Its insidious rhetoric has served to neutralize any peace or anti-war movement.  It has also made it impossible for any European country to take such an independent position as France took under De Gaulle, or even Chirac, or as Sweden did with Olof Palme.  Today such a position would be instantly attacked by the anti-anti-war left, which is echoed by European media, as “support to dictators”, another “Munich”, or “the crime of indifference”.</p>
<p>What the anti-anti-war left has managed to accomplish is to destroy the sovereignty of Europeans in regard to the United States and to eliminate any independent left position concerning war and imperialism. It has also led most of the European left to adopt positions in total contradiction with those of the Latin American left and to consider as adversaries countries such as China and Russia which seek to defend international law, as indeed they should.</p>
<p>When the media announce that a massacre is imminent, we hear at times that action is “urgent” to save the alleged future victims, and time cannot be lost making sure of the facts.  This may be true when a building is on fire in one’s own neighborhood, but such urgency regarding other countries ignores the manipulation of information and just plain error and confusion that dominate foreign news coverage.  Whatever the political crisis abroad, the instant “we must do something” reflex brushes aside serious reflection on the left as to what might be done instead of military intervention.  What sort of independent investigation could be carried out to understand the causes of conflict and potential solutions?  What can be the role of diplomacy?  The prevailing images of immaculate rebels, dear to the left from its romanticizing of past conflicts, especially the Spanish Civil War, blocks reflection.  It blocks realistic assessment of the relationship of forces as well as the causes of armed rebellion in the world today, very different from the 1930s, favorite source of the cherished legends of the Western left.</p>
<p>What is also remarkable is that most of the anti-anti-war left shares a general condemnation of the revolutions of the past, because they led to Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot etc. But now that the revolutionaries are (Western backed) Islamists, we are supposed to believe that everything will turn out fine. What about “drawing the lesson from the past” that violent revolutions are not necessarily the best or the only way to achieve social change?</p>
<p>An alternative policy would take a 180° turn away from the one currently advocated by the anti-anti-war left. Instead of calling for more and more interventions, we should demand of our governments the strict respect for international law, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and cooperation instead of confrontation.  Non-interference means not only military non-intervention. It applies also to diplomatic and economic actions: no unilateral sanctions, no threats during negotiations, and equal treatment of all States. Instead of constantly “denouncing” the leaders of countries such as Russia, China, Iran, Cuba for violating human rights, something the anti-anti-war left loves to do, we should listen to what they have to say, dialogue with them, and help our fellow citizens understand the different ways of thinking in the world, including the criticisms that other countries can make of our way of doing things.  Cultivating such mutual understanding could in the long run be the best way to improve “human rights” everywhere.</p>
<p>This would not bring instant solutions to human rights abuses or political conflicts in countries such as Libya or Syria.  But what does?  The policy of interference increases tensions and militarization in the world. The countries that feel targeted by that policy, and they are numerous, defend themselves however they can. The demonization campaigns prevent peaceful relations between peoples, cultural exchanges between citizens and, indirectly, the flourishing of the very liberal ideas that the advocates of interference claim to be promoting.  Once the anti-anti-war left abandoned any alternative program, it in fact gave up the possibility of having the slightest influence over world affairs.  It does not in reality “help the victims” as it claims. Except for destroying all resistance here to imperialism and war, it does <em>nothing</em>.   The only ones who are really doing anything are in fact the succeeding U.S. administrations. Counting on them to care for the well-being of the world’s peoples is an attitude of total hopelessness. This hopelessness is an aspect of the way most of the Left reacted to the “fall of communism”, by embracing the policies that were the exact opposite of those of the communists, particularly in international affairs, where opposition to imperialism and the defense of national sovereignty have increasingly been demonized as “leftovers from Stalinism”.</p>
<p>Interventionism and European construction are both right-wing policies. One of them is linked to the American drive for world hegemony. The other is the framework supporting neoliberal economic policies and destruction of social protection. Paradoxically, both have been largely justified by “left-wing” ideas : human rights, internationalism, anti-racism and anti-nationalism.  In both cases, a left that lost its way after the fall of the Soviet bloc has grasped at salvation by clinging to a “generous, humanitarian” discourse, which totally lacks any realistic analysis of the relationship of forces in the world. With such a left, the right hardly needs any ideology of its own; it can make do with human rights.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, both those policies, interventionism and European construction, are today in a dead end. U.S. imperialism is faced with huge difficulties, both economic and diplomatic. Its intervention policy has managed to unite much of the world against the United States. Scarcely anyone believes any more in “another” Europe, a social Europe, and the real existing European Union (the only one possible) does not arouse much enthusiasm among working people. Of course, those failures currently benefit solely the right and the far right, only because most of the left has stopped defending peace, international law and national sovereignty, as the precondition of democracy.</p>

			<p>The possibility that the Russians may have been more heavily involved in the recent fighting in Aleppo than they have let on has been provided by a photo which has appeared in the Arab media that is claimed to show Russian special forces soldiers talking to a Syrian soldier on the grounds of the so-called ‘Aleppo artillery base’ shortly after its recapture by the Syrian army.</p>
<p>As  <a href="http://theduran.com/syrian-army-jihadi-corridor-eastern-aleppo-artillery-base/" target="_blank">discussed previously</a>, the recapture of what is (wrongly) called the ‘Aleppo artillery base’ by the Syrian army on 4th September 2016 has led to the closure of the narrow corridor Jihadi fighters punched through the government lines encircling the Jihadi held districts of western Aleppo on 5th August 2016.</p>
<p>The Russian special forces soldiers in the photo appear to be fully armed and in full combat gear, as if they had recently taken part in the fighting to recapture the ‘Aleppo military base’.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://45eq7vmb9bj1ratu11zv1p19.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/russian-special-forces-in-Aleppo-military-academy-2.jpeg" alt="russian special forces in Aleppo military academy 2" width="552" height="856" /></p>
<p>If Russian special forces were involved in the fighting to recapture the base, then that might explain the speed of its recapture after weeks of fighting.</p>
<p>The photo should not be taken as definite proof that Russian special forces were involved in the fighting in Aleppo.  It cannot be said definitely that the photo was taken inside the base; nor can it be said definitely when it was taken.</p>
<p>Even if the photo was taken inside the base after it was recaptured by the Syrian army, the Russian soldiers’ presence in the base does not prove that they were involved in the fighting that led to its recapture on 4th September 2016.</p>
<p>The Russians have consistently denied that their troops are involved in any ground fighting in Syria, and if their special forces troops were involved in the recapture of the ‘Aleppo artillery base’ then on the face of it that would contradict this.</p>
<p>However it has now become common international practice to treat special forces soldiers differently from other soldiers, so that denials of a country’s participation in ground fighting apparently does not extend to them.  A good example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/pictures-appear-to-show-british-special-forces-on-syrian-front-line" target="_blank">the recently confirmed presence of British special forces troops in Syria</a>, which has come after months of denials by the British government that British ground troops would be sent to Syria.</p>
<p>The Russian military did <a href="https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/russian-army-convoy-arrives-aleppo/" target="_blank">deploy a small number of Russian elite naval infantry</a> (supposedly and depending upon reports between 80 and 120 men) to Aleppo a few days ago, purportedly to participate in humanitarian operations there.  It could be that this deployment was used as cover for the deployment of the special forces troops who have now been photographed in the ‘Aleppo artillery base’, and who may have been involved in its recapture.</p>
<p>If Russian special forces were involved in the fighting that led to the recapture of the ‘Aleppo artillery base’ then this would almost certainly have been approved at the highest level at one of the various meetings of Russia’s Security Council which took place in August.  The strongest probability is <a href="http://theduran.com/fighting-raging-aleppo-erdogans-visit-putin-meets-security-chiefs/" target="_blank">the impromptu meeting which happened on 8th August 2016</a> – three days after the storming by the Jihadis of the ‘Aleppo artillery base’ – on the eve of Putin’s flight to Baku to meet with the leaders of Azerbaijan and Iran.  Whenever the decision was made Putin would of course have been personally involved.</p>
<p>Even if it eventually confirmed that Russian special forces troops were involved in the recapture of the ‘Aleppo artillery base’ a sense of proportion is needed.  Though these are highly trained elite troops, they are not supermen.  If they really did number 80-120 men as reports say, then they obviously could not have captured the whole large territory of the ‘Aleppo artillery base’ in the face of resistance by hundreds and possibly thousands of Jihadi fighters all by themselves.</p>
<p>They would have made up only a small proportion of the mainly Syrian troops who recaptured the base.  Whilst they might have been involved in some of the actual fighting, they are more likely to have exercised command, control and surveillance functions, assisting the Syrian troops who fought to recapture the base.</p>

			<p><em>The key figures reflecting the extent of the economic collapse that Greece has experienced since 2009 are pretty well known, even to those who have not been following the story that closely over the past few years.</em></p>
<p>The loss of a quarter of economic output and the increase in the unemployment rate close to 28 percent at one point have been widely and repeatedly reported as Greece has struggled through a state of perma-crisis in recent years.</p>
<p>As economic activity fell, jobs were lost, wages were severely cut, taxation kept increasing and disposable incomes were abruptly reduced. Large parts of Greek society felt like the ground under their feet had given way. Living standards were compromised to varying degrees and, as usual, the weakest in society were the most vulnerable to these abrupt changes. Many faced a daily battle to meet basic needs and keep their families afloat. Habits have also been affected by the economic calamity, which has impinged on Greek society in ways that often go unnoticed, unlike the headline numbers.</p>
<p>For instance, according to the <a href="http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/1590058/LivingConditionsInGreece_0716.pdf/0c5ea633-a8a5-427a-a6fc-82b206fecc9b" target="_blank">Living Conditions</a> publication of ELSTAT, Greeks seem to be much more reluctant to get married: weddings have dropped from a high of 61,377 in 2007 to 53,105 in 2014, when the most recent data is available. In the meantime, civil weddings have doubled from their 2003 level of 13,210 to 26,915 in 2014. The two contrasting trends suggest that financial considerations have played an important part in shaping them.</p>
<p>The last few years have also seen an increase in the number of divorces. The most recent data, from 2013, points to 16,717 divorces, compared to around 13,000 in the preceding years. Although the increase affected marriages of all durations, the most marked rise was in marriages of more than 10 years, where divorces increased from 8,334 in 2009 to 10,091. Obviously, there is a range of factors that can affect the sustainability of marriage, but there is a suggestion that the added financial and social pressures linked to the crisis have taken their toll on some unions.</p>
<p>Since the high of 118,302 births in 2008, there has been a significant drop during the crisis. By 2014 the figure had fallen to 92,148. In fact, Greece has had a negative birth rate since 2011. In the absence of migration, the population of Greece would have fallen by 21,592 in 2014.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.macropolis.gr/resources/toolip/img-thumb/2016/08/30/births_deaths_2-large.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Greece’s demographic footprint is steadily being reshaped as the crisis rumbles on.</p>
<p>Job and income insecurity have impacted family planning as long-term unemployment in 2015 was 875,259 – equally affecting men and women – and only marginally lower from the 2014 high of 936,832.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.macropolis.gr/resources/toolip/img-thumb/2016/08/30/long_term-unemployed-large.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Within the economically active age group of 18 to 60 year olds, 18 percent were living in jobless households in 2015. When children are included in this group, the figure reaches 1,280,745, which means that 12 percent of the entire Greek population does not have an income from employment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.macropolis.gr/resources/toolip/img-thumb/2016/08/30/jobless_households-large.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the same year, more than 1.1 million Greeks were living in low-work intensity homes, where working-age members worked less than 20 percent of their work potential and availability, with a knock-on effect on incomes. In 2009 that figure was much lower at 539,000.</p>
<p>These labour-market developments have pushed parts of Greek society below the poverty threshold, which in 2015 was 4,512 euros of annual income, down from 7,178 in 2010.</p>
<p>More than a third of Greeks (35.7 percent) are currently considered at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The absolute figure stood at 3.8 million in 2015, from about 3 million in the 2007–2009 period. In 2014, when there is comparable data, only Bulgaria and Romania had higher risk-of-poverty rates.</p>
<p>The risk-of-poverty rate is even higher when current income is compared to the poverty threshold set in 2005. When measured that way, the deterioration of living standards is startling as 42.2 percent of Greeks have dropped below the poverty threshold of 2005, from just 16.3 percent in 2010. That amounts to an almost threefold increase in just five years.</p>
<p>From 23 percent in 2009, almost four in ten Greeks are now facing material deprivation in terms of basic standards of respectable living. That is 44.5 percent for children, 41.5 percent for economically active adults and almost 35 percent for over-65 year olds.</p>
<p>The impact of the financial strain on Greek society is multifaceted and so far-reaching that it has been deemed to have directly linked to the quality of people’s health. In 2009 just 4.1 percent of the Greek population were unable to obtain medical examination and treatment. The obstacles in meeting these needs were economic, operational (waiting lists), logistical (not being close to a doctor or hospital) or psychological (fear of being treated) in nature. In 2015, over 14 percent of the Greek population could not obtain the required examination or treatment.</p>
<p>The gravity of the role that economic difficulties have played in the deterioration of health standards is demonstrated by the bottom two quintiles of income, which have seen the percentages of unmet health needs more than double to 19.7 percent for the quintile with the lowest income and treble to 18 percent for the next income quintile.</p>
<p>Naturally, spending habits have also changed as lower disposable income required the reallocation of financial resources in types of spending. Households average monthly expenditure, according to the annual <a href="http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/985039/Results+of+the+Household+Budget+Survey+%28HBS%29/338cb80b-6b5f-4d67-83d5-1f8fa77abf12?version=1.0" target="_blank">Budget Survey</a> published by ELSTAT, is falling continuously since 2009 and in 2014, the latest available year with data, it is 31% lower at 1,461 euros from the 2008 level.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.macropolis.gr/resources/toolip/img-thumb/2016/08/30/household_expenditure-large.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Food, a basic need, now represents more than 20 percent of monthly household expenditure from 17.3 percent in 2009. In spite of a higher budget allocation to food, Greeks dietary habits have taken a turn for the worse. Since 2009, the average monthly consumption of vegetables has fallen by 3.5 kilograms, of fruit by 2.5kg, of meat by 1.6kg and of milk roughly by around 1.3 litres.</p>
<p>Housing expenditure has increased by two percentage points to 13.4 percent. Clothing and footwear has dropped by two percentage points to 5.9 percent of expenditure, durable goods have also lost two percentage points in the household budget allocation, falling to 5 percent of the monthly spend. Hotels, cafes and restaurants dropped by a percentage point to below 10 percent.</p>
<p>The drop in spending across all categories has been precipitous since 2008, ranging from 13.7 percent on food to circa 51% sharp drop in expenditure on clothes and footwear category and on durables.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.macropolis.gr/resources/toolip/img-thumb/2016/08/30/household_expenditure_change-large.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Tighter budgets influence residents’ ability to engage in travel and recreation. In 2009, almost 4 million Greeks took a trip of four days of more. In 2013, this figure had fallen to 2.6 million and recovered only marginally to 3 million in 2015. Total personal trips came to over 7.7 million in 2009, but this figure plummeted to 4.3 million last year.</p>
<p>These statistics reflect developments that are life-altering, abrupt and involve deep changes in the standards and quality of life. They are so extensive that they are likely to leave permanent scars.</p>
<p>Economically active men and women might not expect to find themselves in full employment again as their skills erode after years out of work amid an expected slow recovery for the labour market.</p>
<p>Thousands of children that live in households that have no member in work (230,774 in the first quarter of 2016) will not have <a href="http://www.macropolis.gr/?i=portal.en.society.4363" target="_blank">decent opportunities to develop in physical, educational or professional terms</a>.</p>
<p>These devastating social developments have often been described as a humanitarian crisis, a term so overused by some that it became tired and seemed like a vast exaggeration in the context of the refugee crisis or the Syrian situation. However, war-torn countries and migration on an unprecedented scale should not be the benchmark here.</p>
<p>Greece is a country where statistical figures are thoroughly monitored. This hard data drives political decisions from its lenders. The economic and social deterioration that Greeks are living through is also captured in hard numbers. These statistics should not be neglected any longer.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 6th, 2016</strong> by Rick Sterling</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><em>At the recent annual convention of Veterans for Peace, VFP Vice President Jerry Condon said “The US peace movement has been demobilized by disinformation on Syria.” </em></p>
<p><em>Disinformation and propaganda on Syria takes three distinct forms. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The first is the demonization of the Syrian leadership. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The second is the romanticization of the opposition. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The third form involves attacking anyone</em> questioning the preceding characterizations.</p>
<p>There is a recent article which exemplifies all three of these forms. It is titled <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/08/26/anti-imperialism-and-the-syrian-revolution/">“Anti-Imperialism and the Syrian Revolution”</a> by Ashley Smith of the International Socialist Organization (ISO). It’s a remarkable piece of misinformation and faulty analysis.  Because it is clear and well written, it is likely to mislead people who are not well informed on the facts regarding Syria. Hence the importance of critically reviewing it.</p>
<p><strong>Technique 1: Demonize the enemy … “the Syrian regime and its brutal dictator” </strong></p>
<p>Smith starts off posing the question: Are you with the Syrian revolution or the brutal Assad dictatorship? The way he frames it, it’s not a difficult choice: yay for the revolution!</p>
<p>Like these false options, Ashley Smith’s article is a fairy tale devoid of reality.  His bias is shown as he criticizes the Left for ignoring “Assad’s massacre of some 400,000 Syrians”. Included in this death count are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War">100 &#8211; 150 thousand Syrian soldiers and allies</a>. Ashley blames Assad instead of the armed opposition for killing Syrian soldiers!</p>
<p>Another example of false propaganda is the discussion of the chemical weapons attack that took place on August 21, 2013 in outer Damascus.  Neoconservatives speak of this event as “proving” Assad’s brutality &#8211; “killing his own people” &#8211; as well as the “failure” of President Obama to enforce his “red line”.  Ashley aligns with the neocons as he says “Barack Obama came under pressure to intervene militarily in Syria after the regime carried out a chemical weapons attack in a suburb of Damascus in 2013, but he backed a Russian-brokered resolution that protected Assad.”</p>
<p>In reality, the Damascus sarin gas attack was carried out by an opposition group with the goal of forcing the U.S. to directly attack the Syrian government. Soon after the event, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity issued a <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2013/09/06/obama-warned-on-syrian-intel/">statement</a> reporting “<em>the most reliable intelligence shows that Bashar al-Assad was NOT responsible for the chemical incident”. </em>Later on, Seymour Hersh wrote two lengthy investigations pointing to <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line">Jabhat al Nusra with Turkish support</a> being culpable. Investigative journalist Robert Parry <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2014/04/07/the-collapsing-syria-sarin-case/">exposed</a> the Human Rights Watch analysis blaming the Syrian government as a “junk heap of bad evidence”. In the Turkish parliament, Turkish deputies presented documents showing that Turkey provided sarin to Syrian “rebels”.  A detailed examination and analysis of all fact based stories in online at <a href="http://whoghouta.blogspot.com/">whoghouta.blogspot.com</a>. Their conclusion is that “The only plausible scenario that fits the evidence is an attack by opposition forces.”</p>
<p>Ashley Smith accuses the Syrian government of widespread torture. His main example is the case of Syrian Canadian <a href="https://www.therenditionproject.org.uk/prisoners/arar.html">Maher Arar</a> who was arrested by US authorities in collusion with Canadian authorities, then rendered to Syria for interrogation in 2002. Arar was beaten during the initial weeks of his interrogation in Syria. After ten months imprisonment, Syrian authorities determined he was not a terrorist and sent him back to Canada. Arar received an official apology and $10 Million from the Canadian government.</p>
<p>The most highly publicized accusation of rampant torture and murder by Syrian authorities is the case of “Caesar”.  The individual known as “Caesar” was presented as a defecting Syrian photographer who had 55,000 photos documenting 11,000 Syrians tortured by the brutal Assad dictatorship. At the time, among mainstream media only the Christian Science Monitor was skeptical, describing it as “a well timed propaganda exercise”. In the past year it has been discovered that nearly half the photos show the opposite of what is claimed. The <a href="http://dissidentvoice.org/2016/03/the-caesar-photo-fraud-that-undermined-syrian-negotiations/">Caesar story</a> is essentially a fraud funded by Qatar with ‘for hire’ lawyers giving it a professional veneer and massive mainstream media promotion.</p>
<p>While western media routinely refers to Assad as a dictator, in fact he is elected and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/17/syrians-support-assad-western-propaganda">popular with the majority of Syrians. </a> Although not wealthy, Syria was largely self-sufficient with a semi-socialist state apparatus including free health-care, free education and large industries 51% owned by the state. You do not see pervasive western fast food, banks, and other corporate entities in Syrian cities.  In the wake of protests, the government pushed through reforms which ended the one party system. There are now political parties across the political spectrum. These are a genuine ‘moderate opposition’. The June 2014 election <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/06/04/syrian-election-shows-depth-popular-support-for-assad-even-among-sunni-majority/">confirmed</a> Assad’s popularity despite the denials of those who have never been there.</p>
<p><strong>Technique 2: Romanticize the opposition … “the Syrian Revolution” </strong></p>
<p>Ashley Smith echoes mainstream media which portrays the conflict as a “civil war” which began with peaceful democratic loving Syrian revolutionaries beaten by a brutal regime.</p>
<p>In reality there was a violent faction from the start. In the first protests in Deraa <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/143026#.Uzvi_PmSyXp">seven police were killed</a>. Two weeks later there was a <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-edge/157412-syria-hidden-massacre-2011/">massacre</a> of 60 security forces in Deraa.  In Homs, an <a href="http://thebricspost.com/an-eyewitness-to-the-syrian-rebellion-father-frans-in-his-own-words/#.V8mck6L0_1q">eye-witness</a> recounted the situation:  “<em>From the start, the protest movements were not purely peaceful. From the start I saw armed demonstrators marching along in the protests, who began to shoot at the police first. Very often the violence of the security forces has been a reaction to the brutal violence of the armed rebels.” </em>In the first two months, hundreds of police and security forces were killed.</p>
<p>Ashley and company listen to Americans and British citizens and mistakenly believe they are listening to real Syrians.  Some of these people left Syria at age 3. Some of them have never lived in Syria. Thus you have fantasy portrayals such as “Burning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War”. A more realistic picture is given by a Syrian who still lives in Aleppo. He writes under the name “Edward Dark” and describes how he and his friends quickly regretted the take-over of Aleppo by armed groups in summer 2012. He <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/syria-revolution-aleppo-assad.html">describes</a> one friend&#8217;s reaction as the reality was hitting home: <em>“How could we have been so stupid? We were betrayed!”. </em>And another says: <em>“Tell your children someday that we once had a beautiful country, but we destroyed it because of our ignorance and hatred.&#8221;</em> Edward Dark is a harsh critic of President Assad and Baath Party.  He is also naive regarding the role of US Ambassador Robert Ford.  But his description of early protesters and the arrival of armed opposition rings true and more authentic than the portrayal of Yassin-Kassab and Al Shami.</p>
<p>In fact many of the idealized “Syrian revolutionaries” promoted by the authors of “Burning Country” are trained and paid agents of the US and UK. The <a href="http://www.syrian-expatriates.org/our-work/development-support/aleppo-media-centre/">Aleppo Media Center</a> which produces many of the videos is a US creation.  The <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/06/21/who-are-the-syria-white-helmets/">White Helmets </a>which purport to be Syrian, independent and unarmed first responders are a creation of the US and UK. The <a href="https://yallalabarra.wordpress.com/2015/10/05/kafranbel-media-center-a-propaganda-banner-assembly-line-that-targets-the-naive-2/">banner boys from Kafranbel</a> are another western funded operation. In her book about her time as Secretary of State, Clinton boasts of providing “training for more than a thousand activists, students, and independent journalists” (p. 464).</p>
<p>Why do the enemies of Syria create such organizations?  Partly as a way to channel money and support to the armed opposition. Also to serve as propaganda tools to confuse the situation and generate support for the real goal: regime change. For example, White Helmets mostly work in areas dominated by the Syrian Al Qaeda.  Unlike legitimate organizations such as the Red Crescent, they never work in areas controlled by the government. And they are also active on the propaganda front, continually pushing for US / NATO intervention via a  “no fly zone”. The misinformation of Ashley Smith and ISO confuses unwitting people and helps the enemies of Syria in their drive for regime change.</p>
<p>In contrast with the romanticized delusions of Ashley Smith and the authors of “Burning Country”, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency gave an <a href="https://levantreport.com/2015/05/19/2012-defense-intelligence-agency-document-west-will-facilitate-rise-of-islamic-state-in-order-to-isolate-the-syrian-regime/">accurate assessment</a> in August 2012:</p>
<p>“ EVENTS ARE TAKING A CLEAR SECTARIAN DIRECTION.  THE SALAFIST, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND AQI ARE THE MAJOR FORCES DRIVING THE INSURGENCY IN SYRIA.”</p>
<p><strong>Technique 3: Attack Those who Question the Dogma … “You’re an Assad supporter!” </strong></p>
<p>Ashley Smith does not criticize the NATO and Gulf states that are violating international law and the UN charter by funding and supplying a proxy army to attack Syria.  Instead, he criticizes left groups who oppose the aggression. That is a sign of how far off track ISO is. They did the <a href="https://socialistworker.org/2011/02/28/taking-sides-about-libya">same thing</a> regarding Libya and have evidently learned nothing from that disaster. Ashley Smith should go and tour Libya now to savor the “revolution” he promoted.</p>
<p>Ashley Smith’s theme with respect to Syria (peaceful popular uprising against brutal dictator) is the same theme promoted by neoconservatives and the mainstream media.  When they encounter a different perspective,  they cry out, “You are an Assad supporter!”. Never mind that many genuine progressives do not say that. What we say is that it’s for the Syrian people to determine their government, not foreigners.</p>
<p>Smith criticizes the British Stop the War coalition for having “adapted to Assad supporters” and for “giving a platform to allies of the dictatorship”, specifically “regime apologist Mother Superior Agnes Mariam”. Smith is misinformed on this issue also, but it is doubly revealing. In fact, Mother Agnes was hosted on the tour by Syria Solidarity Movement.  When she was in London, she was invited to speak at a Stop the War rally. To his great discredit, the keynote speaker Jeremy Scahill, who is closely aligned with ISO, threatened to withdraw from the conference if Mother Agnes spoke.  Scahill has done great journalistic work exposing Blackwater and Drone Warfare.  However that does not excuse the <a href="http://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2013-11-18/bowing-before-the-inquisitors-on-syria/">complicity</a> leading to <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-edge/mother-agnes-liberal-interventionists-026/">blackmail</a> regarding a Palestinian Lebanese nun who has shown immense courage in <a href="http://www.syriasolidaritymovement.org/2013/11/07/1881/">promoting reconciliation </a>and peace in Syria. However, that action is typical of some misguided “socialist” groups, the Muslim Brotherhood and their allies. Mother Agnes was verbally attacked and abused by these groups throughout her tour, which otherwise met with great success. Mother Agnes has lived in Syria for over twenty years.  She consistently says that Syria needs reform, but you don’t do that by destroying it.</p>
<p>Ashley Smith goes on to criticize the US Peace Council for recently sending a delegation to Syria and having the audacity to talk with “Assad and his henchmen”. He sounds like the right wing hawks who denounced Jane Fonda for going to North Vietnam in the 1970’s. Smith displays a dogmatic and closed-minded view; what kind of “international socialism” does he represent?</p>
<p>Smith criticizes Green Party candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka for “remaining silent about Putin’s and Assad’s atrocities”. This is another measure of how far off track the ISO is.  They evidently are not aware of international law or they don’t care about it. The Assad government has a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks which are sponsored, funded and supplied by foreign governments.</p>
<p>Syria also has a right to request help from Russia and Iran. But with tunnel-vision dogma, Ashley Smith and ISO do not care. They seem to be supporting instead of opposing imperialist aggression, violations of international law, and the death and destruction these have led to.</p>
<p>Ashley disparages the Syrian government and people who have continued to fight against the forces of sectarianism promoted by NATO, Israel and the Gulf monarchies. Ashley and ISO would do well to send some people to see the reality of Syria. They would find it very different than their fevered imagination or what they have been led to believe by fake Syrians and Muslim Brotherhood dogmatists.</p>
<p>Genuine progressives are not “Assad supporters”. Rather, we are opponents of imperialist aggression and supporters of international law&#8211;which says it’s the right of Syrians to determine who leads them. That would mean real Syrians, not those raised in or paid by the West.</p>
<div>
<p><em><strong>Ashley Smith’s Inaccurate Overall Analysis </strong></em></p>
<p>Ashley Smith gives a very inaccurate analysis of the overall geopolitical situation in Syria and beyond.</p>
<p>He says “The US has been seeking a resolution that might push Assad aside, but that above all maintains his regime in power”. He goes on to say ‘U.S. policy from the beginning has been to preserve the core of Assad’s state.” Ashley believes “the U.S. has retreated in general from outright regime change as its strategy in the Middle East”.</p>
<p>This is absurd. In reality the US and allies Israel and Saudi Arabia have been pushing for ‘regime change’ in Syria for over a decade. In 2005 CNN host Christiane Amanpour expressed the situation bluntly:</p>
<p><em>“Mr. President, you know the rhetoric of regime change is headed towards you from the United States. They are actively looking for a new Syrian leader. They&#8217;re granting visas and visits to Syrian opposition politicians. They&#8217;re talking about isolating you diplomatically and, perhaps, a coup d&#8217;etat or your regime crumbling. What are you thinking about that?”</em></p>
<p>In 2007, Seymour Hersh wrote about the destabilization efforts in his article <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/03/05/the-redirection">“The Redirection”</a>.<em></em></p>
<p>In 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke of “changing Syria’s behavior” and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/30/hillary-clinton-israel-commitment"> threatened</a> <em>&#8220;President Assad is making decisions that could mean war or peace for the region …. We know he&#8217;s hearing from Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. It is crucial that he also hear directly from us, so that the potential consequences of his actions are clear.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Secretary Clinton appointed Robert Ford to become US Ambassador to Syria. Ford was previously the chief political officer in Baghdad for Ambassador John Negroponte.  Who is John Negroponte? He was Ambassador to Honduras overseeing the Nicaraguan Contras and El Salvador death squads in the 1980’s. Negroponte’s arrival in Iraq in 2004 led to ‘<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/pentagon-may-put-special-forces-led-assassination-or-kidnapping-teams-iraq-117209">the El Salvador option</a>’ (sectarian death squads)  in Iraq.</p>
<p>Since the conflict in Syria began in 2011 the US has spent many billions of dollars trying to overthrow the Syrian government or force it to change policy. The supply of sophisticated and deadly weaponry continues.  In April 2016 it was <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/59374/us-arms-shipment-to-syrian-rebels-detailed">reported</a> that the US recently supplied 994 TONS of sophisticated rocket launchers, anti tank and other heavy weapons to “moderate rebels” who ally with the Syrian Al Qaeda ( Jabhat al Nusra recently renamed Jabhat Fatah al Sham).</p>
<p>Ashley’s theory that the US is intent on “preserving” the Syrian state and the US has “given up” on regime change is not supported by the facts.</p>
<p>Ashley continues the faulty analysis by saying “the U.S. is solely and obsessively focused on defeating this counterrevolutionary force (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria” and “the Obama administration has struck a de facto alliance with Russia”.</p>
<p>This is more theory without evidence. The US coalition was doing little to stop ISIS and looked the other way as ISIS went across the open desert to attack and occupy Palmyra.  They were similarly looking the other way as ISIS sent hundreds of trucks filled with oil from eastern Syria into Turkey each day.  It was not until Russia entered the scene in support of Syria one year ago, that the US coalition got embarrassed into actually attacking ISIS.  As to a “de facto alliance”, this is what Russia has implored the US to do, largely without response.  In the past two weeks the U.S. has threatened Russian and Syrian planes not to attack US ground forces inside Syria and refused to come to agreement with Russia that “moderate rebels” working with acknowledged terrorists are not “moderate” and can be targeted.</p>
<p>The Obama administration is trying to prevent the collapse of the regime change project by stalling and delay. Perhaps they wish to keep the project alive for a more aggressive US policy. Hillary Clinton continues to talk about a “no fly zone”. Her allies in Congress have recently initiated HR5732 which will escalate economic and financial sanctions against Syria and assess the implementation of a “no fly zone”.</p>
<p>Ashley Smith suggests that large portions of the US left have been avidly supporting “oppressive regimes” such as Syria and Iran.  He mocks those on the left who suggested the Iranian ‘green movement’ was US-influenced. His mockery is exposed as ignorance by none other than Hillary Clinton herself.  In her book “Hard Choices” she recounts how they arranged for Twitter to postpone a system upgrade which would have taken the social media giant offline at a critical time, right after the 2009 Iranian election. Hillary and her group at the State Dept were actively promoting the protests in Iran.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Times Ahead </strong></p>
<p>Some middle east analysts have made the faulty analysis that Israel is not involved in the aggression against Syria. In reality, Israeli interests are at the core of the US policy against Syria. The Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. was explicit: <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Syria-Crisis/Oren-Jerusalem-has-wanted-Assad-ousted-since-the-outbreak-of-the-Syrian-civil-war-326328">“Israel wanted Assad gone since start of civil war”</a>. He also said “bad guys supported by Iran” are worse than “bad guys not supported by Iran”.  In other words, Israel prefers chaos and Al Qaeda to a stable independent Syria.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is the other key U.S. ally seeking overthrow in Syria.  With its close connections to the oil industry, military industrial complex and Wall Street, Saudi Arabia has enormous influence in Washington. It has been mercilessly bombing Yemen for the last 18 months and continues funding and promoting the proxy war against Syria.</p>
<p>Both Saudi Arabia and Israel seek the same thing: breaking the resistance alliance which runs from Iran through Syria to Lebanon.  They are in alliance with US neoconservatives who still dream of “a new American Century” where the US fights multiple wars to enforce its exceptional and sole supremacy. Along with some other countries, these are the forces of reaction violating international law and promoting the war against Syria.</p>
<p>The tide is turning against the forces pushing for ‘regime change’ in Syria. But they have not yet given up and may even escalate.  Now is when progressives in the West need to raise our voices in opposition to this aggression. Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka can hopefully bring much more attention to this critical issue. Bernie Sanders and his supporters need to speak out against Hillary Clinton’s statements and plans.</p>
<p>There are good people in ISO which does good work in many areas. We hope they will re-examine their assumptions, beliefs and actions regarding Syria. In the dangerous times ahead, we need them to be resisting the drive to war in Syria, not condoning or supporting it.</p>

<p><em>Parents concerned about their vaccinated children potentially contracting measles from unvaccinated children may want to consider the fact that the bigger health threat is technically the vaccine, not the disease itself. Comparative data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveal that <strong>nobody</strong> has died from measles in more than 10 years, while at least 108 deaths reported in VAERS during the same time frame have been linked to measles vaccines.</em></p>
<p>Many of our older readers probably remember a time when measles wasn&#8217;t viewed with the obscene level of paranoid hysterics being witnessed today. Like chickenpox, measles was a common childhood infection that, after running its typically mild course, imparted lifelong immunity in those who contracted it. The risk of serious complications or death from measles has always been overwhelmingly minimal, in other words, with previous generations viewing it as something of a rite of passage.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and all rationality and common sense has gone out the window on this issue. The media is reporting a few isolated cases of measles as if it were the black plague, calling for those who don&#8217;t vaccinate their children to be ostracized from their communities or even jailed for &#8220;putting others at unnecessary risk.&#8221; But where are the facts in all this unsubstantiated mania, which unfairly tags the unvaccinated as dangerous lepers?</p>
<p>Once again, the media is discarding factual reporting in favor of mindless sensationalism, attributing an alleged <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/measles.html">measles</a> resurgence &#8212; even this claim is specious &#8212; to the unvaccinated. Whether or not this claim is actually true pales in importance compared to the fact that measles really isn&#8217;t much of a threat in the first place. The measles <em><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/vaccine.html">vaccine</a></em>, on the other hand, is a whole different story.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003,&#8221; the Associate Press reported based off statements made by Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC&#8217;s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, VAERS, which captures only a very small percentage of the actual number of injuries and deaths associated with measles <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/vaccines.html">vaccines</a>, reports at least 108 <em>deaths</em> associated with measles vaccines since 2003. Of these, a shocking 96 deaths were reported in conjunction with MMR, which is now the preferred vaccine for measles immunization.</p>
<p><strong>Measles deaths were virtually nonexistent prior to introduction of vaccine, which is now triggering outbreaks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some will try to argue that measles deaths are essentially nonexistent now <em>because</em> of measles vaccines, the first of which was introduced in 1963. But this argument holds no water &#8212; U.S. measles mortality data shows that deaths from measles rapidly declined in the years leading up to when the first vaccine was introduced, validating the success of improved sanitation and better nutrition in making measles a non-problem.</p>
<p>This plotted graph from <em>HealthSentinel.com</em> visually illustrates this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/us-measles.jpg" rel="lightbox[5429736]" title="us-measles"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5429737" title="us-measles" src="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/us-measles.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="432" /></a><br />
&#8220;What you may not have heard, is that by 1963, the death rate from measles in the United States had already dropped by approximately 98%,&#8221; explains the International Medical Council on Vaccination (IMCV).</p>
<p>Not long after it was introduced, the first measles vaccine was actually found to manifest <em>worse</em> symptoms of measles in vaccinated patients than if they hadn&#8217;t gotten the vaccine at all. The vaccine also suppressed the normal rash and fever associated with measles, obstructing the normal immune response and ultimately leading to future health problems for vaccinated individuals once they reached adulthood.</p>
<p>&#8220;[W]hereas natural measles exposure generally left the person with reliable lifelong immunity, measles vaccines leave the individual with waning immunity,&#8221; adds IMCV. &#8220;This dynamic of waning immunity means we will probably see measles epidemics even in highly vaccinated populations.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><em>On August 15, 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) invited &#8220;<a href="http://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&amp;po=0&amp;dct=PS&amp;D=CDC-2016-0068&amp;refD=CDC-2016-0068-0001">public comment</a>&#8221; on an especially disturbing edict that will allow the federal agency alongside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to quarantine entire geographic areas of the United States, restrict the movement and behavior of inhabitants in these areas, and ultimately require they undergo vaccination&#8211;in a voluntary manner of course&#8211;or face criminal prosecution. </em></p>
<p><em>In fact, municipalities need only be given a vague &#8220;precommunicable&#8221; designation to undergo an overall loss of civil liberties that can include mandatory vaccination. </em></p>
<p>This action is being unilaterally undertaken by a bureaucracy that in recent months has proceeded in a thoroughly irresponsible manner to hype the alleged dangers of the Zika virus, even promoting the aerial dispersion of a toxic substance on South Florida populations to control Zika without any scientific evidence such a measure is safe or effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Accompanying this, in July the Obama administration sought $1.9 billion from Congress to &#8220;fight&#8221; the Zika virus. When it failed to secure such lavish funding Obama&#8217;s HHS funneled $81 million for Zika &#8220;research.&#8221; To be sure, Zika&#8217;s vague and difficult-to-diagnose symptoms make it an especially apt vehicle for creating widespread hysteria that could without much difficulty provide the basis for at least limited implementation of the CDC&#8217;s quarantine and vaccination project. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The CDC&#8217;s summary of its program reads as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">Through this <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CDC-2016-0068-0001">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> (NPRM), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is amending its domestic (interstate) and foreign quarantine regulations to best protect the public health of the United States. These amendments are being proposed to aid public health responses to outbreaks of communicable diseases such as the largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in history, the recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, and repeated outbreaks and responses to measles in the United States, as well as the ongoing threat of other new or re-emerging communicable diseases. The provisions contained herein provide additional clarity to various safeguards to prevent the importation and spread of communicable diseases affecting human health into the United States and interstate.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The document&#8217;s introductory passages point to the</span> <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Health_Service_Act">Public Health Service Act </a><span style="color: #000000;">and Executive Orders by Presidents Bush and Obama, alongside recent encounters with Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), as the basis of its action.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">HHS/CDC has statutory authority (42 U.S.C. 264, 265) to promulgate regulations which protect U.S. public health from communicable diseases, including quarantinable communicable diseases as specified in Executive Order of the President. See</span> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/sars/quarantine/exec-2004-04-03.html">Executive Order 13295</a> <span style="color: #000000;">(April 4, 2003), as amended by</span> <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13375">Executive Order 13375</a> <span style="color: #000000;">(April 1, 2005) and</span> <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-08-06/pdf/2014-18682.pdf">Executive Order 13674</a> <span style="color: #000000;">(July 31, 2014). The need for this proposed rulemaking was reinforced during HHS/CDC&#8217;s response to the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) on record, followed by the recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, both quarantinable communicable diseases, and repeated outbreaks and responses to measles, a non-quarantinable communicable disease of public health concern, in the United States.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">While measles is regarded as a &#8220;non-quarantinable communicable disease&#8221;, it is referenced a total 186 times through the NPRM, and repeatedly alongside Ebola and MERS, which are invoked 330 times and 60 times respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, the document emphasizes that &#8220;every case of measles in the United States is considered a public health emergency because of its extremely high transmissibility,&#8221; pointing to vaccination as an essential prophylactic.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_34463" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 910px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34463" src="https://memorygapdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/measles-cali.jpg" alt="measles cali" width="900" height="580" /><p class="wp-caption-text">An outbreak of measles beginning in California in 2015 resulted in severe government and media consternation over what was once regarded as an uncomfortable yet normal chapter of childhood.</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The passage continues to highlight federal authorities&#8217; &#8220;labor intensive&#8221; efforts to screen over 4,500 parties for a disease that has resulted in</span> <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/woman-dies-measles-first-us-death-12-years-n385946">only one US fatality since 2003</a><span style="color: #000000;">&#8211;a woman in her late twenties whose cause of death was directly attributed to a</span> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3148872/Woman-died-measles-vaccinated-patient-die-disease-U-S-12-years-succumbed-disease-health-problems.html">weakened immune system</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">As a result of high vaccination coverage, measles was declared eliminated (defined as interruption of year-round endemic transmission) from the United States in 2000; however, importations from other countries where measles remains endemic continue to occur, which can lead to clusters of measles cases in the United States in pockets of unvaccinated persons. Of note, an unprecedented outbreak that originated in late December 2014 in Orange County, California resulted in 125 cases; measles cases associated with this outbreak were reported in eight U.S. states, Mexico, and Canada. Between 2010 and 2014, HHS/CDC investigated 91 measles exposures on international or interstate flights, which required time-consuming and labor-intensive location and evaluation of more than 4700 individuals, resulting in the identification of 12 cases of onward transmission. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Global public health authorities have clearly indicated, and evidence has shown, that Ebola, MERS, and measles could spread between countries, and a re-emergence after the current outbreaks are controlled is always a risk. Additionally, although public health responses to measles have become routine over the past decade, the recent unprecedented outbreak in a large U.S. tourist destination with high potential for onward travel by exposed individuals identified greater danger for measles becoming reestablished in the United States in communities with lower rates of immunization. </span></p></blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">The Zika Trigger</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Since the CDC repeatedly employs the non-fatal and indeed once commonplace measles virus throughout the document in such a way there is nothing preventing the agency and its partners from plugging in one or more other maladies that are largely the product of government and corporate media hype and disinformation. A case in point is the Zika virus, a phenomenon that has received a deluge of media coverage for a comparatively scant number of cases identified in South Florida.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_34444" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 177px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34444 alignright" src="https://memorygapdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dr_frieden.jpg" alt="dr_frieden" width="167" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">CDC Director Tom Frieden. Image Credit: CDC</p></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The CDC has clumsily mandated spraying the insecticide Naled to control mosquitoes that can carry Zika, citing dubious research to back its directive. CDC Director Tom Frieden has thus far only cited one source upholding the efficacy of airborne insecticide dispersal to eliminate adult mosquitoes: &#8220;Unpublished research by a rookie mosquito control specialist,&#8221; the <em>Miami Herald</em> <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article98150357.html">reports</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">In a recent article for the influential medical journal JAMA, Frieden wrote that in New Orleans, planes spraying ultra-low volumes of insecticide reduced caged Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in open and sheltered areas by more than 90 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">His source for that data: a non-peer-reviewed presentation by a specialist named Brendan Carter at the New Orleans mosquito control board. Some of the presentation’s research was conducted while Carter was still an intern there in 2014, according to his LinkedIn page.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The board hired him that September after his internship. Carter earned his master’s degree in 2014 from the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, his LinkedIn page shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Even so, other experts in mosquito-borne diseases were unconvinced when asked about Carter’s finding as described in Frieden’s commentary for JAMA.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“I know of no published reports that support this figure,” said Durland Fish, a Yale University professor emeritus of microbial diseases as well as a professor of forestry and environmental studies there. Fish worked with public officials in Dominica in 2014 to counter chikungunya virus, another disease spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">“This is a domestic mosquito, meaning they live inside the house — in closets, under the bed, in the sink. Spraying outside won’t be very effective,” he said.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A CDC spokeswoman said the agency carefully reviewed the New Orleans data and was “confident it was a good indicator of efficacy.” Frieden cited it in JAMA because “there is limited published peer-reviewed data on efficacy of ultra-low volume aerial spraying of naled against Aedes aegypti,” according to the agency. [Emphasis added.]</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is what passes for science at the CDC&#8211;the mass aerial spraying of a toxic substance on specific populations with almost no evidence of its effectiveness to eradicate a non-fatal virus&#8211;one that has been known to exist for decades and whose patent is actually</span> <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/who-owns-the-zika-virus/5505323">owned by the Rockefeller Foundation</a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The takeaway from the above is that in the upside-down reality created by the government-corporate media nexus Zika&#8217;s symptoms can resemble the effects of the CDC&#8217;s method to counteract the virus&#8217; spread. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/symptoms/symptoms.html">According to the CDC</a>,<span style="color: #000000;"> Zika virus symptoms are &#8220;usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week.&#8221; In fact, &#8220;[m]any people infected with Zika virus won&#8217;t have symptoms, or will only have mild symptoms.&#8221; The most typical symptoms include</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fever</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Rash</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Joint pain</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Conjunctivitis (red eyes)<br />
</span><span style="color: #000000;">Muscle pain</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Headache</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The health impacts of naled are far worse and include reproductive harm that could be confused with microcephaly and other fetal abnormalities since the compound can cross the placenta and wreak havoc on the unborn. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, as Jon Rappoport has <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/category/zika/">exhaustively documented</a>, in Brazil the increased incidence of microcephaly (babies born with small heads and brain damage) is likely being <a href="http://www.gmwatch.org/news/latest-news/16706-argentine-and-brazilian-doctors-name-larvicide-as-potential-cause-of-microcephaly">caused by the larvicide Pyriproxyfen</a>, placed in drinking water supplies to control mosquitos. Thus the &#8220;Zika threat,&#8221; Rappoport posits, is a cover story designed to protect the pesticide manufacturers and associated actors, including the Brazilian Ministry of Health. </span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34457 aligncenter" src="https://memorygapdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/naled.jpg" alt="naled" width="480" height="248" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Below is an overview of naled&#8217;s effects on animal and human physiology from the </span> <a href="http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/metiram-propoxur/naled-ext.html">Extension Toxicology Network</a>, <span style="color: #000000;">a collaboration between Cornell University, Michigan State University, Oregon State University and the University of California Davis. </span></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS</span></h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">ACUTE TOXICITY</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naled is moderately to highly toxic by ingestion, inhalation and dermal adsorption. <strong>Vapors or fumes of naled are corrosive to the mucous membranes lining the mouth, throat and lungs, and inhalation may cause severe irritation</strong>. A sensation of tightness in the chest and coughing are commonly experienced after inhalation. As with all organophosphates, naled is readily absorbed through the skin. Skin which has come in contact with this material should be washed immediately with soap and water and all contaminated clothing should be removed. Persons with respiratory ailments, recent exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors, impaired cholinesterase production, or with liver malfunction may be at increased risk from exposure to naled. High environmental temperatures or exposure of naled to visible or UV light may enhance its toxicity.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">The organophosphate insecticides are <strong>cholinesterase inhibitors</strong>. They are <strong>highly toxic by all routes of exposure</strong>. When inhaled, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include <strong>bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath, and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes</strong>. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. <strong>Eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction, and blurred vision</strong>. Following exposure by any route, other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to 12 hours. These may include <strong>pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the eye pupils, tears, salivation, sweating, and confusion</strong>. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system, producing <strong>incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue, involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles</strong>. In severe cases there may also be <strong>involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beats, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma. Death may be caused by respiratory failure or cardiac arrest</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some organophosphates may cause delayed symptoms beginning 1 to 4 weeks after an acute exposure which may or may not have produced more immediate symptoms. In such cases, <strong>numbness, tingling, weakness and cramping</strong> may appear in the lower limbs and progress to incoordination and paralysis. Improvement may occur over months or years, but some residual impairment may remain in some cases.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Naled may cause dermatitis <strong>(skin rashes) and skin sensitization (allergies)</strong>. It is <strong>corrosive to the skin and eyes and may cause permanent damage</strong>. An aerial applicator developed contact dermatitis after using Dibrom. The exposed area became red and felt burned. Later, water filled blisters formed. They became itchy and dry, then flaked off.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The amount of a chemical that is lethal to one-half (50%) of experimental animals fed the material is referred to as its acute oral lethal dose fifty, or LD50. The oral LD50 for naled in rats is 50 to 281 mg/kg, in mice is 330 to 375 mg/kg, and in chickens is 281 mg/kg. Rats have tolerated a dosage of 28 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks with no visible signs of poisoning and with only moderate inhibition of cholinesterase. The dermal LD50 for naled in rabbits is 1,100 mg/kg, and in rats is 800 mg/kg.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The lethal concentration fifty, or LC50, is that concentration of a chemical in air or water that kills half of the experimental animals exposed to it for a set time period. The inhalation LC50 for naled in rats is 7.7 mg/kg, and 156 mg/kg in mice.</span></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">CHRONIC TOXICITY</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Repeated or prolonged exposure to organophosphates may result in the same effects as acute exposure including the delayed symptoms. Other effects reported in workers repeatedly exposed include <strong>impaired memory and concentration, disorientation, severe depressions, irritability, confusion, headache, speech difficulties, delayed reaction times, nightmares, sleepwalking and drowsiness or insomnia</strong>. An <strong>influenza-like condition with headache, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, and malaise</strong> has also been reported.<br />
</span><br />
<strong><span style="color: #000000;">Reproductive Effects</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Once in the bloodstream, naled may cross the placenta</strong>. [Emphases added.]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At present development of a Zika vaccine has</span> <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/zika-virus-outbreak/striking-results-early-zika-vaccine-trial-n623016">moved to human trials</a><span style="color: #000000;">. As noted, on August 10 the Obama administration&#8217;s HHS sought to bring such a vaccine to fruition by funneling $81 million toward vaccine research, Reuters</span> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-vaccines-idUSKCN10M20K">reports</a><span style="color: #000000;">. Less than one week later the CDC set in motion its</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Control of Communicable Diseases policy by inviting public comment. Keeping in mind the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s formidable ability to manipulate laws and regulation to its benefit, there is a strong possibility that these policies, cover stories, and commodities are being developed and rolled out in tandem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At this point the concerned citizen has more than enough to question what&#8217;s really afoot here. A population so propagandized and ill-informed on the negligible threat posed by Zika could easily mistake Naled&#8217;s effects for the mild symptoms characterizing the virus&#8211;much as Pyriproxyfen proved cause for a similar frenzy among public health officials in Brazil. This would provide the basis for an ambitious and wide scale federal effort to quarantine one or more areas and introduce related emergency measures now being dictated by the CDC. </span></p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 6th, 2016</strong> by Dr. Binoy Kampmark</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p><em>For years, Apple has perfected the art of tax minimisation, hoovering up possibilities in creating an empire built on profit and return. It has cultivated a power that adapts the message of the bribing agent with that of the bully, tempting government hosts with promises of plenty, and withdrawing pledges on being pushed into moves it would rather not make for the sake of customers and shareholders.  Permit tax breaks, and low tax bills, and your State prospers.</em></p>
<p><em>The European Commission, which occasionally comes across as a pushy regulatory bugbear, decided to make Apple accountable as a decent tax paying corporate citizen.  Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager did to Apple what she had done to the Netherlands and Luxembourg in 2014 when she ordered the recovery of back tax revenue from Starbucks (20-30 million euros) and Fiat Chrysler (20-30 million euros) respectively.<a title="" name="m_-6794894249920577647__ftnref1" rel="nofollow"></a>[1]</em></p>
<p>Apple was ordered to pay tax arrears totalling $14.5 billion into Irish treasury coffers, a decision that sent a hyper chill through the European corporate sector.  Capital’s power remains moveability, and corporate capital, when spooked, finds other sources. That is their magic wand, but on this score, the EU was refusing any bewitching on Apple’s part.</p>
<p>Apple’s response went by the book.  The first was a promise that it would seek to overturn the ruling, suggesting it was not only flawed but a case of “total political crap,” to use the words of CEO Tim Cook.<a title="" name="m_-6794894249920577647__ftnref2" rel="nofollow"></a>[2]</p>
<p>Apple General Counsel Bruce Sewell rejected the EU Commission’s claim that Apple’s Ireland base has paid a mere 0.005 percent of taxes to the country in 2014.  “We paid tax at the statutory rate of 12.5 percent tax on profits relating to our activities in Ireland.”</p>
<p>Sewell’s rebuttal list seemed impressive, but hardly addressed the more direct nature of the company’s operations.  The company, he insisted, has provided $400 million in corporate income tax in Ireland in the 2014 year, while also providing a further $400 million in current US corporate taxes on profits.  Several billion dollars in US corporate tax has also been accrued “on a deferred basis.”</p>
<p>A closer examination of the Irish operation gets shadier with greater digging, revealing an empire of tactical spread and heft.  For one, Cook’s explanation was that the activities were in line with that of a non-resident company, as permitted by Irish law.</p>
<p>The actual activities on research and development, including intellectual property came out of the Californian base in Cupertino, with the Irish office tasked with management.  But Apple did not, as Cook further explained, have an “office or employees in Ireland because it was not an operational business and its business was not specific to Ireland.”</p>
<p>A “small resident company” in Ireland could hardly be expected to cover value created in other bases (say, back in Cupertino).  A perfect ruse, in other words.  Thus, we have a view into the world of global non-taxation, with Cook carefully avoiding the obvious point that US companies such as Apple prefer to hold cash overseas to avoid paying the US tax rate of 35 percent on profit.</p>
<p>When confronted by the <em>Frankurter Allgemeinze Zeitung</em> about the obvious point that Apple’s subsidiary Irish operations were run purely to avoid paying taxes, Cook issued an emphatic denial.    The Irish operation, which commenced in 1980, had nothing to do with tax minimisation, or even avoidance, but everything about expansion and seeking “an extremely talented and well-trained workforce.”</p>
<p>The Irish cabinet, happy with that olive branch, has agreed, and wants nothing of the arrears.  The picture of a sovereign state nuzzling with a super company is never a pretty one, a matter normally concealed and obscured. Not in this case, where both entities intend dancing arm and arm in appeal against the ruling.</p>
<p>Taoiseach Enda Kenny decided to turn the sovereignty argument on its head: if Ireland wanted to make domestic policies favourable to companies, it was up to the Republic, rather than bureaucrats in Brussels.  Odd sort of sovereignty, to be so hostile to the collection of tax while favouring the enormous scope of action on the part of a multinational. “This is about Ireland, it is about our people, it’s about us as a sovereign nation, actually setting out what we consider our appropriate policies.”<a title="" name="m_-6794894249920577647__ftnref3" rel="nofollow"></a>[3]</p>
<p>Finance Minister Michael Noonan swirled with suggestions of offensive strategy on the part of Brussels. “I do think they are establishing a bridgehead.”   A “proxy attack” had been mounted on the 12.5 percent corporate tax rate in small Ireland, using Apple as the wicked irresponsible multinational colluding with Dublin.  “Envy,” claimed Noonan, was driving the grubby campaign, one indicated by periodic efforts on the part of European leaders to make Ireland lift the corporate rate.</p>
<p>Not all Irish political figures favour the view that inviting back taxes should not be accepted.  Their endorsement of an appeal about the decision is based as much on clarity as anything else.  Who holds the strings on the issue of multinationals in Europe when it comes to tax?  Children’s Minister Katharine Zappone, for instance, felt that the Commission’s decision had been “in the public interest.”</p>
<p>What the episode starkly reveals is a global system of regulation that some governments, and regimes, simply refuse to accept. The continuing illusion is that having the grand Apple in one’s backyard is a boon to jobs and a catalyst for other multinationals to join the tax free (or lower tax) playground.</p>

			<p><em>Sundus Saleh, an Iraqi woman, first filed her lawsuit against George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz in September 2013. Alleging that the Iraq War constituted an illegal crime of aggression, Saleh filed the suit on behalf of herself and other Iraqis in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.</em></p>
<p>The district court dismissed Saleh&#8217;s lawsuit in December 2014, saying the defendants acted within the scope of their employment when they planned and carried out the Iraq War. Saleh then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>
<p>In her appeal, Saleh is arguing that the<strong> Bush officials were acting from personally held convictions that the US should invade Iraq, regardless of any legitimate policy reasons, and that theyknowingly lied to the public when they fraudulently tied Saddam Hussein to al-Qaeda and the threat of weapons of mass destruction.</strong></p>
<p>Inder Comar, Saleh&#8217;s lawyer, explained, &#8220;Nuremberg held that domestic immunity was not a defense to allegations of international aggression. Everything the Germans did was legal under the law. We are asking the Ninth Circuit to reject the application of domestic immunity in this case, in line with the holdings of Nuremberg.&#8221;</p>
<p>On July 22, Saleh urged the Ninth Circuit to take judicial notice of portions of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645" target="_blank">the Chilcot Report, which makes factual conclusions</a> about the run-up to the Iraq War. A court can take judicial notice of a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute and can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. That includes public records, such as reports issued by a commission of inquiry.</p>
<p>The report was published by the Iraq Inquiry Committee, an independent committee established by the British government, on July 6, 2016, after six years of investigation, research and drafting.</p>
<p>Here are four of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/iraq-inquiry-key-points-from-the-chilcot-report" target="_blank">excerpts from the report</a> that Saleh has submitted to the court for judicial notice:</p>
<blockquote><p>24. President Bush decided at the end of 2001 to pursue a policy of regime change in Iraq.</p>
<p>68. On 26 February, 2002, Sir Richard Dearlove, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, advised that the US Administration had concluded that containment would not work, was drawing up plans for a military campaign later in the year, and was considering presenting Saddam Hussein with an ultimatum for the return of inspectors while setting the bar &#8220;so high that Saddam Hussein would be unable to comply.&#8221;</p>
<p>74 Mr. [UK Foreign Secretary Jack] Straw&#8217;s advice of 25 March proposed that the US and UK should seek an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to re-admit weapons inspectors. That would provide a route for the UK to align itself with the US without adopting the US objective regime change. This reflected advice that regime change would be unlawful.</p>
<p>89. Sir Richard Dearlove reported that he had been told that the US had already taken a decision on action – &#8220;the question was only how and when;&#8221; and that he had been told it intended to set the threshold on weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be able to hold up US policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The report includes copies of notes between Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in which they discussed the invasion of Iraq as early as October 2001.</p>
<p>Eight months before the invasion of Iraq, Blair wrote to Bush, saying &#8220;I will be with you, whatever.&#8221; In July 2002, Blair had told Bush that removing Hussein from power would &#8220;free up the region&#8221; even though Iraqis might &#8220;feel ambivalent about being invaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/10/the-chilcot-report-by-sir-john-chilcot-digested-read-iraq-inquiry" target="_blank">report concluded that Hussein posed no imminent threat</a> on March 20, 2003, the date the US and the UK invaded Iraq. It also noted that a majority of the United Nations Security Council favored continuing UN monitoring and inspections.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Experts Conclude War was Illegal</strong></p>
<p>The committee also published submissions by legal experts who concluded the war was illegal and constituted aggression against Iraq.</p>
<p>Philippe Sands said,<strong> &#8220;Distinguished members of the legal community in the United Kingdom have also concluded without ambiguity that the war was unlawful.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Sir Michael Wood stated, &#8220;the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law,&#8221; in that it<strong> &#8220;had not been authorized by the Security Council, and had no other legal basis in international law.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth Wilmshurst concurred, noting, &#8220;the facts did not justify the use of force in self-defence. Existing Security Council resolutions did not authorize the use of force. There was no other legal justification. A desire to change the regime did not give a legal basis for military action,&#8221; adding, &#8220;I regarded the invasion of Iraq as illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>An international group of lawyers (including former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark and I) filed an amicus brief supporting Saleh&#8217;s legal claims. Clark told Truthout at the time, &#8220;In this case, as many as 3.5 million people have lost their lives as a consequence of the crime of aggression &#8212; the illegal use of force perpetrated against the people of Iraq &#8212; and the country&#8217;s development has been set back countless years.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Allegations Against Team Bush</strong></p>
<p>The UN Charter, which was created by the countries of the world in 1945 to &#8220;save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,&#8221; prohibits the use of military force except in self-defense or with Security Council approval. Neither of these two conditions was present before the US-UK invasion of Iraq. Iraq did not pose an imminent military threat to any UN member country on March 19, 2003, and the Security Council did not approve the invasion.</p>
<p>A &#8220;crime against peace&#8221; is defined by the Nuremberg Charter as &#8220;planning, preparation, initiation or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing.&#8221; The US-UK war against Iraq was a war of aggression.</p>
<p>The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held, &#8220;To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the <em>supreme international crime</em> differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his opening statement as chief US prosecutor at Nuremberg, US Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson said, &#8220;No political, military, economic, or other considerations shall serve as an excuse or justification&#8221; for a war of aggression. He added, &#8220;If certain acts in violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saleh&#8217;s complaint cites statements made by the defendants as early as 1998 which indicate their intention to change Iraq&#8217;s regime. For example, in his testimony before the House National Security Committee on Iraq, Wolfowitz advocated the removal of Hussein and the formation of a provisional government that would &#8220;control the largest oil field in Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>On September 12, 2001, Rumsfeld complained that there were no decent targets for bombing Afghanistan so the United States should consider bombing Iraq, which had better targets. Bush said at the time that the US should change Iraq&#8217;s government.</p>
<p>In July 2002, Dearlove, reporting on recent meetings in the US, said, &#8220;the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bush, Cheney and Rice used faulty intelligence in order to better market a war with Iraq to the American people.</p>
<p>The defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of deceiving the American public into believing that a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq existed in order to win approval for the crime of aggression against Iraq.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2004, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated, &#8220;I have indicated that [the invasion of Iraq] was not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view and from the Charter&#8217;s point of view it was illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justice Jackson called the crime of aggression &#8220;the greatest menace of our times.&#8221; More than 70 years later, his words continue to ring true.</p>
<p>&#8220;The invasion [of Iraq] resulted in the total destruction of a beautiful, peaceful country,&#8221; Saleh told Truthout in 2015. &#8220;The invasion didn&#8217;t destroy only the country&#8217;s infrastructure, buildings and heritage; it destroyed millions of families and their dreams.&#8221;</p>

			<p><em>En los países en vías de desarrollo, al menos 250.000 millones de euros de ingresos fiscales desaparecen cada año en los paraísos fiscales, es decir, seis veces el importe anual necesario para luchar y vencer el hambre hasta 2025.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Cerca de 800 millones de personas pasan hambre en el mundo, principalmente en los países llamados “en desarrollo”. No obstante, en estos países, al menos 250.000 millones de euros de ingresos fiscales desaparecen cada año en los paraísos fiscales, o sea, seis veces el importe anual necesario para luchar y vencer el hambre hasta 2025. “Se ha calculado que entre el 85% y el 90% de esa riqueza pertenece a menos de 10 millones de personas —apenas el 0,014% de la población mundial—, y una tercera parte como mínimo pertenece a las 100.000 familias más ricas del mundo, cada una de las cuales posee un patrimonio neto de 30 millones de dólares como mínimo”, según el <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/31/61&amp;referer=/english/&amp;Lang=S" rel="external">Estudio final sobre los flujos financieros ilícitos</a> de la ONU.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Son entonces los más adinerados los que se aprovechan de la reducción de ingresos fiscales por fraude, lo que perpetúa y empeora las desigualdades. Parece lógico que los más ricos, que se aprovechan de los beneficios de sus empresas, tendrían que contribuir con una redistribución a favor de los más pobres a través del impuesto sobre los beneficios de estas empresas. Sin embargo, la plusvalía generada por la explotación de la fuerza laboral se evapora en territorios paradisíacos para la oligarquía que gobierna y legisla.</p>
<p>Se trata de un robo organizado a gran escala –ilegítimo y no conforme a cualquier idea de desarrollo humano– de una riqueza que pertenece a aquellos y aquellas que la han creado con su trabajo, y que debería financiar los servicios públicos. De hecho, el impuesto sobre los beneficios, así no redistribuido para el bien común porque escapa al fisco, permite al capitalista optimizar la plusvalía obtenida del trabajo intentando, ilegalmente o no, privatizar su totalidad.</p>
<p><strong>El fraude obstaculiza el desarrollo</strong></p>
<p>El fraude y la evasión fiscal, que son practicados por las multinacionales ayudadas por grandes sociedades de auditoría, sobre todo (los famosos big four: Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG y Price Waterhouse Coopers), son una verdadera calamidad que entorpece el avance de un desarrollo real para las poblaciones empobrecidas por estas políticas.</p>
<p>Esta hemorragia de capitales impide la construcción de hospitales y el empleo de médicos con salarios dignos; el equipamiento de escuelas a la altura del reto acompañado de una contratación de profesores para reducir el número de alumnos por clase; la implantación de redes de suministro de agua potable, etc. Para el periodo 2008-2012, <a href="http://www.gfintegrity.org/" rel="external">Global Financial Integrity</a> estima que en 31 países en desarrollo las salidas de fondos ilícitos fueron superiores a los gastos públicos de salud, y que en 35 países en desarrollo fueron superiores a los gastos públicos de enseñanza.</p>
<p>En su informe <a href="http://www.gfintegrity.org/report/illicit-financial-flows-from-developing-countries-2004-2013/" rel="external">Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: 2004-2013</a>, la misma organización constata que los países calificados de “en desarrollo” y las economías emergentes perdieron 7,8 billones de dólares en los flujos financieros ilícitos desde 2004 hasta 2013, con salidas ilícitas cada vez más importantes, aumentando una media de un 6,5% al año, casi dos veces más rápido que el <a name="mot1090_0" href="http://www.cadtm.org/Producto-interno-bruto-PIB"></a>PIBmundial.</p>
<p><strong>Crecimiento de las desigualdades</strong></p>
<p>Tantas necesidades evidentes y, sin embargo, indispensables para el avance de un verdadero desarrollo se abandonan en favor de una clase oligárquica que no para de enriquecerse. El Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (<a name="mot1087_1" href="http://www.cadtm.org/Plan-Marshall,1087"></a>PNUD) ha indicado que el 8% de la población mundial más rica recibe la mitad de la totalidad de los ingresos, mientras que la otra mitad se reparte entre el 92% restante. La riqueza concentrada en manos del 1% más rico ha ascendido al 48% de la riqueza mundial en 2014 frente al 44% en 2010. Durante los últimos 20 años, las desigualdades de los ingresos han aumentado en los países en desarrollo.<br />
El fraude fiscal merece un poco de seriedad, y sobre todo una justicia que sancione a los culpables. En ello va el desarrollo de países empobrecidos por el “sistema <a name="mot1048_2" href="http://www.cadtm.org/Deuda"></a>deuda”. En <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/006/44/PDF/G1600644.pdf?OpenElement" rel="external">su informe</a>, el experto independiente sobre la deuda de la ONU, Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, insiste en la necesidad de combatir los flujos financieros considerados ilícitos, que “contribuyen a la acumulación de una deuda insostenible, porque la falta de ingresos públicos puede forzar a los gobiernos a acudir a los préstamos exteriores”.</p>
<p>En vez de endeudarse para hacer frente a esta hemorragia de capitales que constituye el fraude fiscal, dichos flujos ilícitos privan a los Estados de recursos que podrían financiar actividades indispensables para la eliminación de la pobreza y para la consecución de derechos económicos, sociales, culturales, civiles y políticos.</p>
<p>Al término de este informe, <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/082/64/PDF/G1608264.pdf?OpenElement" rel="external">una resolución</a> sobre la evasión fiscal y la necesidad de devolver los activos malversados a los países calificados de “en desarrollo” fue adoptada a nivel del Consejo de los Derechos Humanos de la ONU. El 24 de marzo de 2016, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/FR/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=18530&amp;LangID=F" rel="external">ningún Estado europeo votó a favor</a>. Bélgica, Francia, Alemania, Países Bajos, Suiza, Reino Unido, Portugal, Albania, Eslovenia, Letonia, Georgia, la República de Corea, la Ex-República yugoslava de Macedonia, México y Panamá se abstuvieron.</p>

<p>Carefully worded diplomatic language following high-level Russia/US meetings conceal intractable positions on resolving conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4138">Things are no closer now than earlier, regardless of public pronouncements. Washington wants its imperial agenda proceeding unobstructed, war its principle strategy of choice.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4141">Years of Russia/US talks proved futile. Expect nothing different this time whatever is announced ahead.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4144">Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said his Monday meeting with Obama “lasted longer than planned,” discussions focusing mainly on Syria and Ukraine, resolving nothing.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4147">“(W)ork will continue,” Peskov explained, perhaps interminably, irreconcilable positions making resolution unattainable.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4150">When leaders, other officials or their spokespersons say talks were constructive or fruitful, they mean major unresolved issues remain.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4153">Putin remained hopeful, saying “collaborative (sic) efforts with the US in fighting terrorist organizations, including ones in Syria, may be significantly improved and intensified.”</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4156">He expressed “grounds to believe” agreement may be reached “within the next few days,” with no further elaboration or acknowledgement that all US agreed on deals aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, systematically breached at Washington’s discretion, at times straightaway.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4159">Obama didn’t wage war on Syria, or any other country he attacked, to quit. The record is clear. All US post-9/11 wars continue endlessly with no prospect for resolution anywhere.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4162">Yet Putin said he “think(s) (Obama) sincerely aims to reach results in fighting terrorism and resolving the Syrian conflict.”</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4165">How when he initiated it? How with America supporting ISIS and other terrorist groups, not combating them? How when Washington considers defenseless civilians legitimate targets, slaughtering them with disturbing regularity?</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4168">How with US warplanes bombing Syrian infrastructure and government targets, not terrorists as claimed? How with CIA operatives and US special forces directing ISIS and other terrorist groups against Syria’s military and civilian population?</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4171">How with America blocking humanitarian aid for desperately needy people? How when peace and stability defeat its agenda? Endless wars of aggression and chaos serve it.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4174">Putin saying he and Obama “reached mutual understanding” fails to acknowledge the futility of dealing with a duplicitous partner.</p>
<p id="yiv2341748206yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1473093231539_4177">He knows the obstacles he faces, notably longstanding US plans for regime change in Russia and all other sovereign independent countries &#8211; why global war with nuclear weapons is humanity’s greatest risk if Hillary succeeds Obama.</p>

			<p><em>The BBC’s rather charming piece entitled “<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36660372">Who is Theresa May: A profile</a>” sets out a life reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher, from her early days as a schoolchild to the ascension to the most powerful job in Britain. It’s a piece littered with affection and sentiment, typical of a state broadcaster.</em></p>
<p>“<em>An early advocate of Conservative “modernisation” in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999 under William Hague as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party’s first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith. She then held a range of senior posts under Michael Howard but was conspicuously not part of the “Notting Hill set” which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne’s path to power.</em>”</p>
<p>The BBC continues with an almost evangelical hysteria, crowing that May “<em>has pledged a shake-up of boardroom ethics as part of which workers will be guaranteed representation on company boards while shareholders votes on executive pay deals will be made binding every year.</em>” I’ll eat my cat if ever that happens!</p>
<p>Even worse, the BBC story went as far as to make direct comparisons with Thatcher, mentioning; “<em>Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke also had run-ins with her and was recorded on camera ahead of an interview last week saying that Mrs May was good at her job but a “bloody difficult woman” – before adding as an aside, a bit like Mrs Thatcher. A reference to be Conservative leader can hardly come better than that</em>.”</p>
<p>Having depicted Theresa May as a tough, good sort, with traditional English stiff upper lip values and a sense of social justice, one could be forgiven for forgetting that she has forced through some of the most oppressive laws Britain has seen since the start of World War Two in what many see as the start of an authoritarian leadership style bordering on dictatorship.</p>
<p><em>OpenRightsGroup says -“This is the fifth time a Government has tried to bring in the Snoopers’ Charter. The Home Office wants to give the police and intelligence services even more powers”</em></p>
<p>The Snoopers Charter or Investigatory Powers Bill should alarm us all as government agencies will very soon have the ability to not just listen into devices but interfere with them at will – it’s an extension of intrusive state power under the rather bland heading of “equipment interference”. Described as a ‘<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/12/theresa-may-surveillance-investigatory-powers-bill-national-security">machiavellian masterpiece</a>‘ it authorises the state to hack our devices, deliver viruses, malware and destructive trojan’s at will. Nothing has been said of the damage that will be caused to our personal devices and equipment, creating openings for hackers to steal financial and personal data, or the fact that most of these hacks and interventions are designed by private companies and sold the government.</p>
<p>Then there’s all the other stuff Theresa May has forced through such as; The censoring of over 1,000 pages of information on the internet each week, introduced secret courts, proposed the scrapping of the Humans Rights Act, classified non-violent activism as terrorism, allowed ministers and government agencies to veto Freedom of Information requests, condoned the arrest of journalists under the anti-terrorism act, forced schools to hand over private pupil information and even threatened a 7 year-old with deportation. <a href="https://tompride.wordpress.com/2016/07/12/how-theresa-may-has-been-slowly-turning-the-uk-into-a-civil-liberties-free-zone/">Tom Pride</a>‘s excellent piece provides all the links for the above and quite rightly states that “Britain is fast becoming a civil liberty free zone.”</p>
<p>Even The Telegraph, a rampant right-wing neoliberal Tory supporting daily headlined with “<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/07/theresa-may-must-not-be-pm-until-she-rejects-the-policy-of-the-b/">Theresa May’s repulsive threat to EU citizens could make the Tories toxic again</a>”</p>
<p>And as our new prime Minster gets her knees under the table at No10, would it come as a surprise to learn that her authoritarian style has actually ordered a clampdown on her own ministers speaking, or even making contact with journalists without gaining explicit prior permission from her office.</p>
<p>The Guardian likens it to ‘control freakery’ as they make light of the alarming characteristics of limiting traditional press freedom enjoyed in the UK for a very long time. An outright ban has even been put on ministers having informal lunches, dinners, or a chat over coffee with friendly and trusted journalists. There are to be no interviews on the radio and definitely none on television. All such activities have to pre-approved from here on in. No10 has press chiefs and special advisors for every department of government to ensure strict adherence.</p>
<p>A text or off-the-cuff comment made to long established, dependable and loyal journalists could be fatal to a career. Ministers are already reporting there is an uncomfortable level of interference coming directly from Theresa May’s office, but these are the new rules for ministers and that’s that.</p>
<p>Theresa May has form. At the Home Office she effectively turned her department into what amounted to a baronial fiefdom that was inaccessible to instruction or even direction from No 10. And this authoritarian style will clearly be a mark of her leadership going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Observer reported that “<em>three government ministers separately told the Observer that they found the level of control alarming, and that they believed it had been introduced to ensure the government spoke with one mind and consistently on all policy matters. One said: “Any media bid now has to be approved, any quote has to be approved, even if it is with a local television or a radio station on a local issue. It is very frustrating and there is a lot of irritation. It means nothing can be done spontaneously even if it is on subjects that are entirely uncontroversial and show the minister and government in a good light</em>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There is apparently an enormous backlog of media requests for access to ministers, frustrating journalists waiting for approvals whilst stories move on.</p>
<p>A healthy relationship between the media and politicians is not just key, but is a basic foundation stone of democracy and the press were getting agitated months ago, hence headlines such as;</p>

<p>If you weren’t convinced of Theresa May’s ability to be openly dictatorial, you only have to look at what happened to The Telegraph when they headlined “<a href="http://order-order.com/2016/07/02/telegraph-pulled-article-critical-theresa-may-campaign-pressure/">Theresa May is a great self-promoter, but a terrible Home Secretary</a>” A demand by May’s team was promptly sent to pull that piece in what amounts to a curtailment of free speech of the press – and the order was just as quickly complied with. Guido-Fawkes pulls no punches (as usual) on explaining the situation and published the entire text should you be inquisative – <a href="http://order-order.com/2016/07/02/read-full-article-pulled-telegraph-pressure-may-campaign/">HERE</a></p>
<p>The Telegraph piece paints an entirely different picture of our latest Prime Minster, who, quite incisively says is a “secretive, rigid, controlling, even vengeful minister, so unpleasant to colleagues that a dread of meetings with her was something that cabinet members from both parties could bond over.” The piece went on to say “Unsurprisingly, Mrs May’s overwhelming concern with taking credit and deflecting blame made for a difficult working relationship with her department, just as her propensity for briefing the press against cabinet colleagues made her its most disliked member in two successive governments.”</p>
<p>Well, if anyone should know about Theresa May, The Telegraph will!</p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 5th, 2016</strong> by Joseph Thomas</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9686"><em>The RAND Corporation was commissioned to publish a report titled, “<a id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9764" href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1140.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">War with China: Thinking Through the Unthinkable</a>,” in which it describes its assessment of possible war between the US and China in the Pacific in both 2015 and in 2025.</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9766">The report’s introduction summarised its findings, stating:</p>
<blockquote id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9769">
<p id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9768"><em id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9767">Premeditated war between the United States and China is very unlikely, but the danger that a mishandled crisis could trigger hostilities cannot be ignored. Thus, while neither state wants war, both states’ militaries have plans to fight one. As Chinese anti-access and area-denial (A2AD) capabilities improve, the United States can no longer be so certain that war would follow its plan and lead to decisive victory. This analysis illuminates various paths a war with China could take and their possible consequences.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report makes an attractive concession to possible Chinese politicians and business leaders (and their counterparts throughout the rest of Asia) who may read the report and be tempted to take it at face value, claiming that war with China, even today, would be costly for the US, and that the window of opportunity for a decisive victory over China will likely be closed come 2025.</p>
<p>However, the report also claims that:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Both sides would suffer large military losses in a severe conflict. In 2015, U.S. losses could be a relatively small fraction of forces committed, but still significant; Chinese losses could be much heavier than U.S. losses and a substantial fraction of forces committed.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The publicly available paper appears to be an attempt to accomplish two things. First, it attempts to play down the possibility of a premeditated US first-strike on Chinese forces, simply because for a first-strike to be most effective, it would  be best done when completely unexpected.</p>
<p>Second, it is an attempt to temper Chinese ambitions in the region driven by increasing Chinese military strength, and may represent an effort to convince some among China’s leadership to take a more conciliatory approach, accommodating a continued US presence and role in the region, rather than fully displacing it. In other words, it is a veiled threat, attempting to coerce Chinese decision makers to forego what is otherwise the inevitable expulsion of US influence from the region.</p>
<p>The report goes on to make recommendations, which include measures intended to prepare for this potential war and to ensure an American edge in it.</p>
<p>These recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The United States should reduce the effect of Chinese A2AD by investing in more-survivable force platforms (e.g., submarines) and in counter-A2AD (e.g., theater missiles).</em></li>
<li><em>The United States should conduct contingency planning with key allies, especially Japan.</em></li>
<li><em>The United States should ensure that the Chinese are specifically aware of the potential for catastrophic results even if a war is not lost militarily.</em></li>
<li><em>The United States should improve its ability to sustain intense military operations.</em></li>
<li><em>U.S. leaders should develop options to deny China access to war-critical commodities and technologies in the event of war.</em></li>
<li><em>The United States should undertake measures to mitigate the interruption of critical products from China.</em></li>
<li><em>Additionally, the U.S. Army should invest in land-based A2AD capabilities, encourage and enable East Asian partners to mount strong defense, improve interoperability with partners (especially Japan), and contribute to the expansion and deepening of Sino-U.S. military-to-military understanding and cooperation to reduce dangers of misperception and miscalculation.</em></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Several of these recommendations would enhance the impact of US first-strike on Chinese forces in the region. And all of these recommendations include a continuous American military build-up in Asia, far beyond America’s own borders and territory, fuelling a climate of ever-looming confrontation and the ever-present threat of potential war for the entirety of Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Continued US Military Build-Up Threatens Asian Stability </strong></p>
</div>
<div>The report warns that a potential war in Asia Pacific would greatly impact China’s trade. This would not only be catastrophic for China, but for the entire Asian region. The report claims:</div>
<blockquote><p><em>Because much of the Western Pacific would become a war zone, China’s trade with the region and the rest of the world would decline substantially.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Examining the economic disposition of the Asian region, one finds that Asia trades primarily within itself, first and foremost, and then abroad to the Americas, Europe and elsewhere. In essence, a US war on China would also be a US war on the rest of Asia’s economy.</p>
<p>US economic influence in Asia falls disproportionately short of the geopolitical primacy it attempts to wield in the region. It is an aspiring global hegemon faced with an entire region growing increasingly independent of the economic and security framework it has attempted to overlay and constrain the region within for nearly a century.</p>
<p>Its Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement represents a modern day form of mercantilism. America’s use of “soft power” through the organisation of disruptive and subversive political groups and terrorist fronts provides a modern-day stand-in for British gunboat diplomacy. And the parallel institutions the US creates through US State Department-funded nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) mirror the imperial administrative networks constructed by the British, French and Dutch throughout the region before World War II to compete against, and eventually take over local institutions.</p>
<p>Yet despite all these reimagined, modernised hegemonic constructs, Asian states with unified populations, strong economies and increasingly capable military and security agencies seem capable of incrementally displacing America’s unwarranted influence from the region nonetheless. And just like the empires whose institutions the US is attempting to perpetuate in Asia Pacific, the US seeks to divide these nations against themselves and their neighbours to create a weakened region it can reassert itself over.</p>
<p>This is the genesis of the present South China Sea conflict. Of course, real rivalries do exist, not just between China and its Southeast Asian neighbours, but between these Southeast Asian states themselves.</p>
<p>Through the use of soft power and America’s formidable media influence, it has attempted to amplify these manageable bilateral differences into a regional conflict, then place itself amid it, posing as an indispensable underwriter of Asian security and stability. It can then manage the crisis ensuring maximum tension and division across the region, weakening it as a whole and allowing the United States to reassert its primacy.</p>
<p>It is a dangerous game that if played well by Washington will still cost Asia its collective economic potential well into the foreseeable future. However, if played poorly, it could degenerate into the very sort of armed conflict the RAND Corporation paper described, leading the region into unpredictable and open-ended disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Stability in Asia is the Only Option </strong></p>
<p>For Asia, stability equals prosperity and progress. The region is already creating inter-economic incentives that encourage nations to choose peace over confrontation regarding bilateral disagreements and territorial claims. Simultaneously, each respective nation must continue to build up their military forces to reduce the temptation of resorting to, or inviting, armed coercion. Building up various mechanisms to enhance this balance of power, thus creating a multipolar regional order will be the key to a prosperous Asia well into the future.</p>
<p>The presence of the United States will remain a constant source of instability undermining this process, primarily because its own stated objective is not to create a multipolar balance of power for the region, but to achieve and maintain regional unipolar primacy for itself.</p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9776">This by necessity requires the United States to temper, contain or even roll back the economic and political progress and influence of not only China, but of any Asian state in the region who threatens American primacy. It requires a constant regime of destabilisation across the entire region.</p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9774">Indeed, the prospect of a US-Chinese war in Asia Pacific is unthinkable, but the possibility of such a war exists only because the US insists on maintaining a disproportionate, unwarranted amount of influence in a region it itself is not even geographically located in.</p>
<p>Ideally, to defuse this potential catastrophe, one of the two belligerents should be removed from the regional equation. Since China is located in Asia, its removal is out of the question, thus, through the process of elimination, that means America should and must be the party who withdraws.</p>
<p>Since it won’t, it will take concerted and incremental effort from all Asian states to gradually reduce America’s presence and influence in the region to rational and constructive proportions. This must be done while resisting the temptation to cynically exploit US meddling in the region to enhance one nation’s position against its neighbour, only to be targeted next once the region is collectively weakened through continued conflict.</p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472907748318_9781">For Asia to grow, it requires stability. The US promises only instability and confrontation for the next decade, and is even openly preparing for a war it admits will devastate the region. It is a war that will only be fought because the US refuses to withdraw from a region it has no legitimate claim to in the first place. The choice for Asia, should it wish to move forward in peace and prosperity is clear. Through unity, the region can remove the real danger to their collective security and stability, a danger that would extort the region through threat of war in order to be allowed to remain.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 5th, 2016</strong> by The New Atlas</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p><em>As US-backed opposition groups take to the streets of Venezuela, following previously failed US-backed uprisings to effect regime change in the South American nation, Western analysts are particularly optimistic about the chances of success now considering the teetering state of Venezuela&#8217;s economy.</em></p>
<p>The UK Independent in an article titled, &#8220;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/venezuela-accuses-us-of-plotting-coup-as-washington-warns-of-imminent-collapse-a7029386.html">Venezuela accuses US of plotting coup as Washington warns of &#8216;imminent collapse&#8217;</a>,&#8221; would state:</p>
<blockquote><p>The relationship between the US and Venezuela has for many years been nothing less than toxic.</p>
<p>In 2002, then President Hugo Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup by opponents supported by the US. Washington continued to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to his critics, while Mr Chavez took to the podium of the UN to accuse George W Bush of being the devil.</p>
<p>Now, President President Nicolas Maduro has extended a state of emergency in the country for another 60 days and accused Washington of plotting against him, as US intelligence has claimed the country is heading for meltdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article would also claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>An economic state of emergency has been in force in Venezuela since January, including rationing of food and other goods. The country is facing economic [crisis] largely because of the crash in oil prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper also admits:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;observers of the region point out that the US has a long history of seeking to interfere in the politics of Venezuela, as well as elsewhere in Latin America.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting those who ousted Mr Chavez in 2002, the US poured hundreds of thousands of dollars to his opponents via the so-called National Endowment for Democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the economic conditions leading up to what appears to be another round of US-backed regime change efforts, the possibility that in addition to US sanctions against Venezuela and the global manipulation of oil prices to target both Venezuela and Russia, that the US is using other, covert methods to sabotage the nation&#8217;s economy are not entirely far-fetched.<br />

<p>An ABC News article titled, &#8220;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82588&amp;page=1">CIA Admits Involvement in Chile</a>,&#8221; would admit:</p>
<blockquote><p>The CIA is acknowledging for the first time the extent of its deep involvement in Chile, where it dealt with coup-plotters, false propagandists and assassins.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the CIA&#8217;s own website under a post titled simply, &#8220;<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/chile/">CIA Activities in Chile</a>,&#8221; it is admitted that (our emphasis):</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the Church Committee report, in their meeting with CIA Director Richard Helms and Attorney General John Mitchell on 15 September 1970 President Nixon and his National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, directed the CIA to prevent Allende from taking power. They were “not concerned [about the] risks involved,” according to Helms’ notes. <strong>In addition to political action, Nixon and Kissinger, according to Helms’s notes, ordered steps to “make the economy scream.”</strong></p>
<p>These Cold War attitudes persisted into the Pinochet era. After Pinochet came to power, senior policymakers appeared reluctant to criticize human rights violations, taking to task US diplomats urging greater attention to the problem. <strong>US military assistance and sales grew significantly during the years of greatest human rights abuses.</strong> According to a previously released Memorandum of Conversation, Kissinger in June 1976 indicated to Pinochet that the US Government was sympathetic to his regime, although Kissinger advised some progress on human rights in order to improve Chile’s image in the US Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>Overthrowing the government required first a pretext. Public dissatisfaction over economic conditions is perhaps the most intuitive when targeting public perception and it appears to have been a key component in US calculus during the overthrow of Chile&#8217;s government.</p>
<p>In essence, US intervention in Chile, just like its interventions across the planet today, are merely draped in rhetoric regarding the defence of democracy, human rights and economic progress. In reality, the US seeks to remove governments posing as obstacles to US economic and geopolitical interests in favour of those that facilitate them, regardless of how much worse such regimes generally end up being regarding human rights and economic progress.</p>
<p>Venezuela is no different. The current government is not an enemy of the United States because of human rights abuses, a lack of &#8220;democracy&#8221; or for posing a legitimate threat to US national security. It is an enemy of the United States because it is obstructing US economic and geopolitical ambitions in the region as well as US aspirations toward greater global hegemony in general.</p>
<p>Those the US seeks to replace the current Venezuelan government with will undoubtedly trample the rights and lives of those opposed to it, through equal or greater atrocities than the current government is accused of. Instead of anything resembling progress for the people of Venezuela, the nation will be intentionally kept underdeveloped, mired in domestic and regional conflict, specifically to help maintain the hegemony of US interests.</p>
<p>Far from conspiracy theories, US history and current US foreign policy confirms the systematic subversion and destruction of South America, including Venezuela, toward the fulfilment of self-serving interests that will leave the people of South America further mired in tragedy, not help them transcend it.</p>

			<p><strong>Riyadh has transferred nearly 5,000 militants from a number of terrorist groups from Aden port to Eritrea&#8217;s Assab port</strong> to go under military trainings and then be sent to the Saudi provinces bordering Yemen, sources said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The terrorists, some of whom are from the Al-Qaeda, will be dispatched to Najran, Jizzan and Asir provinces to fight against the Yemeni army and popular forces and prevent their further advances in Southern Saudi Arabia,&#8221; the sources stated on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>They added that the Yemeni forces&#8217; advances deep inside the Saudi territories have frightened the Saudi officials more than the ballistic missiles fired from Yemen.</strong></p>
<p>Also, Hossein al-Houthi, a commander of the Yemeni popular forces, told FNA that his forces have managed to retake control of several villages from the Saudi mercenaries and destroyed five of their tanks, their military outposts and a command room of the Saudi-led coalition in Ta&#8217;iz province.</p>
<p>Reports said on Friday that Yemen&#8217;s long-range home-made missile dubbed as Borkan-1 (Volcano-1) hit deep inside Saudi Arabia in response to the kingdom&#8217;s massacre of civilians in the impoverished nation.</p>
<p>Borkan-1 has a range of 800 kilometers and is a new generation of Yemen&#8217;s domestically-made missiles, Yemen&#8217;s Defense Ministry announced in a statement.</p>
<p>The Yemeni defense ministry did not mention the exact location of the targets that Borkan-1 missile has hit.</p>
<p>It, however, said that the warhead of Barkan-1 missile has been designed to destroy the Saudi military base structure with respect to the materials used in their construction.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Yemeni army and popular forces hit the Saudi military positions in the kingdom&#8217;s Najran province with a Zalzal-3 ballistic missile in retaliation for the Saudi airstrikes on residential areas across Yemen.</p>
<p>The Yemeni missile attack inflicted heavy losses on the Saudi troops in Najran province.</p>
<p><strong>Early reports indicated large casualties on the Saudi forces in the missile attack. The Saudi army and its coalition members have lost, at least, over a hundred troops each time they have come under a ballistic missile attack by Yemen.</strong></p>
<p>The Saudi-led forces&#8217; armored vehicles were destroyed during the Yemeni missile attack.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 5th, 2016</strong> by Edward Curtin</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><em>In a country with a Mount Rushmore that celebrates the ruthless and frenetic westward expansion, it might be a bit naïve to suggest a <strong>Do Nothing Day</strong>. I have nothing against laboring men and women having their day too; I am a laborer myself, and national holidays are great – so many sales for stuff no one needs.</em></p>
<p>To rush less, to idle, and to do nothing sounds so un-American, yet it might be a solution to many of our country’s problems.  Quixotic as it may sound, if every person in the country could be convinced to lay aside his compulsive busyness for one day per month, for starters, this not-doing would paradoxically accomplish so much.  Nothing is a funny word, as Shakespeare well knew.  There is so much to it; “much ado” as he put it.  It is the great motivator.  While it frightens people, it is also the spur to creativity.  Samuel Beckett once astutely said, “Nothing is more real than nothing.”  It is the void, the womb, the empty space out of which we come and live out our days.  It is the background silence for all our noise.  Like the rain, it is purely gratuitous.  Such a gift should not be shunned.</p>
<p>By doing nothing I mean the following: no work, just free play; no travel, except by foot or bicycle; no use of technology of any sort except stoves for cooking meals to share; no household repairs or projects; no buying or selling of any kind, including thinking of buying and selling.  You get the point.  This not-doing doing could be called dreaming or simply being.  It’s a tough task indeed, but fitting for the paradoxical creatures that we are.  And that’s just for individuals.</p>
<p>Nationally, all businesses would be closed, factories would be idled, planes and trains grounded.  Only emergency services – hospitals, police, etc. would be allowed to operate.  Quixotic, yes, but our national leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike, are surely apt to agree since it would add one more day to their monthly schedules of doing “nothing.” Making my point in a slightly different way, Mark Twain said, “Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress.  But I repeat myself.”</p>
<p>Think of how much we would accomplish by doing nothing!  People might dream and think; they might hear birds singing or even sing themselves; they might have real conversations; they might feel the peace of a wild idleness; our ecological matrix would have a brief chance to catch its breath; a massive amount of energy would be saved and little carbon would be spewed into the atmosphere (a rather startling statistic could be inserted here).  The benefits are endless &#8211; and all from doing nothing.</p>
<p>The immediate downside would be millions of mental breakdowns of the do-something addicts.  Their agony from trying to do nothing would be excruciating.  A friend from another country where they still take siestas and celebrate doing nothing was kind enough to suggest a rapid resolution to this mass madness. Kill these do-somethings.  Since they are not good for nothing while alive, she said, and can’t help contaminating the earth with their compulsive busyness, why keep them around. She advocated enlisting the help of the Pentagon for this work since killing is their business and they are good at it.  While acknowledging the aptness of her suggestion, I told her I thought the Pentagon was much too busy killing foreigners to get involved in a domestic caper at this time.  It also raises a number of other practical problems, the biggest being how and where to bury so many busybodies all at once.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people who have so utterly forgotten their childhood’s lovely ability to do nothing are far too old and tough and set in their skins to be used as food, as another wag of my acquaintance suggested.  Even trying a little tenderizer on their frazzled flesh wouldn’t work.  After all, when Jonathan Swift had that profound idea of how to solve the Irish famine problem, he was suggesting soft and tender one year olds be slaughtered and sold to the wealthy since they would make “delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled.”  But older, compulsive, do-something people, set in their ways, while seemingly organic – a good thing these days – are tough and sinewy – a not very appetizing thought.  I doubt there would be much demand for their meat.</p>
<p>Therefore, in all due respect, let me suggest another way to proceed.  I think it best to let them go mad on Do Nothing Days.  They will bounce back on the intervening go-go days but should eventually get so discouraged by having to stop once a month that they will commit suicide.  That way they’ll get what they didn’t want – a quite long stretch of days doing nothing, if eternity has days.  And the survivors can live guilt-free, since all they did was nothing.</p>
<p>As you can see, the downsides to Do Nothing Days are small compared to the benefits.  But convincing people to adopt my plan won’t be easy.  Long ago I stopped giving advice to friends and family since whatever I suggested seemed to encourage them to do the opposite.  Yet here I go again, suggesting this big Do Nothing Day.  So I will desist in the name of the law of reversed effort.</p>
<p>I really don’t want to organize a movement to establish particular days for this not-doing.  I don’t want to establish a cult and be a cult leader. I’m really too busy for that.  My schedule is too packed for such a job.  Maybe you have time.  I have too much to do.  I say, “Nothing doing.”</p>
<p>I was once rushing to take groceries to my elderly mother when I ran into the sharp metal edge of a stop sign. Stunned and coming to on my back on the pavement with blood dripping down my face, it bemused me to think how fast I was stopped.  Ever since, I’ve been on the go.</p>
<p>Nothing showed me his face.</p>
<p>Yet here and there I have this dream of a Do Nothing Day.  It’s the dream of a ridiculous man, isn’t it?</p>

			<p><em>While Monsanto continues to deny that glysophate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is a carcinogen, the World Health Organization’s cancer research department, the International Agency on Cancer Research (IARC), has classified the substance as “probably carcinogenic.”  In addition, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment now lists glysophate<a href="https://www.levinlaw.com/monsanto-roundup-lawsuit-cancer-link"> as a “known carcinogen</a>,” while a prominent scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has found it to be “the most important factor in the development of multiple chronic diseases and conditions that have become prevalent in Westernized societies.” But recent research indicates that glysophate may not be the worst part of Roundup.</em></p>
<p>Most scientific studies on Roundup (not sponsored by Monsanto) have focused on the effects of the primary ingredient. However, a <a href="http://www.gmoseralini.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Seralini-career-JBPC_2015.pdf">French research study published a year ago</a> revealed that the “inert” ingredients in Roundup actually increase its toxicity, even at very low concentrations. The study was led by <strong>Gilles-Eric Seralini,</strong> a molecular biologist at the University of Caen who has done extensive research into GMOs and pesticides. What they discovered was alarming, to say the least. For example, one of the “inert” ingredients in Roundup is <em>polyethoxylated tallow amine</em>, or POEA. This is a substance derived from the fat of bovine species. It is used as a surfactant, or emulsifier. Amazingly, the USDA allows POEA in “certified organic” products, and the EPA has determined that it is environmentally safe and poses no threat to public health.</p>
<p>Seralini and his team found evidence to the contrary. They have discovered that POEA by itself has a deadly effect on placental, umbilical and embryonic cells – even at concentrations as low as .01%, or one part per ten thousand. Interestingly, they did not observe this toxic effect with glysophate salt by itself at the same concentration; however, when mixed with POEA, it proved fatal to virtually all living tissues. In the published study, Seralini and his colleagues wrote that their research “clearly confirms that the [inert ingredients] in Roundup formulations are not inert…the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death [at the] residual levels.”</p>
<p>The “residual levels” referred to are the same levels found on soy, maize and alfalfa crops as well as lawns and gardens. Seralini and his colleagues found evidence to indicate that even low exposure to Roundup can interfere with hormone production, which in turn can cause pregnant women to miscarry, or result in birth defects.</p>
<p>What is appalling is that this study has been out for some time – and yet few in the United States are even aware of it. Meanwhile, several other countries that include France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Japan and New Zealand have banned the use of Roundup – and that list is getting longer. What do their government officials know that ours do not?</p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 5th, 2016</strong> by Ruslan Ostashko</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><em>The most important information event of Friday was Vladimir Putin’s interview with Bloomberg, in which the Russian president touched on key issues on the global information agenda. I am sure that dozens of publications are going over this interview and discussing every question and answer in it, but I want to propose to you, dear friends, to look at this from a different angle.</em></p>
<p>The point is that <strong>John Micklethwait</strong>, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg who interviewed the Russian president, is not merely a journalist, but one of many journalists who has participated for many years in meetings of the Bilderberg Club as a full member of this shadow interest group whose opinions determine the policies of Western countries. I think that this explains the unusual format of the interview and the fact that Vladimir Putin called Micklethwait a “specialist” and debated with him more like a politician than a journalist…</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-05/vladimir-putin-on-trump-clinton-oil-economics-japan-and-syria">To view the Bloomberg Video Interview</a> </strong></p>
<p>If we look at the interview with Putin from this point of view, then we see that this can be considered as Putin’s response to the Western political elite. Here are the key points which I would like to highlight.</p>
<p>John Micklethwait inquired as to whether Putin is ready to exchange or sell the Kuril Islands and Kaliningrad, a question which immediately received a sharp response from the Russian president. The response on the Kuril islands was done in traditional Putin style, said to the effect that &#8220;Russia does not trade territories, but looks for agreements that suit both parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Kaliningrad, Putin outlined the following perspective for this representative of Bilderberg: if someone starts revising the outcome of the Second World War, then the question can be immediately raised about Germany’ eastern territories, where Lvov belongs, and the borders of Romania and Hungary. If anyone wants to open “Pandora’s box”, as Putin put it, then “go ahead with flag in hand.” John Micklethwait hastened to say the he was joking. But the video intereview shows that Putin did not appreciate this “joke.”</p>
<p>The second important point was when John Micklethwait asked Putin about Russian gold-currency reserves, budget deficits, and oil prices. He, like many Russian liberals, distorted Putin’s quote on oil production falling if oil prices fall below $80 a barrel. But Putin reasonably replied that we have enough currency reserves by all standards and a moderate budget deficit. To the question of oil prices, the Russian president remarked that investments in oil production have fallen sharply given current prices. This is what he had in mind, not what certain journalists are misquoting him as saying.</p>
<p>Here you can see the graph compiled by Bloomberg itself which, ironically, indicates that the Russian president is absolutely right.</p>
<p><a title="Open in new window" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Je8mcMn6Hxw/V8q1rCjPsvI/AAAAAAAAEJ0/MOehJ8ASlnUCthOH9fELRqfais-MsJzMwCLcB/s1600/CrFXAUZXYAEOBCn.jpg" target="_blank" rel="lightbox[5544087]"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Je8mcMn6Hxw/V8q1rCjPsvI/AAAAAAAAEJ0/MOehJ8ASlnUCthOH9fELRqfais-MsJzMwCLcB/s640/CrFXAUZXYAEOBCn.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="376" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Due to low oil prices, no one is investing in the exploration of new reserves, hence why the number and size of new oil fields in 2015 and 2016 fell to zero. This means that, in the future, we inevitably await a shortage of oil and corresponding higher prices. Putin&#8217;s response can be interpreted as a subtle hint at the serious economic circumstances which our Western partners will not find to their liking.</p>
<p>We must give credit to the Bilderberg club’s representative &#8211; he really tried to provoke the Russian president to give him the answers he wanted. In particular, he tried to present Putin as a staunch enemy of Europe who desires the collapse of the Eurozone, the destruction of the Euro, and the complete collapse of the European project. After all, what better way to support anti-Russian propaganda in Europe than with the words of the Russian president himself? Putin, as expected, did not take the bait. He wished Europeans the best of luck in fighting the crisis and remarked that he is critical of the EU’s foreign policy, but that Russia hopes for the European economy to improve.</p>
<p>The second failed provocation was when Micklethwait attempted to force Putin to publicly support Donald Trump as candidate for President of the United States, or at least admit that Russia was behind the hacking attack on the Democratic Party’s servers. This provocation failed, as Putin declared his readiness to work with any American president capable of complying with agreements. So that this would be less painful for the interviewer, he added that he understands why the American public was so surprised by the information that hackers exposed. Translated from diplomatic language into English, his remark sounded so: “Yeah, everyone knows that you have a rotten political system &#8211; enough making it a comedy out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the final important element: the Russian president stressed that if anyone in the American leadership tries to “get rid of us,” we will survive and “who knows who will lose more with such an approach.”</p>
<p>Then Putin broke the interview format and asked a direct question to the Bilderberg Club representative. Putin asked whether he wants to repeat the Cuban Missile Crisis. John Micklethwait quickly replied that “no one wants to.” From my point of view, this was another clear and unambiguous message to our Western partners. As they say, a kind word and a nuclear weapon can achieve more than just a kind word. All that remains is to hope that our Western partners will draw the right conclusions from the Russian president’s words.</p>

			<p><em>Annual summits accomplish little more than a chance for world leaders to interface one-on-one in well-planned sessions with counterparts of special importance.</em></p>
<p>It gives Putin one of many opportunities to meet with China’s Xi Jinping, his main geopolitical ally, discussing key issues of mutual interest, including a belligerent US-dominated NATO threatening world peace.</p>
<p>He met with Turkish despot Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov, saying “(t)hey talked for quite a long time, both in the format of the delegations meeting and one-on-one plus the foreign ministers. They then exchanged views on the Syrian issue. The conversation was quite frank and thorough.”</p>
<p>“(T)hey spoke about a rough schedule for restoring” normalized relations, complicated by Turkish aggression in northern Syria on the phony pretext of combating ISIS, its ally, not enemy, along with other anti-Syrian terrorist groups warring against its sovereign independence and democratically elected leadership.</p>
<p>Clearly Russia is displeased, releasing little more than pro forma public comments so far. What’s happening privately may be entirely different.</p>
<p>Putin no doubt made his displeasure known to Erdogan during their weekend meeting, not enough to change his plans. Twelve days after so-called Operation Euphrates Shield began, Turkish media reported government forces and terrorists Ankara supports control Syrian territory 24 km south of Turkey’s border, west of the Euphrates River.</p>
<p>A second front was opened in Aleppo province, Prime Minister Binali Yildrim fooling no one, saying military operations will continue until the terrorist threat is eliminated. Wannabe sultan Erdogan has Ottoman empire restoration ambitions in mind, annexing parts of northern Syria and Iraq part of his plan.</p>
<p>He’s allied with Washington against Syrian sovereign independence, along with other rogue states wanting regime change.</p>
<p>On the G-20 sidelines, bilateral Russia/US meetings were held. Sergey Lavrov and John Kerry met following discussions before the summit began.</p>
<p>Putin and Obama met face-to-face for the first time since last November’s Climate Conference in Paris, Tass saying contact was initiated by the US president.</p>
<p>Both leaders spoke several times briefly on day one, a second meeting held on Monday. Topics discussed included ongoing US-instigated conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.</p>
<p>The State Department indicated no agreement on major sticking points &#8211; blaming Russia for US obstructionism, saying Moscow “walked back on some of the areas we were agreed on, so we are” continuing discussions.</p>
<p>Kerry said he and Lavrov will talk further on Monday. Expect no resolution no matter what’s announced, if anything.</p>
<p>Both sides are intractably apart. Washington wants war, regime change and Syria transformed into another US vassal state &#8211; eliminating an Israeli rival while isolating Iran at the same time.</p>
<p>Russia wants peace, Syrian sovereignty, territorial integrity and will of its people respected. The result after endless high-level talks: deadlock with no prospect for conflict resolution in sight.</p>
<p>With his tenure winding down, Obama is largely laying groundwork for his successor to take over &#8211; Hillary in all likelihood, militantly anti-Assad, virtually certain to escalate conflict dangerously, risking direct confrontation with Russia, China and Iran.</p>
<p>Things ahead look grim, global war far more likely than any chance for world peace &#8211; a frightening possibility media scoundrels ignore.</p>

			<p><em>US foreign policy regarding Syria publicly vacillates between seeking to defeat the Islamic State to achieving regime change in Damascus. Even at face value, these two objectives are contradictory, even paradoxical.</em></p>
<p>Overthrowing the government of Libya in 2011 thrust extremist groups (used by the US to overthrow Tripoli in the first place) into power across the nation, leaving it bitterly divided and in constant conflict since. The collapse of a unified Libya also allowed Al Qaeda and its spin-off, the Islamic State, to flourish unchecked. There is little evidence to suggest that anything else but precisely this scenario would also unfold should the government in Damascus likewise be overthrown.<br />
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MCveC8Q0O2Q/V8lpYgrNz4I/AAAAAAAAOOY/zwopbypKA18XnQtSACR7G-viqEy20fKMQCLcB/s1600/Syria_2578419f.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544020]" title="Empowering Terrorism to "Stop" Terrorism: America's Foreign Policy in Syria Summed Up in Three Headlines"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MCveC8Q0O2Q/V8lpYgrNz4I/AAAAAAAAOOY/zwopbypKA18XnQtSACR7G-viqEy20fKMQCLcB/s640/Syria_2578419f.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" border="0" /></a><br />
The conflict in Syria, raging since it was triggered by US-backed armed groups in 2011, has in fact created the very conditions in which the Islamic State rose to prominence, springing forth from designated terrorist organisation, Jabhat Al Nusra, also known as Al Qaeda in Syria. In other words, it was the pursuit of regime change by the US that gave rise to the very extremism it now claims it is involved in Syria, Iraq and now also Libya to defeat.</p>
<p>In order to defeat armed extremism, order must be returned to a unified Syria under a government capable of maintaining it. The only government capable of doing this is being intentionally dismembered and undermined by Washington and its allies.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><strong>1. Empowering Terrorism to &#8220;Stop&#8221; Terrorism </strong></p>
<p>Newsweek published an article titled, &#8220;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/how-us-can-win-syria-495076">How the U.S. Can Win in Syria</a>,&#8221; written by Brookings Institution policymaker Michael O&#8217;Hanlon. In it, he claims;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we need to be somewhat more willing to work with groups that are tainted by past association with the Nusra Front, as long as we can vouch for the fact that they are not themselves Nusra members. We should give them anti-tank missiles—though not anti-aircraft missiles—and much more help in terms of ammunition, logistics assistance and food, to help them build up their forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite literally, a US policymaker is calling for the bolstering of groups tied to Jubhat Al Nusra, a US State Department designated foreign terrorist organisation and the very source of the Islamic State&#8217;s rise to power in the first place to &#8221;defeat ISIS, defeat the Nusra Front and replace Assad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only are there few groups that have &#8220;past&#8221; rather than very current associations with Jubhat Al Nusra, many more groups, including those directly backed by the US <a href="http://www.thenewatlas.org/2016/08/moderates-fighting-under-re-branded.html">have recently, openly joined under the terrorist organisation&#8217;s banner</a> to fight in and around Syria&#8217;s northern city of Aleppo.</p>
<div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qE66n3zLCDk/V8lqSVqxh1I/AAAAAAAAOOg/Sr2IAf7iNBoGjButijwRETuKCHlSSvT2wCLcB/s1600/al-nusra-front-syria-1024x576.jpg" rel="lightbox[5544020]" title="Empowering Terrorism to "Stop" Terrorism: America's Foreign Policy in Syria Summed Up in Three Headlines"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qE66n3zLCDk/V8lqSVqxh1I/AAAAAAAAOOg/Sr2IAf7iNBoGjButijwRETuKCHlSSvT2wCLcB/s640/al-nusra-front-syria-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>In reality, only the toppling of the Syrian government will be achieved by such a policy, leaving Syria divided and destroyed, overrun by heavily armed extremist groups empowered by US foreign policy.</p>
<p>And while this may seem like rudderless policy by a Western centre of power losing its grip on reality, it is in fact an intentional, very cynical effort to turn Syria into a failed state, just as was done to Libya and use it as a springboard to launch large-scale, armed proxy military campaigns against Syria&#8217;s neighbours and allies, most notably Iran and southern Russia. It should be remembered that in 2011, after the fall of the Libyan government, US-armed militants were immediately moved into Turkey from where they launched operations into northern Syria and in particular, Aleppo.</p>
<p>Thus, US foreign policy, no matter how many times it is claimed that it seeks to confront and defeat extremism in Syria and Iraq, fully intents to expand it not only in the region, but  far beyond it as well.</p>
<p><strong>2. Perpetuating the Misery of the Syrian People </strong></p>
<p>While the US publicly claims its seeks to end the destructive conflict in Syria often citing humanitarian concerns as a pretext for greater direct involvement in the conflict and for placing greater pressure on Damascus and its allies, in reality the US seeks to deepen, widen and indefinitely perpetuate the destruction of Syria, just as it has done in Libya.</p>

<p>In a Washington Post article titled, &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/02/syrias-message-to-tourists-come-back-enjoy-our-beaches/">Syria’s message to tourists: Come back, enjoy our beaches</a>,&#8221; writer Adam Taylor condemns any notion that parts of Syria may be returning to normal as US-backed militants face defeats and Damascus gains the upper hand.</p>
<p>The article concludes by claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>The message sent by all this publicity might not only be aimed at tourists — but foreign governments and Syrians as well. Wael Aleji of the Syrian Network for Human Rights told the Telegraph last year that these tourism efforts were in fact “psychological warfare” against Assad&#8217;s opponents, designed to send the message that the parts of the country — exclusively those held by the Syrian regime — are safe again.</p></blockquote>
<p>That the Western media reacts with scorn to the notion of normality returning to the lives of Syrians reflects a Western foreign policy that seeks to achieve its goals in Syria or burn the nation to the ground. It illustrates the truth behind the West&#8217;s use of &#8220;humanitarian concerns&#8221; as a facade behind which human misery is created and perpetuated, not exposed and defused. It is an example of the depravity that truly underpins the West&#8217;s direct and proxy interventions worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>3. The US Fully Plans to Betray all of its Allies in Syria </strong></p>
<p>Considering the above facts, it would be foolish for interests within Syria, including the Kurds, to believe that the US is involved for any other purpose other than serving US interests. The very moment those interests diverge from assisting US allies on the ground, such assistance will be terminated. If for some reason these allies become an obstacle to US ambitions in the region, they will be terminated as well.</p>
<p>So obvious is this reality that even the New York Times in its article, &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/world/middleeast/kurds-syria-turkey.html">Kurds Fear the U.S. Will Again Betray Them, in Syria</a>,&#8221; notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is little sign that the United States has abandoned the Syrian Kurds. American officials have worked to negotiate a truce on the ground between the rebels backed by Turkey and the Kurdish militia, known as the People’s Protection Units, and fighting has calmed in recent days.</p>
<p>But many Kurds say they now see the writing on the wall and worry that once the Islamic State is driven from its capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the United States will sell them out.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course, careful study of American history proves that not only will the United States &#8221;sell out&#8221; the Kurds, they will stand by, even possibly assist the necessary &#8220;pruning&#8221; of emerging Kurdish influence in northeastern Syria to satisfy much more important requirements regarding relations between Ankara and Washington.</p>
<p>US foreign policy has always been cynical, violent, treacherous and even disastrously shortsighted and self-serving. The above three headlines shows merely the continuation of these policies unfolding in an information space where hiding the true characteristics of US ambitions behind either patriotic or humanitarian rhetoric is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Whether or not this opportunity to more frankly appraise US ambitions sways public opinion either within the US or abroad to discourage such policies in favour of a more reasonable and constructive American engagement with the rest of the world remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>The United States is attempting highlight the historical nature of an upcoming visit to the Southeast Asian state of Laos by US President Barack Obama. By doing so, the US hopes perhaps the rhetorical narrative of the visit can compensate for a lack of real political substance.In an official White House statement titled, “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/18/statement-press-secretary-presidents-trip-china-and-laos?utm_source=iipeditorial&amp;utm_medium=englishsmf&amp;utm_campaign=ysealitoolkit&amp;utm_content=ysealipost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Statement by the Press Secretary on the President’s Trip to China and Laos</a>,” US spokespeople claimed:</p>
<div>
<blockquote id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472655680136_12198"><p>President Obama will travel to China and Laos September 2-9, 2016. This trip will highlight the President’s ongoing commitment to the G-20 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation as well as the U.S. Rebalance to Asia and the Pacific.</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement would also claim:</p>
<blockquote id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472655680136_12200"><p>President Obama will be the first U.S. president to visit Laos, where he will participate in the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit. Additionally, he will have bilateral meetings with President Bounnhang Vorachith and other key officials to advance U.S.-Lao cooperation on economic, development, and people-to-people ties, among other areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House statement would also mention President Obama’s intentions to participate in the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative  (YSEALI) Summit, <a href="http://journal-neo.org/2016/08/30/us-cultural-colonisation-in-asia-pacific/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an indoctrination program with strong parallels to both British and Roman imperial strategies</a> used to “culturally colonize” targeted nations, regions, and peoples.Finally and most revealing, the statement claims (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472655680136_12203"><p>This visit also will support the President’s efforts to expand opportunities for American businesses and workers to sell their products in some of the world’s fastest-growing markets. <strong>Central to this effort is the Trans-Pacific Partnership [TPP]</strong>, the high-standards trade agreement that will unlock key markets to American exports and cement America’s economic leadership in the Asia-Pacific.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the US president’s visit to Asia, particularly Laos, is to expand – or perhaps attempt to reassert – US influence and more specifically control over the region.</p>
<p>From presiding over the YSEALI summit – indoctrinating and training youth from across Southeast Asia to serve amongst America’s vast network of faux-nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) – to pushing the unsolicited and very unpopular TPP trade agreement, the president’s visit represents a continuation of America’s coercive and disruptive brand of geopolitics standing in stark contrast to China, whom the US finds itself increasingly being pushed out of the region by.</p>
<p><strong>Battlefield Laos </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Though rarely in the headlines, what is playing out in Laos is a powerful microcosm of a much larger geopolitical struggle unfolding across Asia.Even if all other metrics were even – the US would have an uphill battle before itself in challenging Chinese influence in the small but pivotal landlocked nation. Laos suffered immensely from America’s war with Vietnam in the 1960s-70s. According to the UN-funded Washington-based “<a href="http://legaciesofwar.org/about-laos/secret-war-laos/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Legacies of War” organization</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1472655680136_12213"><p>…from 1964 to 1973, the U.S. dropped more than two million tons of ordnance on Laos during 580,000 bombing missions—equal to a planeload of bombs every 8 minutes, 24-hours a day, for 9 years – making Laos the most heavily bombed country per capita in history.</p></blockquote>
<p>To this day, even as President Obama prepares to visit Laos, nearly 100 Laotians a year are killed or maimed by US ordnance still littering the nation’s landscape.</p>
<p>In addition to this enduring and unenviable legacy, the US’ activities in Laos since the war have been less than constructive to say the least. While China builds railways and roads quite literally from one end of the nation to the other, and while China and its Southeast Asian neighbors help it construct dams to utilize its many rivers and mountainous terrain, the US has constructed instead <a href="http://journal-neo.org/2016/02/01/laos-the-new-cold-war-battleground-you-dont-know-about/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an army of faux-NGOs dedicated to obstructing these infrastructure projects</a> based on “human rights” and “environmental” concerns.</p>
<p>When President Obama and his entourage arrive in Laos, they will see joint Lao-Thai-Sino infrastructure and construction projects punctuating the increasingly modern and well-developed capital city of Vientiane. Chinese and Thai brands also are represented, as is a clear socioeconomic influence from neighboring Vietnam.</p>
<p>In contrast, President Obama’s entourage will also see SUVs with Western-funded NGO logos on their sides, racing around the city, posting up banners encouraging the Laotian people to use less electricity and resources in an effort to reduce demand for modernization and development and the joint infrastructure projects led by China and Thailand to address this demand.</p>
<p><strong>What the US Lacks in Substance, It Makes Up for in “Soft Power” Coercion</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Between both China and Thailand’s proximity and cultural ties to Laos – with Laotian and Thai languages being closely related and even discernible by both peoples – as well as their substantive and tangible contributions to Laos’ development as a modern nation-state, the United States’ policy of asserting geopolitical primacy over Asia, including Loas, its people, and its resources stand little chance of attracting widespread support from leadership in Vientiane.</p>
<p>However, what the US lacks in geopolitical substance, it can make up for with “soft power” geopolitical coercion. Part of the responsibilities of faux-NGOs operating within Laos is to apply pressure on the government to make unsound policy decisions favoring US interests at the expense of both Laos’ and Asia’s regionally.</p>
<p>President Obama’s participation in the YSEALI summit is part of this – indoctrinating young Asians, including those from Laos – to integrate themselves into the networks and institutions serving Western interests rather than those of Laos and Asia. Upon completion of the YSEALI’s programs, these young people will find themselves as part of America’s growing networks across Asia, opposing development in Laos, hampering constructive ties with Laos’ neighbors, and instead, favoring and promoting policies including the implementation of the TPP, “open markets,” US-ASEAN military integration, and other compromising policies that serve Washington’s interests at the expense of Laos, its sovereignty, development, and its future.</p>
<p>As awareness grows regarding the true nature of US “soft power” and the role it plays in coercing nations behind the scenes, its effectiveness will likely wane. With no alternatives able to compete with the current level of investment and engagement Laos’ immediate regional neighbors have committed, the US faces the prospect of <a href="http://journal-neo.org/2016/06/10/us-declares-hegemony-over-asia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">its “primacy” in Asia</a> being further undermined. Then again, for a North American nation to declare “primacy” over Asia to begin with is somewhat problematic and an issue the whole of Asia needs to address more openly and directly.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong class="date">September 5th, 2016</strong> by Judicial Watch</p>

			<p><em><a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-new-abedin-emails-reveal-top-clinton-foundation-executive-doug-band-sought-diplomatic-passport-clinton-state-department/">Judicial Watch</a> today released <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/tag/huma-production-11/">510 pages</a> of new State Department documents, including a 2009 request by Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band for diplomatic passports for himself and an associate.  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s aide Abedin responded to Band’s request positively, saying, “Ok will figure it out.”  The emails show Hillary Clinton forwarding classified information to Abedin’s unsecured, non-state.gov account. The emails also show Bill Clinton sought a meeting with Mrs. Clinton for a major Clinton donor with State Department officials and Hillary Clinton herself pushed for a joint event with the Clinton Global Initiative.  Band also pushed for and obtained special help from Abedin for seven-figure Clinton Foundation donor Chris Ruddy, of Newsmax.com.</em></p>
<p>Although an exchange sent from Sidney Blumenthal to Hillary Clinton concerning the “disastrous nature of the Obama trip” and the U.S. being “totally out of the loop in Berlin – no ambassador” with the expectation that “Germans and Russians will now cut their own separate deals on energy, regional security, etc….” had previously published by the State Department, it was unknown until now that Clinton forwarded this exchange containing <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-production-11-00684-pg-127-128/">classified information</a> that was redacted for security reasons to Abedin’s unsecure non-state.gov account</p>
<p>The new documents included <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-huma-emails-production-11-unpublished-00684/">37 Hillary Clinton email exchanges</a> not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date of such emails uncovered by Judicial Watch to 228 of new Clinton emails (not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department).  These records further appear to contradict statements by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails were turned over to the State Department.</p>
<p>The Band request was for a special diplomatic passport for himself and his associates – an unidentified “JD” and apparently Justin Cooper, formerly a key member of Bill Clinton’s personal office and the Clinton Foundation who has been linked to registration documents for and the shutting down of the email server at the center of Mrs. Clinton’s State Department emails controversy.</p>
<p>The Band-Abedin exchange went as follows:</p>

<p>The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations strictly limits the granting of diplomatic passports to members of the Foreign Service, their family members, or those working on U.S. government contracts. According to 22 CFR 51.3:</p>
<blockquote><p>A diplomatic passport is issued to a Foreign Service officer or to a person having diplomatic status or comparable status because he or she is traveling abroad to carry out diplomatic duties on behalf of the U.S. Government. When authorized by the Department, spouses and family members of such persons may be issued diplomatic passports. When authorized by the Department, a diplomatic passport may be issued to a U.S. Government contractor if the contractor meets the eligibility requirements for a diplomatic passport and the diplomatic passport is necessary to complete his or her mission.</p></blockquote>
<p>The newly released Abedin emails also contain additional instances of the Clinton State Department’s granting special favors to major contributors to the Clinton Foundation. A <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-production-11-00684-pg-31/">July 27, 2009</a>, exchange of emails begins with Abedin advising Clinton scheduler Lona Valmoro that “wjc” (William Jefferson Clinton) wants special treatment for high-dollar Foundation donor and Dow Chemical’s CEO Andrew Liveris. Dow donated between<a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%241%2C000%2C001%20to%20%245%2C000%2C000&amp;page=2"> $1 million and $5 million</a> to the Clinton Foundation, making it one of the largest corporate donors in Foundation history.</p>

<p>The Abedin emails include a mid-August 2009, email exchange in which Band urges Abedin to follow up on a request from Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy to set up a meeting with then-Ambassador to Panama Barbara Stephenson on behalf of lobbyist <a href="http://www.ottoreich.com/Biography.html">Amb. Otto Reich</a>, President Reagan’s ambassador to Venezuela who maintained high-level government positions during the tenure of both President George H.W. Bush and President George Bush.  In early September, Ruddy then was contacted by State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Roberta S. Jacobson, at the behest of Band and Abedin, in reference to Ruddy’s concerns about Wilson Lucom, whose estate was embroiled in a heated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/03/wilson-lucom-panama-court-ruling">multi-million-dollar lawsuit</a>.  Ruddy’s Newsmax Media Inc, made a contribution to the Clinton Foundation of between <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%241%2C000%2C001%20to%20%245%2C000%2C000&amp;page=1">$1 million and $5 million</a>. The emails show the responsible official was put in contact with Ruddy.</p>

<p>She’s the dep assistant secretary for the whole bureau.</p>
<p>The Panama desk guy is on leave so I asked that she at least reach out.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Newsmax publishes a regular Judicial Watch column.)</p>
<p>The new Abedin emails also include an email exchange between Sidney Blumenthal and the then-Secretary of State in which Blumenthal proposes a<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-production-11-00684-pg-170-171/">Clinton Global Initiative meeting</a> in Ireland. Hillary Clinton forwarded Blumenthal’s email to Abedin, Cheryl Mills, and Doug Band saying, “I think this is a good idea and see no conflict.” Band then responded that he and Bill Clinton think it is as “great idea.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-uncovers-new-batch-hillary-clinton-emails/">Again</a>, Hillary Clinton’s involvement in CGI violates her ethics pledge to stay of out of Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative business.  Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton on January 5, 2009, in a <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hillary-R-Clinton-Termination-EA.pdf">letter</a> to State Department Designated Agency Ethics Official James H. Thessin:</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the duration of my appointment as Secretary if I am confirmed, I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which The William J. Clinton Foundation (or the Clinton Global Initiative) is a party or represents a party….”</p></blockquote>
<p>In an email exchange in late <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-production-11-00684-pg-315/">August 2009</a>, billionaire businesswoman Lynn Forester de Rothschild intervened directly with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to set up a <em>Parade </em>magazine interview for journalist Les Gelb, assuring Clinton, “He said he would give you a veto over content and looked me in the eye and said, ‘she will like it.’” Abedin then instructed State Department aide Phillip Reines. Reines acquiesced responding, “Yes, we’re trying to find a date that works for Les, but he is a little, shall we say, picky.” Rothschild is a longtime Clinton Foundation <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/search/node/rothschild">supporter</a> who in mid-May of this year held a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/05/13/hillary-clinton-hosts-100000-a-head-fundraisers/">$100,000-a-plate fundraiser</a> for the presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Also in the documents is an <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-production-11-00684-pg-351/">August 2009</a> communication from Hillary Clinton to her aides Abedin and Lauren Jiloty asking for the phone numbers of<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/bulletins/teneo-the-clinton-machine/">Declan Kelly</a>, Clinton’s former economic envoy to Northern Ireland who is co-founder and CEO of Teneo.</p>
<p>“The idea that the State Department would even consider a diplomatic passport for Clinton Foundation executives is beyond belief,” stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  “These emails show various violations of national security laws and ethics rules and further confirm that Hillary and Bill Clinton are personally implicated in the Clinton Foundation pay to play scandal.”</p>
<p>This is the eleventh set of records produced for Judicial Watch by the State Department from the non-state.gov email accounts of Huma Abedin.  The documents were produced under a <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-jan-11-order-00684/">court order</a> in a May 5, 2015, Freedom of Information (FOIA) <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-files-seven-new-foia-lawsuits-against-state-department-to-force-release-of-clinton-emails-other-secret-email-records/">lawsuit</a> against the State Department (<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-00684-abedin-non-state-emails/"><em>Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State</em></a> (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) requiring the agency to produce “all emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013, using a ‘non-state’.gov email address.”</p>
<p>On August 22, Judicial Watch released <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/new-abedin-emails-reveal-hillary-clinton-state-department-gave-special-access-top-clinton-foundation-donors/">725 pages</a> of new State Department documents, including previously unreleased email exchanges in which Hillary Clinton top aide Huma Abedin provided influential Clinton Foundation donors special, expedited access to the secretary of state. In many instances, the preferential treatment provided to donors was at the specific request of Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band.</p>
