As for our own competition, we gave you the opportunity to predict the outcome of the final match. Both the teams and the final score had to be predicted in order to win a Lifetime Ultimate Bucket account. We had about 1000 participants who entered the competition. About 1%, eight participants, predicted a final between Germany and Argentina.
Eight participants were still in the race to win our stunning price. As for those, eight participants, four of them predicted Germany as a winner. Sadly none, predicted the final score of 1-0, which leaves our final undecided.
Therefore, we decided to give the four participants that predicted the teams right and Germany as the winner, one month free use of UsenetBucket of their most valuable Bucket. All the winners have been contacted.
We had a lot of fun, we hope you did as well. Hopefully next time, we will be able to grant our amazing price!
