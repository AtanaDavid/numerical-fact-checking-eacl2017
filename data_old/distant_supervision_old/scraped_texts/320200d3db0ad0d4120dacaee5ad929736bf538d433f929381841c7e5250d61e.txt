A few years ago the queues outside the bookmakers would stretch down the high street on the day of the Grand National. Thankfully, today we can take the hassle out of backing a horse by doing it online. Bookmakers websites are quick to join, easy to navigate and safe to use.
The bookmakers we list are licensed, regulated and have 24 hour customer support. We know you can trust these guys, because we regularly use them to place our bets.
You might ask ‘Who is the best bookmaker?‘ Well, it all depends on what type of bet you want to place, the size of bet and other considerations like what Free Bet deals are being offered.
For the average Grand National punter, a bookmaker like Betfair is going to be your best bet. Firstly their website is easy to use, joining only takes a minute and you can use all major UK debit and credit cards and Paypal to fund your bets.
Secondly, and possibly the biggest reason to bet with Betfair for the Grand National, is that they payout on the first 5 horses for each-way bets when most other bookmakers only payout on the first 4 horses home. So your each-way bet with Betfair has one more chance to win!
Thirdly, Betfair always offers a free bet deal on the day of the National. Other bookmakers withdraw theirs – the swines!
