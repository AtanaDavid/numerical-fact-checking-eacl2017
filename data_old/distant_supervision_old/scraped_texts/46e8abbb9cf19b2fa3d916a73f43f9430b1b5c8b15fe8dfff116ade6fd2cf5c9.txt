It is a 5km run - it's you against the clock.
It's run in Crystal Palace Park. See Course page for more details.
Nothing - it's free! but please register before your first run. Only ever register with parkrun once. Don't forget to bring a printed copy of your barcode (request a reminder). If you forget it, you won't get a time.
We all run for our own enjoyment. Please come along and join in whatever your pace!
It is entirely organised by volunteers - email CrystalPalacehelpers@parkrun.com to help.
Every week we grab a post parkrun coffee at the Crystal Palace Park Cafe - please come and join us.
