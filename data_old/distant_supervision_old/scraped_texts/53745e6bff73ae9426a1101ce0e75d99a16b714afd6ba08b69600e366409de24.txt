The 2014–15 Detroit Waza season was the seventh season of the Detroit Waza professional indoor soccer club, also known as Detroit Waza Flo Pro FC. The Waza, an Eastern Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, played their home games at the Melvindale Civic Center in the Detroit suburb of Melvindale, Michigan.
The team was led by team owner Mario Scicluna, head coach Costea Decu, and assistant coach Mirco Gubellini. The team struggled to a 4-16 record, placing fourth in the five-team Eastern Division, and did not qualify for post-season play.
Detroit opened the season with a home win over the Harrisburg Heat, dropped games to the Rochester Lancers and Baltimore Blast, then defeated Harrisburg on the road. After two more losses, the Waza beat the Syracuse Silver Knights then started an eight-game losing streak, broken only by a third victory over Harrisburg. They closed the season with a roster diminished by trades at the deadline and lost their last four games. With their 4–16 record, Detroit placed fourth in the Eastern Division (ahead of only Harrisburg) and did not qualify for the playoffs.
The Waza were a charter member of the Professional Arena Soccer League and the only PASL team to operate continuously from the league's 2008 debut through its 2014 rebranding. The franchise struggled in its first three seasons, posting 7–9, 6–10, and 8–8 records. In 2011–12, the team went 13–3 and won the Eastern Division but lost the Ron Newman Cup Finals. In 2012–13, the Waza improved to 14–2 and again won the Eastern Division only to lose again in the Finals. 2013–14 saw a slip to 10–5, second place in the Eastern Division, and an early exit from the playoffs.
