RIO DE JANEIRO — If the women’s marathon has you confused, perhaps wondering about the functionality of your TV set, do not be alarmed: Yes, there are three identical Estonians running the race.
They are triplets: Leila, Lily and Liina Luik, 30, will be participating in the marathon, completing a trifecta never before seen in Olympic history. There have been many twins at the Games, but never triplets, let alone triplets competing simultaneously in the same event.
Spectators, officials and TV announcers alike “don’t know who is who,” Lily said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Commentators see one of us is coming, and the other is a little bit later, and then comes the third one. It's like: ‘So fast, you are already here.’”
The sisters, who call themselves the “Trio to Rio,” push each other during events, Lily added. “If one of us has a bad competition or something, everyone feels that.”
Said Leila: “When its hard conditions and someone is little bit behind or weaker, we all push each other — 'Go, go on, come on, don't stop.’ Together we are like a dream team.”
Despite three chances to medal, don’t expect a Luik on the podium. While Leila owns the best time, at just over 2 hours and 37 minutes, that time is nearly 15 minutes behind the Olympic record.
The race, which is held on Sunday, is expected to be dominated by runners from Kenya and Ethiopia, who own eight of the world’s best times in 2016.
