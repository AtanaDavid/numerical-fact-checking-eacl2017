The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for Exxon Mobil is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 5 years.
See our documentation to learn about this calculation.
Present value of next 5 years cash flows:$60,257
Terminal Value = FCF2020 × (1 + g) ÷ (Discount Rate – g)
Terminal Value = $14,095 × (1 + 1.8%) ÷ (8.35% – 1.8%)
Terminal value based on the Perpetuity Method where growth (g) = 1.8%:
$217,305
Equity Value (Total value) = Present value of next 5 years cash flows + terminal value
Value = Total value / Shares Outstanding ($205,778 / 4,089)
Current discount (share price of $86.49): -72%
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 8.35% = 1.75% + (0.8 * 8.25%)
The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
0.604 = 0.553 (1 + (1- 30%) (13.05%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 0.8
