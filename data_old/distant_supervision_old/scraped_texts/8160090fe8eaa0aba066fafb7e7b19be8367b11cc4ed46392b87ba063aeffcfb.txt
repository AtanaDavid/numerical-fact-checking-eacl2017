The merger of team from the Major Indoor Soccer League and the Professional Arena Soccer League has resulted in a new league dubbed the Major Arena Soccer League, or MASL.
The 24-team league will include franchises in many cities in both the United States and in Mexico including Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles (Inland Empire), Monterrey and San Diego, among others.
