<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Big League Soccer Returns to the United States</H3>
<P>As described in the 1966 summaries, the debut of major league soccer in 1967 was a sloppy one, caused by the inability of the major soccer organizers to reach an agreement on a single league. As a result, two leagues made their debut in 1967, the United Soccer Association, which had the sanction of FIFA, and the National Professional Soccer League, which did not, Branded an "outlaw" league by FIFA, players faced sanctions for nigning with the NPSL. The NPSL did, however, have a TV contract with CBS, and a slight head start in organizing its teams, as well as an earlier start date. </P>
<P>The modern era of professional soccer in the United States began on April 16 in Baltimore, where Atlanta Chiefs met the hometown Bays, to kick off the National Professional Soccer League season. The attendance for the match was 8,434, not exactly the throng which had been anticipated. CBS televised the opener, and viewers saw a bitter defensive struggle which Baltimore won, 1-0. The NPSL had adopted a novel scoring system of six points for a win, three points for a tie, and-in an effort to increase offense, as it was feared that American fans would not appreciate low-scoring games, not matter how well played-one point for each goal scored, up to a maximum of three per match. As a result, Baltimore tallied seven points in the standings, while Atlanta earned none. Purists decried the scoring system; however, such a scheme of extra points for goal-scoring had been suggested years earlier by Arthur Drewry, then president of England’s Football Association and a future president of FIFA, with the idea being rejected by the English clubs. Some individuals welcomed the NPSL’s attempt to encourage offensive-style soccer during an era that was dominated by defensive-style systems like Italy’s Catenaccio, which featured seven defenders. &quot;Now it has taken the NPSL, starting from scratch and hoping to sell football as an all-action, exciting, positive spectacle, to tread the path&quot; with the new scoring system, wrote a leading British writer. Ultimately, the new scoring system would do little to increase offensive production, and would lead to embarrassing results in ensuing years.</P>
<P>&quot;Just for kicks!&quot; was CBS’ marketing slogan for its NPSL game of the week, which was broadcast live and in color on Sundays. Manning the microphones for CBS was Jack Whitaker, one of the country’s most respected play-by-play men. Color commentary was supplied by Danny Blanchflower, the former Northern Irish soccer star. To the delight of many and the chagrin of the owners, Blanchflower interpreted the games as he saw them: he was not particularly impressed by the standard of play, and he was brutally frank in his assessments.</P>
<P>Throughout the NPSL, crowds and TV ratings dwindled. St. Louis sold 38,000 tickets to its season opener, but cold, rainy weather limited the crowd to 20,985; the spoiled and discriminating fans in that city, long America’s amateur soccer capital, soon turned their backs on the club. By the summer, the NPSL was on its way to a league-wide average gate of 4,879. St. Louis would be its top drawer, with a 7,613 average.</P>
<P>While the style of play was erratic in the NPSL, the league was not without some talented and smart players: Warren Archibald (New York), player-coach Phil Woosnam (Atlanta), Co Prins (Pittsburgh), Yanko Daucik (Toronto), Art Welch (Baltimore), John Best (Philadelphia), Mirko Stojanovic (Oakland), Vic Crowe (Atlanta), Ron Newman (Atlanta), Gabbo Gavric (Oakland), and Ilija Mitic (Oakland). All but Prins and Daucik would make their mark on American soccer in the years that followed, as players, coaches, and managers.</P>
<P>Although an &quot;American&quot; league, few citizens dotted the NPSL’s rosters. Only eight American citizens played in 1967, but some managed to have an impact on the circuit. Chicago Spurs’ Willy Roy-who was born in Germany but moved to the U.S. at six-was the league’s second leading scorer with 17 goals and 5 assists. Walt Chyzowich-Ukrainian born but who attended Roman Catholic High School and Temple University in Philadelphia-jumped from the ASL to become player-personnel director for Philadelphia Spartans. Out of the eight citizens in the league, only three were native: Joe Speca (Baltimore), and St. Louis featured a trio of collegiate stars: Carl Schwarzen, Carl Gentile, and Pat McBride.</P>
<P>As if the oft-criticized point system wasn’t enough, the NPSL also lost substantial credibility as a result of, ironically, its television contract: on May 15, barely one month into the season, referee Peter Rhodes admitted that eleven of the 21 fouls he called in the televised Toronto-Pittsburgh match were to allow CBS to work in commercials-the first &quot;official&quot; time outs in the sport’s long history. On one occasion, Rhodes had to push one player down who was trying to get up and resume the game because the commercial hadn’t finished.</P>
<P>It was in this atmosphere of snickers and rolled eyeballs that the United Soccer Association (USA) began play on May 28. Its owners were confident of success, since it had imported what it would tell the public were twelve of the best teams in the world. In fact, they were a mixed breed: many of the world’s best teams, like Santos of Brazil, often play year-round schedules, and were simply unavailable. Out of the teams that did make the trip, Wolverhampton of England, representing Los Angeles Wolves, proved to be the elite of the league, along with Washington Whips (Aberdeen of Scotland) and Cleveland Stokers (Stoke City of England, featuring the incomparable goalkeeper Gordon Banks). Other cities were represented by lesser sides, such as Dundee United of Scotland (Dallas Tornado), Cerro of Uruguay (New York Skyliners), Bangu of Brazil (the 1960 ISL Champions, now representing Houston Stars), ADO Den Hague of Holland (San Francisco Golden Gate Gales), and Glentoran of Belfast (Detroit Cougars). Rounding out the field were Sunderland of England (Vancouver Royal Canadians), Cagliari of Italy (Chicago Mustangs), Shamrock Rovers (Boston Rovers), and Hibernian of Scotland (Toronto City). Each USA franchise paid about $250,000 to import its &quot;team&quot;; the pairings were made after the USA contracted with each foreign club to spend the summer in America, and then assigned to each city based upon, primarily, that particular city’s ethnic makeup. New York was somewhat randomly stuck with a Uruguayan team even though there is no sizable Uruguayan presence in the Big Apple, because it was assumed New Yorkers would come out for soccer regardless of where the team came from.</P>
<P>With a shorter season, a series of exhibition games which whetted fans’ appetites, and more lead time, the USA got off to a better start. Among the opening crowds were 34,965 in Houston’s Astrodome, 21,871 in Yankee Stadium, and 16,431 in Dallas’ Cotton Bowl; no opener drew less than 7,400. Of course, subsequent crowds didn’t keep pace, and the league finished with an average of 7,890 per game. Houston paced the circuit with its 19,802 average, while Boston brought up the rear at 4,171.</P>
<P>As both leagues’ seasons progressed, it was apparent that while clubs in both organizations had spent lots of money, very little of it appeared to be directed towards procuring quality footballers. As the season progressed, owners in both leagues surmised that team rosters dominated by foreign players of questionable skill were not going to lure fans into the stadiums. Accordingly, some teams announced grand schemes to &quot;Americanize&quot; the game: for example, Chicago Mustangs of the USA announced that its 1968 roster would be exclusively American. In the interim, NPSL and USA clubs resorted to gimmickry to attract supporters: Baltimore ushered in cheerleaders, roving jazz combos, and half-time marching bands. Other clubs offered numerous &quot;giveaway&quot; days. Few fans seemed to notice or care.</P>
<P>In spite of the problems on and off the field, both leagues came down to high quality finishes. The USA went into its playoffs first, in the second week of July. Los Angeles Wolves, by the flip of a coin, won the right to host the championship game against Eastern Division champion Washington Whips. The match drew 17,824 to Memorial Stadium, and they had the privilege of viewing one of the most exciting games in U.S. soccer history: after 36 minutes of overtime, Los Angeles won the championship, 6-5, when Washington defender Ally Shewan accidentally nudges a long Wolves pass into his own net. Four goals were scored within 3½ minutes midway through the second half, and each scored during the overtime.</P>
<P>In the NPSL, Oakland prevailed over Baltimore in a two-game, total-goals series in September. Dennis Viollet’s tally gave Baltimore a 1-0 win before a home crowd of 16,619, but in the second leg at Oakland Coliseum Dragan Djukic scored a hat-trick as the Clippers won 4-1 before 9,037.</P>
<P>Yanko Daucik of Toronto led the NPSL in scoring with 20 goals and 8 assists, and The Sporting News named Philadelphia defender Ruben &quot;The Hatchet&quot; Navarro the circuit’s Most Valuable Player. Willy Roy’s goal scoring netted him the Rookie of the Year award. Chicago (Cagliari)’s Roberto Boninsegna was the USA’s top scorer with 10 goals and one assist in only nine games. A major source for this 1967 review is Zander Hollander's book "The Encyclopedia of American Soccer. Published in 1980, it is sadly now out of print.</P>

<P></A>In the American Soccer League, where a winter schedule was still being played, it was business as usual: teams disbanded before the completion of then season, and full schedules were not completed. With the addition of Baltimore St. Gerard’s, the league expanded to a two-division format for the first time since 1938-39. Although the league was now back up to 12 teams, the league continued to live in the past and wasn't well equipped to handle the future. For now, the league continued on small budgets, in eastern seabord cities, with ethnic followings playing on small fields with part-time players and small crowds.</P>
<P>In the middle of all the chaos, Baltimore took the South Division and the ASL title, defeating North Division winners Newark Sitch in the championship match, 4-3. Eugene Chyzowich-Walt’s brother-was named Coach of the Year for his job with Newark Sitch, while Marko Worobec of Newark was named MVP.</P>

<P>A major change in standings came to pass as New York Ukrainians took the top honors in a close season race, with new York Hota close behind much of the season.  Greek-Americans and Hellenic SC tied for 4th.  The GASL, already steadily being oversheadowed by the ASL, not faded even further as the new USA and NPSL pro leagues took the lions share of attention.  This would begin a trend towards greater obscurity for the amateur leagues of the region, once such a key part of the seasonal soccer activity.</P>

<P>Schwaben climbed back to a familiar position as they reclaimed the championship of the league for the first time since their four year dynasty in the late 50's.  Green/White (Blau-Weiss Gotschee) tied them in the regular standings with kickers right behind.  Once again, it was a close and exciting race.  As in New York, the NSL was suddenly faced with professional competition with both of the new pro leagues fielding clubs in the city.  Although the league continues even into the 21st century, it was just now entering into an obscurity from which it likely will not recover.  This was also apparently the last year the NSL held it's long-running indoor season.</P>

<P></A>The USSF breathed a sigh of relief when the warring USA and NPSL, facing bankruptcy declared peace and merged to form the North American Soccer League.  The USSF had been facing sanctions by FIFA over the NPSL's outlaw status, a situation they could do little about.</P>
<P>On the Olympic front, the US for once did not have to face Mexico, who qualified automatically as host country.  The US had only to play Bermuda in the preliminary round.  The team, effectively co-coached by manager Walter Giesler and coach Geza Henni, was turbulent.  Henni was in effective control, but did not have the time or resources to prepare the team on a serious basis.  The players came primarily from the East and Chicago, and included such future names as Werner Fricker, Rudy Getzinger and Bob Gansler.  </P>
<P>The team, again assembled at the last minute, managed a 1-1 draw at Bermuda.  They reassembled a week later in Chicago, and gave away the game in the 28th minute, when goalie Mike Ivanow did not call his teammates to make a protective wall on what he thought was an indirect free kick, allowing Gladwys Daniels to score.  Bermuda held on to win 1-0, eliminating the US from further competition.  A grave disappointment, considering the easy competition the team faced.  Ultimately, Hungary took the gold, Bulgaria took the silver and Japan took the Bronze.</P>
