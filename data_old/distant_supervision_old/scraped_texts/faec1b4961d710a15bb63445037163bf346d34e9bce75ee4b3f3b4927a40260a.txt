Lou Graham defeated John Mahaffey in an 18-hole playoff to win the 1975 U.S. Open a day after the third-round leader collapsed and several notable players failed to take advantage.
Frank Beard was that third-round leader. He was four strokes ahead of Graham and six ahead of Mahaffey at the start of the final round. But Beard shot 78 in Round 4, including bogeys on Nos. 16 and 17.
Mahaffey parred in after a long birdie putt at No. 14, shooting 71 and posting 287. Bob Murphy could have tied, but bogied the last hole and tied for third. Ben Crenshaw put a ball in the water on the 17th hole, and he tied Murphy. Defending champion Hale Irwin shot 70, but fell a stroke short of the playoff. Peter Oosterhuis (75-289), Jack Nicklaus (72-289) and Arnold Palmer (73-290) are others who missed opportunities.
Graham had the chance to win it in regulation, but bogied the 72nd hole. In the Monday playoff, however, Graham bettered Mahaffey 71 to 73.
