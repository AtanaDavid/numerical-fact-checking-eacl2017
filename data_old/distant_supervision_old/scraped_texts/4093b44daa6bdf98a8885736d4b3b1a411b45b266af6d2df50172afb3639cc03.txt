Sam Querrey has beaten world number one Novak Djokovic in the third round of Wimbledon, recording a 7-6 6-1 3-6 7-6 victory over the defending champion.
It is the first time in nine years that Djokovic has failed to make at least the quarter-finals of the Grand Slam in London, and indeed the first time since 2009 that he has failed to reach at least the fourth round of a major competition.
The world number one was attempting to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Grand Slams in the same year, but Querrey came through the rain-soaked match in the capital.
It was Querrey that took the opening set 7-6 following a tie-break, before the American claimed the second set 6-1 after breaking Djokovic's serve on two occasions at 1-2 and 1-4.
Djokovic responded in the third set, breaking the 28-year-old's first two serves on his way to taking a 4-0 lead and he eventually closed it out 6-3 to force a fourth set.
The two players exchanged breaks of serve in the latter stages of the fourth, but the set once again headed for a tie-break and it was Querrey that came through 7-5 to shock the competition in the third round.
