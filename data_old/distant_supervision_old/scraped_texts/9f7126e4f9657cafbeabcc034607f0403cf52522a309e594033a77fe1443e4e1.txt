The Group AGM will be held at Blundellsands Tennis Club at 8 pm on the 3rd November. Agenda and papers will be sent to Clubs immediately after our Committee meeting on the 18th October.
We will be trialling sending the paperwork by email as this has been requested by Clubs on a number of occasions. Previously, sending items by email has met with mixed success as when we ask for return confirmation we generally only get about 20 responses (from 25) and are never sure that the email has been received by all Clubs.
Could you please ensure that your contact email in the Group Handbook is live and monitored as this will be a great help. Â The email will also ask for return confirmation so please take a moment to reply.
We look forward to seeing you at the AGM
