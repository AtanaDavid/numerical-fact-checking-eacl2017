Working hard and playing hard is pretty much a mantra around these parts. Check out the serious fun the Burning River Roller Girls are having, practicing for over a year before their Maiden Massacre roller derby debut this week. Or watch the vid of Cleveland Orchestra’s Joshua Smith, who put together a stellar music program to accompany the out-of-this-world Monet In Normandy exhibit right in the gallery at CMA. Read Cool Cleveland Kids and find out who’s taking the arts to the little ones. Columnist Mansfield Frazier is serious about creating a “Hate-Free Cleveland,” and Roldo spots a flagrant bias in our mainstream media. A city can’t have fun while it coddles the rich and hates people of color. BioE’s Baiju Shah makes a big announcement via our podcast below, and we profile author/entrepreneur Ron Finklestein. Our questions about the whispering campaign for a Medical Mart, posted to BrewedFreshDaily, has generated 52+ comments, and we link you over so you can add yours. As long as you’re willing to work hard, we can have a lot of fun around here. Thomas Mulready
Cristi Cantle Burning River Roller Girls
Cristi Cantle aka Skellawhore, (they all have nicknames, as it turns out), manages to be fierce, polite, aggressive, business-like and fun-loving, all in the same breath, just like most of her teammates. She’s been practicing three times a week for over a year with 60 other young NEO women to form the Burning River Roller Girls roller derby league, wherein four teams (The Rolling Pinups, the Hellbombers, the Hard Knockers, and the Cleveland Steamers) play each other at the North Olmsted Soccer Sportsplex once a month starting with their Maiden Massacre on Sun 4/22 from 3-7PM. Cool Cleveland’s Thomas Mulready spoke with Cristi at one of their practices about their girl power leanings, their super-secret outfits, the suicide seating at the edge of the rink and their kickin’ after-parties at the Garage Bar. http://www.BurningRiverRollerGirls.com
Joshua Smith Principal Flutist, Cleveland Orchestra
Joshua Smith has been Principal Flutist of the world-class Cleveland Orchestra for 17 years, since he was 20 years old. Cool Cleveland’s Thomas Mulready hooked up with Joshua on the steps of Severance Hall prior to a rehearsal for the program he put together with Massoud Saidpour of the Cleveland Museum of Art to play thematically related music in the galleries during the awesome Monet In Normandy exhibition. Those performances continue Wed 4/25 and Fri 5/4 with more info here. They talked about what it’s like living in the city and riding your bike to work at University Circle, as well as how he found his vintage flute on the Internet. Joshua is featured heavily in the Orchestra’s new DVD of Bruckner’s 5th Symphony, and his flute playing can be heard at Severance in the upcoming Spring Festival featuring Der Rosenkavalier, as well as in Daphnis & Chloe at Blosson this summer. http://www.SoloFlute.com http://www.ClevelandOrchestra.com
Taking the Arts to Where the Kids Are
But all the effort is worth it. Its the first Thursday of the month  Kids Club day at Great Northern  a day when more than 50 kids and parents gather in the malls center to be entertained by a team of music therapists from The Beck Center for the Arts. For the moms, its quite likely just a temporary diversion, an activity that gets them out of the house and their cabin-feverish kids out to burn some energy. But for the kids, activities like this one could become the foundation for a lifelong love of the arts…

Actor Bob Snider R.I.P. The self-styled “Clark Gable look-alike and Edward Arnold wannabe” was 78 when he passed on 4/16 after a bout with cancer. Many of us will remember Bob as an actor and proud AEA member who worked at so many theatres in Cleveland over the decades — Greenbrier, Huntington, John Carroll, Beck, Carousel, Cleveland Public Theatre, and more. Snider was also CPT’s long-time Box Office Manager from 1986-2004, greeting patrons and artists and selling tickets for hundreds of productions, including the Performance Art Festival. His jovial presence became a CPT institution. Arrangements are being made by Chambers Funeral Home on Rocky River Drive. The burial is Thu 4/19, 1 PM, at Sunset Cemetery off Columbia Road. CPT is holding a memorial service for Bob on Sat 4/21, 2-6 PM at CPT. Testimonials, photos, and videos of productions will be shared. Please come and share your stories and memories of Bob. He will be greatly missed. From Cool Cleveland contributor Linda Eisenstein lindaATcoolcleveland.com

Its Time for a Hate-Free Cleveland
Its a crime that we are promoting these kinds of messages. The whole gangsta rap industry is drug driven, race-driven and greed-driven… its not healthy for our children. – A quote from C. Delores Tucker (1924-2005) the activist who bought stock in Sony and Time Warner, which allowed her to speak out at stockholders meetings.
Former shock jock Don Imus  who was rightfully rode off of the airways on a rail, tarred and feathered with his own bigotry, and hung by his own foul tongue  engaged in a vicious form of hate speech on his nationally syndicated radio talk show and did the country a great service. His hateful, racist and misogynistic (and now very rueful) comments afforded us the opportunity to begin to at last seriously engage in a national dialogue about the most troubling issue facing America: Race. And since Imus virtually got his start here in Cleveland, maybe we can take the lead in attempting to insure that our children and grandchildren are left a country with some remaining sense of morality and probity. More on what we in Cleveland can do here in just a moment…
*************** SPONSORED LINK ***************Coming Attractions: A Region Unveiled The challenge set before the Greater Cleveland Marketing Alliance (GMCA) was a big one: Develop an umbrella campaign that would translate across several distinct audiences and be easily institutionalized throughout the region. Could it be done? Keep in mind that the target audiences for this campaign are distinct and varied  leisure travelers, meeting planners, business investment decision makers and site selectors and the regions residents. And the ultimate brand and campaign should not only inspire people to re-think their perceptions of the region, but also engage regional organizations so they want to use the campaign and take action, such as driving visitors to travelcleveland.com or attract new convention business. On Thu 4/26 the GMCA will unveil the brand and campaign that will help us redefine our region. Stay tuned. To learn more visit www.gcpartnership.com.*************** SPONSORED LINK ***************
Its really amazing and amazingly appropriate for OperaCleveland to have such a young executive director (hes 37) for this new company, but whats even more so is all the experience he has accrued in the various areas needed for his position. Hes been on-stage, back-stage and off-stage (but behind the scenes) for most of the last 25 years or so in some capacity or another. Hes been a dancer, singer, choreographer, lighting tech, costume designer, director, fund-raiser, schmoozer, educator and myriad other behind-the-scenes but necessary entities for an arts company, sometimes doing more than one of these functions at a time…

Cool Cleveland: Your adage is “Attitude is Everything.” How did it come to be your mantra?
Ron Finklestein: Attitude really is everything and I became aware of that in 2001 when I lost my job. I spent a year trying to figure out what was going on. I was ready to leave the area and go where the jobs were. My son Aaron was a senior in high school. The impact on him wasn’t as great as it was on my daughter Emily who was a sophomore at the time.  I had a discussion with my daughter and I suggested that she stay here with her mother and then after graduating, we’d be together again or she’d be on her way to to college. During our conversation she said something that literally changed my life. She said, “I don’t want to be away from you for two years.” At that point I made three decisions. The first was that my problems were not my children’s problems and I was foolish for subjecting them to such stress-it will never happen again. The second was that my skills are good and there’s no reason I need to be unemployed, so I immediately started my company and hired myself. The third decision was that I would do something about the job situation in my hometown. I was tired of seeing my friends and family leave the region due to limited job opportunities…

PD Bias Flagrant in Abatement Editorial
It took the Plain Dealer mere hours to slam Mayor Frank Jacksons compromise offer on the overly generous 15 year, 100 percent residential tax abatements.
Its the fastest the lethargic Pee Dee has moved in years.
The 15-year, 100 percent abatement policy is before City Council for renewal or alteration in the next couple of months.
Any time the PD can support an elite, establishment policy, the Monopoly Mouth is there in a sprint.
The editorial says that the CSU study was paid for by the city. Not true. One has to wonder why the editorial made such a mistake…
National Library Week Reflections on the Cleveland Public Library
The Cleveland Public Library downtown is a gem. If it were a real gem it could be a diamond because of its longevity and faithfulness to its mission.  Or it could be a ruby because of its energetic enthusiasm. Its a place where anyone can go and smell, touch, open, and read books, and even take them home. It opens up the world to the people of our community that come together in Cleveland from diverse cultures and can read newspapers in their native tongue. The library hopes to encourage a love of reading, pursuit of knowledge, and enhance the quality of life of those it serves.
Soon, the Eastman Reading Garden will open! This gated city garden, sandwiched between the historic 1925 building and the Louis Stokes Wing completed in 1997, is the best place to sit and read in the summer.  When the sculptured metal and bronze gates at the north and south entrances of the Eastman Reading Garden open, were welcome to sit on the benches or in the comfortable wire chairs, in the shade or in the dappled sun.  Nothing evokes quiet repose like the tree-filled sanctuary in the city gentled by the soothing sound of flowing water.
When the garden was renovated in the late 20th century, sculptor Maya Lin created the sculpture called Reading a Garden, which features an L-shaped granite fountain with glasslike water floating on top then flowing down the sides and an abstract poem carved into the fountain with raised letters.  Take the time to soak in the words, the water, the meaning of the work of art.  But the fountain is only the focal point, Reading a Garden is the garden setting of mixed media interspersed throughout the garden.  To enjoy it, one must slow down and leave the workday behind.  The playful bronze figures who hang out in and around the garden were designed, along with the gates, by Tom Otterness.
Eastman Park opened in 1937 as an open air reading room dedicated to Linda Eastman. It was furnished with umbrellas, tables and racks of magazines.  By 1961, the garden was surrounded by gates and featured a wall fountain, but had few shade trees. The garden was renamed and dedicated in 1960 after the tunnel between the two library buildings was constructed.  Today, the space has grown up into a private oasis, a place to hide out.
In 1999, URS Consultants, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, and Robert P. Madison International were selected to renovate the original building and expand the library by building the new wing.  The $24 million renovation of the main building returned it to its original glory by restoring the ceilings, shining up the leather doors, cleaning the marble, and refurbishing historic light fixtures.  A substantial collection of permanent art includes beautiful murals in the great hall at the center of the buildingone of our skyscraper skyline and another of pastoral public square in the 1800s.  The $65 million Louis Stokes Wing was dedicated in 1997, and contains more than thirty miles of book shelves.  Thirteen artists of local and national reputation created original art for the Main Library, the Louis Stokes wing, and the Eastman Reading Garden.
During National Library Week, investigate the Cleveland Public Library.  Walk into its palace-like Main Building foyer and walk up the stairs by lamplight to where the large globe sits.  Explore the upstairs shelves of books in the literature department.  Sit down at one of the old-fashioned reading stations in the reference area of the grand hall, then walk into the foyer to take the stairs underground, underneath the gardens and over to the Louis Stokes Wing.  Be amazed by the huge collection of books on tape, music, and film in the audio-visual department in the basement and try to resist taking more than two items with you.  Walk up the cylindrical staircase in the modern silo structure to the first floor and check out the new books in the popular library.  Then take the elevator to the sixth floor to find the maps collection.
In celebration of Jazz Appreciation Month, two community performances will take place in Jazz in the Afternoon this Thursday (Evelyn Wright) and Friday (vocalist Chloe Hopson from the Passport Project) at 3.  The history of the Black Arts Movement, the key component of the Black Power Movement, will be explored by performance poet Mwatabu S. Okantah, on Saturday, at 2.  Always a good place to find good books, the Spring 2007 Used Book Sale will take place during the week of April 22 from 10-3.  Other regular library programs include the Fit for Life workshops, childrens story times and playtimes, a teen poetry club, computer classes, and the Ohio Center for the Book, which promotes books, reading, libraries, literacy, and authorship throughout Ohio with emphasis on Ohios literary heritage.
I had the pleasure of showing off the library to two full-fledged suburbanites this past weekend. They said it was like being on a tour of a foreign city, and they couldnt get over how beautiful it was. The downtown Main Cleveland Public Library made me proud.

All Shook Up @ Palace 4/10 Reasons to go: A splashy faux 50’s musical that takes Elvis songs and drops them into a tongue-in-cheek plot that’s part Footloose (a town rocked by a dancin’ stranger), part Hairspray (upbeat interracial romance), and a whole lotta Twelfth Night (girl becomes boy for love).  The light-as-Cool Whip book by Joe Pietro (I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change) is successful pastiche, brought to life by a big cast with high-power voices and fine comic timing.  From Susan Anton’s showgirl-on-steroids to Joe Mandragona’s sneer-and-ducktail roustabout to Jannie Jones’ gospel-inflected waitress to Dennis Moench’s lovesick nerd, the cast is engaging and charming.  Caveats: As the lovesick mechanic Natalie, Jenny Fellner has the pipes but not the charisma compared to the superb second bananas – she’s like a 75 watt bulb in a box full of halogens.   And sure, it’s fluff, but it’s a darn sight better than most jukebox musicals — with fun production numbers and music you already know how to hum.  Details: Palace Theatre, Cleveland. 216-241-6000. Thru 4/22. http://www.playhousesquare.com  From Cool Cleveland contributor Linda Eisenstein LindaATcoolcleveland.com
All Shook Up @ Palace 4/10 At the conclusion of All Shook Up, now on stage at the Palace Theatre, half of the audience was standing and cheering. The rest were sitting, looking at the standees as if they were out of their minds. One well-known local theatre performer commented, That was charming.  Another said, What in heck (word change to protect the conservative readers) were the producers thinking… that was awful!
All Shook Up is writer Joe DiPietros attempt to bridge together a story set in 1955 and the songs of Elvis Presley. The story line is trite, the characters are caricatures, the dancing is stylized (often done as if the cast was in an emotional time warp), the songs are blended into the dialogue with a shoe-horn, and the total effect is kitsch.
Into a small midwestern town rides Chad! Hes on a motorcycle, wears skin tight jeans, clinging t-shirt, has a twitching and thrusting pelvis, sings like a mediocre Elvis, makes women faint and scream, and causes general hyper-testosterone chaos. Before he leaves, he falls in love with a sexy female museum director (Miss Sandra), who rejects him, and then with a guy (Ed), who is actually a girl (Natalie). Ms. Sandra falls for the guy (Ed) who is really a girl (Natalie), but then switches allegiances to Dennis, a nerdy future dentist, who is in love with the girl (Natalie) but not her alter-ego, the guy (Ed).
Natalies father is in hot pursuit of Miss Sandra, but winds up with Sylvia, the Black owner of a bar whose daughter (Lorraine) is in love with Dean, the daughter of the towns up tight, racist mayor, Matilda.  Matilda, in turn is in love with… okay, this could go on and on, but you get the idea. West Side Story this is not. It doesnt even reach the literary level of the other Elvis musical, Bye Bye Birdie. But it is so ditzy, that its funny and lends itself to moaning over the idiocy.
Wedged into the plot are numerous rock n roll mega hits, including Jailhouse Rock (where the rocker finds himself because he lead the local town boys astray), Heartbreak Hotel (in this case referring to the graveyard at the end of the road) and One Night With You (sung in all sorts of coupling situations).  At one time or another almost the entire cast wears and warbles about their Blue Suede Shoes.
The touring company covers the extremes of talent and background. Susan Anton, a long time Broadway star, sings up a storm as Miss Sylvia, though her acting is paper thin. Her Theres Always Me stopped the show. She brought down the house with her one-liner describing the parochial nature of the plays setting: This town makes me miss Parma.
Professional newcomer Joe Manddragona, who plays rocker Chad, is shorter than would be expected for the macho male lead. All the females tower over him (which may have been another of those unintentionally intentional deeds of the director). He makes up for his height with smoldering good looks, a mobile pelvis and a fairly good voice.  His dancing is so down pat he almost looks like a robot and some of his lines are on the same emotional level.
Dennis Moench as nerdy Dennis, has the best voice in the cast and wins over the audience with a well-defined characterization (think Eugene in Grease and Hugo in Bye Bye Birdie). His It Hurts Me is poignantly tender.
Jannie Jones whales as Sylvia, the bar owner, though she goes off-key in spots.  Tracee Beazer is perky and sings well as Sylvias daughter. Jenny Fellner is undistinguished in the roles of Natalie/Ed.
The All Shook Up band rocks, sometimes too loudly, but that only enhances the over-all effect.
Director Christopher Ashley knows what hes doing. Taking this material seriously would have highlighted the weaknesses of the script.  By playing for exaggeration, creating caricatures and making the whole experience bigger than life he creates a living comic book. The results?  The audience laughs through their moans and bewilderment.
Capsule judgment: All Shook Up” is the kind of show that audiences will love or hate. Its going to depend on your mood and expectations. If you go in knowing there is a very slight story line (and even referring to it as a story line is an exaggeration), that is both unrealistic and obvious, and just let yourself get carried away by the over-the top performances, obvious choreography and transparent means used to hook the Elvis Presley fueled songs together, youll have a blast. If not, youll leave at intermission. Cmon Everybody Dont Be Cruel, Let Yourself Go, and you Cant Help Falling in Love with All Shook Up.”
The show runs through April 22 at the Palace Theatre in Playhouse Square.  For tickets call 241-6000, 800-766-6048 or go online to http://www.playhousesquare.com.

Research ShowCASE @ Veale Convocation Center, CWRU 4/12 Looks can be deceiving. At first glance, walking up and down the aisles, the products and posters on display at the 5th annual Research ShowCASE event looked like another typical industrial trade show. But in fact, no way, not at all. Some 500 researchers and scientists from Case, affiliating academic institutions, and neighboring medical centers ventured beyond their specialty areas, their silos, and joined together for two days of collaboration to highlight their research projects. Research ShowCASE attendees saw into the future, the research happening now in basic and applied science, education, public health, and the humanities.
Dexter, the autonomous self-driving robotic vehicle in a dune buggy-style chassis, was one of the celebrity stars in attendance. Team Case, a group of about 50 faculty, students, alumni and industry consultants, is re-engineering Dexter to compete in the upcoming (November 3) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Urban Challenge.
Dexter is loaded with sensors and computers to help it analyze and integrate where the vehicle is in space. Dexter must be able to navigate city streets, respond to other vehicles, obey traffic signs, and finish the 60-mile course in less than 6 hours to win the grand $2 million prize. Good luck Team Case!
The Bionic Man must have asked a family relative to attend this event. A man sitting in a wheelchair explained that he had suffered an incomplete spinal cord injury at level C6/C7. He had control over his left leg but not his right leg. Working with the Cleveland FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) Center, this man had 8 electrodes implanted into his non-functional leg to stimulate the muscles. Using a preprogrammed control device, he is now able to stand, walk for short distances with a walker, and live independently.
The multimedia demonstrations fascinated people making them stop, look, and listen. Three dimensional video cameras and TV monitors allowed viewers to have a real sense of space and experience more of the filmed environment. Plasma TVs, replacing static posters, were alive with research information as they changed formats providing live close-ups and action video clips. For me, a non-science person, this event turned into a Wow-Awesome, How-Did-They-Do-That? Research ShowCASE.

Infinite Variety: Cleveland Orchestra @ Severance Hall 4/12 Midway through the Haydn Symphony No. 103 Drum Roll I was struck by the many contrasts between it and the piece which led off the program, Lontano by György Ligeti, and I made the notation: Infinite Variety of Sounds. I had no idea that phrase would so perfectly describe the entire concert, which concluded with the Brahms Piano Concerto 2 featuring Emanual Ax as soloist.
When Ligeti wrote his piece in the 1960s, shimmering sound was a very popular factor in composition. Sometimes theres just one note, sometimes a chord. Volume may increase or decrease as various instruments join in or drop out of the communal effort. Notes are passed from one area of the orchestra to another, but little actually happens. Music director Franz Welser-Möst kept balances intact while herding the notes from one instrument group to another.
By contrast the military-like cadence on the tympani that led off the Haydn symphony seemed almost clangorous! It certainly garnered attention, and sent the melodious strains that followed into musical motion. The basses accompanied the tympani of Paul Yancich at one point, in an interesting sort of duet. Concertmaster William Preucils solo in the second movement andante was a demonstration of how it might have been done during the era when the symphony was composedlate 1794. It was very nearly an ornamented and embellished obbligato, soaring over the orchestra.
This symphony was not exactly an example of the composers usual jauntiness, but when one can hear such gorgeous sonorities performed so beautifully, who cares? It was a compelling performance.
Johannes Brahms had at least a slight case of inferiority complex, following so closely as he did in Beethovens footsteps. He remarked on it many times in reference to his symphonies, especially the first one, over which he labored for some twenty years. As a pianist of some renown, he didnt have quite the angst as a composer of concertos (and other piano works) as he did the symphony, but still, one wonders why on earth he persisted in his tiny, tiny piano concerto with a tiny, tiny wisp of a scherzo as he wrote in a letter to his friend Elisabet von Herzogenberg. Another friend (and pianist) Clara Schumann knew better, and how right she was! This concerto is the most grand (and probably most terrifying) example in the repertoire!
It requires a pianist of truly formidable talent and skill to wind his/her way through the torrents of notes contained within for nearly fifty minutes of intense music making! On this occasion, it was Emanual Ax, who fits that description to a certainty. Beginning with the beautiful opening notes of Richard King, principal horn through the final notes of the sprightly fourth movement that were drowned out by the cheers and shouts and applause, it was an experience not soon forgotten. Throughout (with one small period in the beginning of the third movement andante) the pianist works overtime with dense chords and melodies that traverse the keyboard from one end to the other. Its hard to believe, even while watching it happen, that its only ten fingers producing all that sound from the glistening Hamburg Steinway.
That third movement section which allows the pianist to rest is occupied by the principal cellist, in this case Desmond Hoebig, in an extended, very exposed, solo. It was gorgeously done.
Mr. Ax was appreciative, too. Never before, in all the times Ive been privileged to hear this concerto in person have I observed the artists bows to unfold in just this manner. When coming out for his solo bow, Mr. Ax went into the cello section, emerging hand-in-hand with Mr. Hoebig, and insisting that the two of them share the bow! Next time around when Mr. Welser-Möst accompanied Mr. Ax to the forefront, once again Mr. Ax commandeered Mr. Hoebig to appear with them as a trio at the front of the stage, bowing in unison. It was a lovely gesture and entirely appropriate!
On Thursday and Saturday evenings this week, Music Director Franz Welser-Möst conducts a program of Bach, Stravinsky and Verdi, assisted by Joela Jones, piano soloist in the Stravinsky and the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus in the Verdi. For more information or to purchase tickets, call 216.231.1111 or visit the web-site: http://www.clevelandorchestra.com

Cleveland Pops and the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra, Side By Side @ Severance Hall 4/13 In musical theater, the overture frequently is a mini-preview of whats to come, complete with bits and pieces of songs which will be presented in more detail during the coming performance. If that philosophy applied to Paul Fergusons Jazz Overture, which led off this concert Friday evening, then Id be in line to hear the entire show! (For example: the overture to Gershwins Crazy for You which led off the second half teased us with snippets of Ive Got Rhythm, Someone Wholl Watch Over Me and Stairway to Paradise. Great example!) The occasion for these wonderful musical events was the second version of a side by side concert by the Cleveland Pops Orchestra and the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra.
It just so happens that Mr. Ferguson is the principal trombonist for each of these erstwhile groups. In addition hes a brilliant composer and arranger, and not too shabby when it comes to putting down interesting licks on his chosen instrumentthe trombone. He demonstrated that ability, as well, playing the solo he wrote in to the overtrue for the principal trombone player, who just happened to be himself! And why not? The piece started with the strings, then morphed into some serious jazz, before engaging in a slight, but friendly duel to the background of Latin rhythms.
Cleveland Pops Orchestra is primarily conducted by its founder and music director Carl Topilow, while the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra is usually led its music director Jack Schantz, although not always. This side by side concert placed the CJO on stage left, more or less all together, with the strings of the CPO on stage right with winds and brass to the rear, merging with the CJO.
As always there were medleys: two vocal and two instrumental. One of the latter came next in a tribute to big bands of the past: Stan Kentons Big Band and Artistry in Rhythm; Glenn Miller Orchestra with Little Brown Jug; Les Browns Band of Renown and Sentimental Journey and the Count Basie Big Band with One OClock Jump, all as performed by the Pops.
Recently, the CJO released a CD titled The Surprise of Being, a suite written and arranged by its bassist Dave Morgan. The title piece, is a brassy, big band type of sound, with saxophones wailing here and there and a flugelhorn solo by Mr. Schantz in this really rhythmically strong work. Another selection from the suite is Marking Time, in which the drummer, Mark Gonder, turns off the snares as he engages in a duet with Kent Englehardts sax. This one also featured the vibraphone of Ron Busch.
The first of the vocal medleys was an arrangement of three old standards by Mr. Ferguson, for the crystalline voiced Helen Welch, once-upon-a-time from Britain, but now an Ohioan. Shes an enthusiastic entertainer, as demonstrated on The Trolley Song, Ill Be Seeing You and Walking After Midnight, originally made popular by the country singer Patsy Cline. It worked very well in the big city!
The other vocal medley, also arranged by Mr. Ferguson, was for Barbara Hesse, incorporating wonderful tunes by Harold Arlen. The two women are totally different in style and presentation, but both were wonderful singers and exceedingly adept at putting over a song. Its great to be able to understand every word! Among the Arlen favorites were Over the Rainbow (with Mr. Schantz doing the honors on trumpet), Come Rain or Come Shine, Stormy Weather (along with Mr. Engelhardt), Get Happy, Paper Moon, Ive Got a Right to Sing the Blues (with Mr. Ferguson), and Today I Love Everybody.
After the Arlen medley, Mr. Topilow left the stage, but quickly returned carrying his colorful (red, white and green) clarinet for his stint as a bad guy and the Theme from The Godfather. When the rhythm changed to a Latin beat, he switched back to the normal ebony clarinet and really gave it his all. Following this were two selections from West Side Story, which this year is celebrating 50 years on stage. Hard to believe. But the Taunting Scene and Somewhere, as arranged by Stan Kenton really moved! The CJO did full justice to the bold and brassy requirements of the former, punctuated by brilliant percussion and a gorgeous solo by Mr. Engelhardt. Pianist Rock Wehrmann had a neat bridge to the CPOs Somewhere, in a big, bold, and beautiful rendition.
After having heard the CJO in the Strayhorn/Ellington Nutcracker Suite last December, I was eager to hear Scheherajazz, a jazzy treatment of the second movement of the famous Rimsky-Korsakov orchestral showpiece, as arranged by the CJOs founder Roland Paolucci. Framed as a duel, sort of, between the two groups, it didnt work nearly as well. It begins in a pretty straightforward manner with strings and a gorgeous bassoon solo (Renee Dee) and then, maybe 32 bars in, all of suddenwowzer! This section was big and brassy, it just didnt last long enough. Some portions swung nicely. However, if the two groups werent exactly enemies, they werent exactly peaceful collaborators, either.
How High the Moon brought the happy musical evening to a close, featuring both conductors on their respective instruments, plus Scott Garlock on trombone in a swinging, festive rendition.

That Red Guy, a.k.a A Red Couch Floating in Lake Erie @ Masonic Auditorium, 4/14 One thing you can always count on at a concert by Red {an orchestra} is that you cant really count on anything of a pre-conceived notion. Itll get up-ended, every time. And that can only be a good thing! At least twice during the five years of Reds existence, weve been treated to music composed by or arranged by Jonathan Sheffer, Music Director of Red. This time, however, it was all music by Sheffer. Well, at least nearly so. True, the first music was a re-working of six J. S. Bach preludes, now known as The New-Tempered Clavier.
In 1996 or thereabouts, Sheffer decided to see how theyd work had they been written by composers of the minimalist school. His arrangements are for a fairly small string orchestra with one of each wind and brass instrument, but a wide array of percussion, particularly the tuned variety such as marimbas, xylophones and piano. The marimbas, especially, provided a sort of rippling effect, and the total was, in places, much like a huge organ. Seems to me that the Prelude in C Major from Book I is in the Philip Glass style, but I couldnt guess the others. I did find them all enjoyable, however.
If you didnt know you were listening to a soprano saxophone in his concerto Romp, a lot of the time you wouldnt know it was that somewhat unfamiliar instrument. In the hands and lips of Anders Paulsson, the Swedish musician for whom the concerto was composed, the instrument at various times took on the aura of an oboe, english horn, clarinet, flute or its larger cousins alto and tenor sax. Amazing! In addition to this amazing variety of sounds, there were also harmonics (two or more notes at the same time!) and purely gorgeous, sweet sounds emanating from his instrument.
Romp used a larger orchestra than the Bach pieces, especially noticeable for the persistent and frequently raucous percussion. There were bursts of flutter-tonguing from the trumpets, along with xylophones tingling in the background. Near the end the solo saxophone engaged in a dialogue with the snare drum. The drum may have been a bit snarky, but the sax enjoyed a charming, if plaintive melody, which curiously enough, complemented each other nicely.
Both of these were from about ten years ago, while the second half of the program gave us the world premiere of A Red Couch Floating in Lake Erie, or A Symphony of Songs. Its truly a Cleveland inspiration. It will always be uniquely ours, but wed be willing to share it with the world. A bit more than a year ago, Sheffer discovered the book Cleveland in Prose and Poetry, edited by Bonnie Jacobson, for the Poets and Writers League of Greater Cleveland. Within days, the libretto came into being using poems, mostly by Cleveland poets, plus a few prose statements from famous folks who visited here.
Having been at least a part-time resident of Cleveland for four years by then, Sheffer was able to capture our communitys psyche completely. The libretto divided itself into five parts: Symbols, Music, Sports, Weather and Regeneration.  It took about three months to compose the 45 minute work, and another four to complete the orchestration. It’s scored for a large orchestra and five singers: soprano, mezzo, tenor and two baritones. In order, the excellent singers were Andrea Chenoweth, Nichol Larimer, both recent graduates of CIM, tenor Carl Halvorson and baritones Andrew Garland and James Martin. They were all truly marvelous.
The only complaint I might offer is that because of the sometimes strange acoustics in Masonic Auditorium, the words were not always distinguishable. Generally, if there was only one singer, that worked fine, and sometimes duets, but when all five ventured out together, it was slightly mushy. At times, balance wasnt exact between orchestra and singers, either, but then, its hard to judge without an audience, too. I suspect that if its done againsay in a year or sosome of the bugs will have worked themselves out by then.
Sheffer writes wonderfully well for singers, not expecting them to make leaps from one end of their range to the other, and generally placing the notes well within their respective ranges. This is good for both singer and audience.
The large orchestra really dug in and produced massive chunks of sound when requested by the composer/conductor. At the other extreme, Lake Effect set to words by Helen Keller who was here during a blizzard in 1913, was magnificent in its quietness. Ms. Chenoweth displayed elegance and poignancy in her portrayal of the stillness found in the middle of a blizzard.
Sheffer recognized two of the local poets who were in the audience: George Bilgere and Robert McDonough, plus other notables, Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher, U. S. Senator Sherrod Brown, and his wife, the Pulitzer Prize winning columnist Connie Schultz.
Another world premiere was the live digital simulcast of an American orchestra into the 3D virtual web world called Second Life. More info is available through http://www.secondlife.com.

A Colored Funeral @ Karamu 4/15  What works: It’s the hard-working ensemble cast of five that brings most of the pleasure to Gregory Carr’s vaudeville-like evening of sketches and songs about the many unhealthy ways we court the Reaper.  Even though the many changes slow things down, Harold Crawford’s costumes dazzle.  Scissors, please: The evening’s way too long; 10 punchy vignettes would be better than 20 that meander and repeat.  The humor works better than the more serious monologues, which drip with sentimentality and preachiness:  you haven’t heard this many warnings since a medieval morality play.

Tri-C 2007 Annual Juried Student Exhibition @ Tri-C Western Campus  Gallery West 4/15 From exacting perspective drawings to bold, deliberate paintings youll be impressed with the gifted student artists at Tri-C Western Campus. Youll be even more impressed when you realize that many of the entrants are from the Drawing I classes where no previous drawing experience is required. One of my favorites is a single point perspective by Linda Muha whose ability to turn paper and charcoal into gleaming glass baffles me. The annual juried exhibition formally opens April 25 with a reception and awards ceremony but you have until June 16 to view the works free of charge. Gallery West is located on the second floor of the library. Check out the Tri-C website for hours and specific directions but in a nutshell, no matter where you park or which doorway you enter, all hallways lead to the atrium where youll easily find the library and the show. http://www.tri-c.edu/gallerywest.

Writers and Readers Series: Michael Chabon @ CPL 4/15 It was a mind-expanding adventure. The stage backdrop in the basement auditorium of the Louis Stokes Wing dubs the Cleveland Public Library the Peoples University. Block posters focus on the myriad programs available for enhancing the quality of life for a diverse community, including the YRead? Youth Unite Through Books program. The auditorium was packed for Pulitzer-prize winning writer Michael Chabons April 15 appearance as part of the Writers and Readers Series. The audience was as energized as a Cleveland Film Festival crowd, and, like the Film Festival, the demographics varied.
The crowd came together to see and hear Michael Chabon, who emerged in 1988 with his first novel The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, written for his masters thesis at the University of California at Irvine, after achieving his bachelors degree at the University of Pittsburgh. The writer was introduced by something hes said: he reads for entertainment and writes to entertain. He seemed pleased by the size of his audience, relating a recent appearance he made in Orange County (he lives in Berkeley with wife Ayelet Waldman and their four children) where only a few people showed.  He admitted that his lifes work, a mix of reflection on Jewishness and genre fiction, was really about the search for home.
Michael Chabon was engaging, sharp, witty, intelligent, thoughtful, and human as he told the story of how he came upon a little book about Yiddish in a book store and was amused.  He wrote an essay about the absurdity of a guide to little-spoken Yiddish called Guidebook to a Land of Ghosts, which was published by Civilization Magazine. He is an American Jew living in exile, which is why he has been searching.
Up until he found that little book, presumably when he was writing The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and Wonder Boys, Chabons back was turned on his Jewish heritage. He also gave up science fiction writing when the genre was summarily dismissed in college writing classes. In both instances, he was trying to fit inhe was not going to be a typical Jewish boy and he was not going to be a writer of genre fiction.  As he said, he grooved along in my lostness.
He article in Civilization Magazine ruffled some feathers. He angered lovers of the native tongue and profoundly hurt the widow co-author of the book on Yiddish, whose husband was a beloved scholar. This event caused Chabon to realize how ignorant he was about his people, and he was ashamed. He turned around, towards Judaism.
His first novel was about a protagonist in a romantic triangle with a man and a woman who chose neither in the end, affirming a bisexual nature, and it was set in Pittsburghs colorful Oakland neighborhood. The second novel was drawn from his own frustrated efforts to write his yet-unpublished Fountain City  it is the story of a writer going through a divorce and not able to finish a novel. The author was finding his failure through writing, as writers are meant to do, and Wonder Boys was written in a seven-month whirlwind.
In 2000, he published The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, a tale set in the 1930s and 40s about two guys who write comic books after the one cousin escapes from Europe with a Gollum. The book was more richly woven with Jewish culture and more complex than his previous books, and in 2001, Chabon won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Since then, Chabon has written the novella The Final Solution, about a Sherlock Holmes-like character, a favorite childhood topic. He created the Dark Horse Comics project The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, a quarterly anthology series about one of the comic book characters from his comic-book novel. His serialized novel called Gentlemen of the Road debuted in The New York Times Magazine in January 2007.  As a screenplay writer, he wrote Spiderman 2.
His latest novel, The Yiddish Policemens Union, is to be released in May; it promises to be a thriller set in an imaginary world inspired by Franklin Roosevelts short-lived plan to create a Jewish homeland in Alaska.  After the authors presentation, the questions raised by the audience during Chabons session ranged from how to find solitude to write, advice on screen writing, whether his wife is writing another book, to his feelings about Yiddish today.  The afternoon series gives writers and readers a chance to connect.
The Poets and Writers Series has featured 42 writers over its history.  So far this year Erin Gruwell and Connie Briscoe have made appearances.  Thrity Umrigar is the guest on May 20.  This is only one of the rich programs inspired by The Cleveland Public library, whose  vision is to be a learning place for a diverse community, inspiring people of all ages with the love of books and reading, advancing the pursuit of knowledge, and enhancing the quality of life for all who use the library.

On colorblind justice in NEO (See Justice not colorblind in Cuyahoga County here) Dear Judge Sutula: I have just finished reading Justice not colorblind in Cuyahoga County: Unequal sentences prove it. It sadness me greatly to see such an influential women use her powerful role in society to cause unjust to another women (Robbie Moore, a 30-year-old Black woman). I was taught many values during my childhood. One was that women were just as capable as men, and were to be treated equally. It wasn’t until my late teens, in the late 1990’s, that I understood differently. When I confronted my mother on why I was not aware that there was so much inequality to women, her response was, “I was hoping by the time you reach an age where you would comprehend that women were treated differently; it would no longer be the case.” Since this I have gone on to pursue a male-dominated career. During this time, I have seen women being treated unfairly, or not as an equal to male counterparts. It is ironic to me that about half the time I see this injustice, it is actually women themselves that treat other women as they are in a second-class to men. I now ask why women would do this to other women?from Cool Cleveland reader Heather Mason-Suares hmm9ATcase.edu
Dear Judge Sutula: I fully support the sentence you imposed on Robbie Moore.  With the info I have re. her “license suspension” as in the article I read, I can see the reduction by 4 years on the sentence.  I also know that with parole and time served that practically no one serves their full sentence. My only question is – Why is no one objecting to the lower sentence given to James Skolsky?  Maybe the question should be why is the sentence so lenient for a white man with a previous DUI rather than why so harsh on a black female.  And sex and race should not be a factor in any case. It is time that those who drink excessively and then kill someone must receive the same punishment whether they use a gun or a car.from Cool Cleveland reader Jack Seemuth retiredguy42AToh.rr.com
Dear Judge Sutula: The report of the 20 year sentence to a black woman, (Robbie Moore,) while a white man,(James Skolsky,) got a one day sentence from you for the same basic crime is not right. I want a society and a justice system that is fair. It is wrong to penalize a black person more than a white person for a similar crime. It is even more wrong  to settle upon such a huge disparity in the punishment. It is even worse, when the woman had no previous DUI, while the man did. He should get the more severe sentence. I am white, so since you respect whites more than blacks, maybe you will listen to my opinion. In my opinion, a racist like you is not fit to judge others in court. You should wise up. I want you impeached.from Cool Cleveland reader Martha Lois martha.lois@sbcglobal.net
Please don’t misunderstand my comment about this case because I completely agree with one sentence being more harsh than the other. However, I do not agree that this situation is not about race, or gender. The first words written for this article was: Robbie Moore, a 30-year-old Black woman, and James Skolsky, a 32-year-old White man, so the fact that your pointing out this is not a racial issue, is not true. Had the article been started without the races, ages, or genders, it may have been a little easier to agree with this. I am an African American woman, and I still get tired of articles, statements, comment, etc. stating: “This is not a racial matter, however, the people that were done wrong were of color.” It is just crazy to contradict yourself like this. Yes, I agree being African American may come with some disadvantages; however, these disadvantages are due to stereotypes that people can’t seem to get over. This issue is about unfair justice, lets focus on the preliminaries of that, and not on the external factors. from Shaleena Brown shaleena_brownATyahoo.com
On the Cleveland Orchestra/OperaCleveland schedule conflict Dear Kelly, I read your recent post in the Cool Cleveland e-newsletter expressing disappointment that Franz Welser-Möst’s Der Rosenkavalier lecture and opening night of OperaCleveland’s inaugural season both are scheduled on this Friday, April 20. We regret the conflict of these two important events. We did explore adjusting the lecture date, but unfortunately it was not possible due to Franz’s rehearsal and performance schedule and the many rental and community activities scheduled at Severance Hall this spring. Franz has many insights to share about Richard Strauss and his works. For those who are unable to attend in person on April 20, we are offering access to Franz’s lecture in the following ways:
We hope that you, and others who will be attending OperaCleveland’s Salomé performance on April 20, will have the opportunity to listen and view the lecture on Der Rosenkavalier through one of these alternative options. I am a great supporter of the new Opera Cleveland and wish them every success as they launch their first season. Thank you and Cool Cleveland for your attentive and complete coverage of The Cleveland Orchestra and of all the wonderful arts in Cleveland. Thank you again for bringing your concern to my attention.from Cool Cleveland reader Gary Hanson, Executive Director, The Cleveland Orchestra
