The Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, has said:
"Last night’s bloody terrorist attack in Paris was a blind but targeted strike. It was a blow against Europe, home of Democracy and freedom, a blow against multiculturalism.
At this hour we all stand together, we strengthen our solidarity towards the French people and support their government. We fight against the plans of terrorism and barbarism. The terrorists will prevail only if they achieve to terrorise us; only if they force us to abandon our principles; if they lead us to a fortress-Europe, where scared people live."
Don't allow this horrific act allow you to be drawn into the loss of your humanity or tolerance. That is the intended outcome. #ParisAttacks
Elton John has taken to his Instagram page to show his support with this quote from Martin Luther King Jr:
“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”
François Hollande has said: "Facing terror, there is a nation that knows how to defend, able to mobilize its forces and, once again, will defeat the terrorists."
Face à l'effroi, il y a une Nation qui sait se défendre, sait mobiliser ses forces et, une fois encore, saura vaincre les terroristes.
Face aux attaques terroristes d’une gravité exceptionnelle, mes premières pensées vont aux victimes de ces actes de barbarie (1/2) -NS
à leurs familles, à leurs proches et aux forces de sécurité qui font preuve d’un courage exemplaire. (2/2) -NS
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.
