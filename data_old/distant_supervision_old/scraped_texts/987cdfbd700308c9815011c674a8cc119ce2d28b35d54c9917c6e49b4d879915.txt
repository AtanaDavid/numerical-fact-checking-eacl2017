The Microsoft Surface concept has come a long way. From a simple concept that was created by the tech company to an entire lineup that is now one of the most appreciated lineups in the world, the Surface lineup is truly a successful business. With the lineup’s sales on the market, Microsoft’s profit increased more each year.
According to Microsoft’s latest earning reports the sales of Surface devices had grown up 38 percent in the last quarter (Q1 2017) reaching $926 million, compared to last year when they made just $672 million. Most of the earnings come from the sales of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, declared that there are over 500 orders of Surface devices that comes from enterprises which are increasing the profits by 70 percent. This incredible success isn’t surprising. In early 2015 the product line marked a billion dollar profit and since then the income is still growing. Microsoft Surface devices are increasing the desire to a 2in1 device which means that the gadget should be a laptop with detachable keyboard that will make it a tablet. We can agree that Microsoft started this trend with the 2in1 gadgets.
Microsoft’s latest events didn’t quite get us excited. There was no notable release except Microsoft’s latest artistic gimmick which is basically a massive touchscreen display for graphic designers. Everybody is expecting a Surface Pro 5 or a Surface Book 2 release but every passing day it seems like these devices won’t see the light of day this year at least. We expect to see both of those devices in 2017. We also expect to see more devices in the Surface lineup like the Surface Phone or the Surface All-inOne, but only time will shed some light on these gadgets.
