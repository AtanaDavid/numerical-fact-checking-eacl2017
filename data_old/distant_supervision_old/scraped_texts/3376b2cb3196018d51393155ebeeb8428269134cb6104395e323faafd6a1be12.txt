Close to 3,000 fans stampeded into the Farm Show Arena this evening to see Harrisburg's version of indoor football.
The Harrisburg Stampede exhibition game against American Indoor Football League All-Stars kicked off at 7:30 p.m. with all the elements of a pro event -- cheerleaders, concessions, thumping music, giveaways and, of course, plenty of curious spectators.
"Its evening time. What more can you do in the winter? We like football," said Robert Dennis of Harrisburg who sat in the stands with his son, Aidan Dennis, 8.
The $10 ticket price was a bonus.
"It's affordable for a night out with the way the economy is today," said Marcella McDuffy of Harrisburg.
John Morris, the team's owner who also owns the AIFA league, said people have been calling the Stampede's office thanking him and the staff for bringing the team to the midstate.
"People are starving for this," he said. "We call it good, affordable family fun."
