Michal told BNS that he does not agree with fellow Reform Party member Jurgen Ligi, a former finance minister
and present education minister, who said that the government cannot react to
the dramatic drop in the oil shale prices by changing Estonia's industrial
policy.
"Our experts have calculated
with the Ministry of Finance for weeks and in the coming weeks the Cabinet is
to discuss based on the results how to make the fees for using mineral
resources depend of international market prices. Such a tax system, not just a
temporary benefit or advantage, is definitely anticipated by entrepreneurs and
will help to manage during difficult times," Michal said.
Ligi said at Thursday's government
press conference that "it is absurd to think that the government could
react to a dramatic drop in oil prices that the private sector couldn't even
dream about".
Finance Minister Sven Sester also said that creating a
tax benefit is usually not the best plan.
