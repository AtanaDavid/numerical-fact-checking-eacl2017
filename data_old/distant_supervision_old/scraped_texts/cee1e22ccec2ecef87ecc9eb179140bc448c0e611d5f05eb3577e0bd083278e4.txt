Kansas City’s Restoration Emporium has been named first runner-up in Microsoft’s second annual video contest for small businesses.
Hundreds of entrepreneurs and small business owners from all over the country shared two-minute videos about their companies.
While the West Bottoms-based home decor and furnishings company didn’t win the top prize, the owners are still pretty jazzed about coming in at No. 2. The first runner-up title means Restoration Emporium is taking home $10,000 plus a Surface Pro 4 and an Office 365 subscription.
The prize money and software subscription will help owners Chrysalyn and Jeff Huff make much-needed updates to their business’s IT infrastructure.
