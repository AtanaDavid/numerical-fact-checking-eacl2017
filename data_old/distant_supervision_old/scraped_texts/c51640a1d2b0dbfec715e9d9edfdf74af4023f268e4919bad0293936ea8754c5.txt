The GSM Association (GSMA), hosts of Mobile World Congress has just announced the winners of the 20th Global Mobile Awards, and the award for Best Mobile Tablet goes to… The Microsoft Surface Pro 3!
Microsoft’s Surface Pro 3 takes the award this time around from the Apple iPad Air, which won the award in 2014. Microsoft’s hybrid PC has been a hit in a number of different industries and markets, including education and healthcare, as well as among consumers. Its versatility in accepting multiple input methods, its long battery life and strong performance has made it the go-to device for those looking for a no-compromise mobile computing experience.
As for the other award categories, the Nokia Lumia 520 lost its place to the Motorola Moto E for ‘Best Low Cost Smartphone’. Given that Microsoft didn’t have a flagship Windows Phone device to show, the company had nothing to contend with the Apple iPhone 6 and LG G3 that tied for ‘Best Smartphone’.
Still, the Surface Pro 3 getting selected by the GSMA as the Best Mobile Tablet to buy at this point is still a big deal, and it goes to show how far Microsoft has come since it unveiled the first Surface device in mid-2012.
