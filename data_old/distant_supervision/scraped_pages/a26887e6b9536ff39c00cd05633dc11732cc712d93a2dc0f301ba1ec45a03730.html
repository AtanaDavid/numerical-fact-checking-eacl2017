The subsidiary targets a weighted average  portfolio maturity of approximately one year. This average maturity is longer  than that of money market funds, which are restricted  to weighted average maturities of 60 days or less, but shorter than Bond Units, which have an average maturity of  approximately seven years. </p>
      <p class="text">Investments in the fund  are made in high quality fixed income securities, primarily consisting of U.S.  government issued Series I (inflation adjusted) and Series EE (fixed rate)  Savings Bonds.&nbsp; Other holdings include  U.S. government agency securities, corporate /bank securities, and other high  quality obligations.&nbsp; &nbsp;A portion of the Common Assets fund is  invested in loans to participants.</p>
      <p class="text">U.S. Savings Bonds are  backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.&nbsp;&nbsp; Series I Savings Bonds pay a rate of  interest based on the rate of inflation in the United States.&nbsp; A decline in the rate of inflation would  reduce the portfolio yield.&nbsp; U.S. Savings  Bonds have stated maturities of 30 years but can be redeemed after a 1 year  holding period.&nbsp; They are considered as 1-year investments by the fund.</p>

      <p class="text">The Common Assets fund  is managed with a target of maintaining a constant $1.00 per unit price.  Although the Common Assets fund has maintained a constant unit price since its  inception (and is thus considered a relatively conservative investment choice),  there can be no assurance that it will always be able to do so (meaning you  could lose money). The underlying assets in participants&rsquo; accounts are valued  on the basis of cost rather than market value, which means the asset value does  not include unrealized gains and losses.</p>
      <p class="text">Any investment earnings  on Common Assets are posted to participants&rsquo; Savings Plan Accounts as of the  end of each quarter and are reinvested in Common Assets. Earnings on Common  Assets include accrued income and realized gains and losses. These earnings are  shared proportionally by participants based on the average daily Common Assets  balance in their Savings Plan Accounts during that quarter. Common Assets  investments are made as soon as practical after funds are available. All  expenses of managing Common Assets are borne by the company except for certain  investment management fees of approximately 0.01% that are borne by the fund.  By writing to the Savings Plan Administrator (see <a href="SavingsAdministrative.html">page 47</a>), you may request a  list of the assets that make up the Common Assets fund.</p>

		  <p class="text"><strong>Indexed<a name="Indexed"></a> Investing</strong><br>
            Equity Units, Extended Market Units, International Equity Units, Bond Units and Balanced Fund Units are all "indexed" investments. Indexing is a commonly used investment strategy in which the investment manager seeks to closely approximate the performance of a market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500  Index (S&P 500).  Indexed investments have advantages such as clear investment strategy, automatic diversification and low fees.
</p>
		  <p class="text">When a fund is indexed, the investment manager generally exercises little subjective judgment in choosing securities since, in order to mirror the performance of the index, the manager must invest in the securities that constitute the index largely in proportion to their weight. Indexing provides automatic diversification because your money is spread over a large number of individual securities, so it is not as impacted by the performance of any one security.  For funds based on indices with thousands of securities, the manager  may choose to use a sampling or an optimization process to design a portfolio that has similar characteristics to the index but not holding every security as a means of controlling transaction costs. This practice is used for Extended Market Units, International Equity Units, Bond Units and Balanced Fund Units.   
		    </p>
		  <p class="text">In contrast, funds that are not indexed usually are managed actively. In an actively managed fund, the investment manager has wide discretion as to which securities to purchase and sell and may follow any number of investment strategies in an effort to "beat the market." However, studies have shown that, on average, actively managed funds do not outperform indexed funds. Fees tend to be lower for indexed funds because they have lower research and transactions costs.

      <p class="text"><strong>Making Investments<a name="MakingInvestments"></a></strong> <br>
Investments by the indexed funds are made as soon as practical after monies are available. Although each of the underlying funds seeks to remain fully invested consistent with their target index, part of the funds may be kept in cash to provide necessary liquidity for next-day settlements. The funds may hold futures contracts to approximate movements of the funds' target indices, but the funds will not engage in speculative futures transactions.  The funds also participate in securities lending in order to reduce fund expenses. </p>

       NT selects brokers on the basis of best net execution. Any fees, associated charges or brokerage commissions in connection with the administration of the funds are charged against the assets of the funds. In addition, NT receives a monthly investment management fee which is  computed as a percentage of fund net assets.

            <p class="text">When you buy Exxon Mobil  Corporation Common Stock (ExxonMobil stock), you become an ExxonMobil  shareholder and an owner of the company. Any dividends on shares of stock in  your <a href="javascript:n_window('SavingsKeyTerms.html#kt32');">Savings Plan Account</a> are credited as of the  dividend payment date. These dividends are reinvested automatically in  ExxonMobil stock unless you elect to have the dividends paid to you directly in  cash (see <a href="SavingsAccessing.html#pg30">page 30</a>). Remember, investing  in a single security typically carries higher potential risk than investing in  a variety of securities (e.g., stocks and bonds). Be sure to consider balancing  your portfolio with the other investments in the Savings Plan.
      <p class="text"> 
        Participants&rsquo; purchase  and sell orders may be offset against each other and the net number of shares  may be purchased or sold in separate transactions or as a pooled transaction.  This results in lower transaction costs for trades involving ExxonMobil stock.  Such purchases and sales may be made in the open market, in privately  negotiated transactions, or from/to Exxon Mobil Corporation to the extent it  elects to sell or purchase such shares. Prices for open market or private  transactions reflect market pricing. Prices for purchases cannot exceed, and  prices for sales cannot be below, the then-current market value of the shares.  The price of any purchase from or sale to Exxon Mobil Corporation is the  volume-weighted average price per share of ExxonMobil stock on the New York  Stock Exchange (NYSE) composite tape on the transaction day.</p>
      <p class="text">Brokerage commissions or  other fees incurred on purchases or sales of ExxonMobil stock made in the open  market are included as a part of the cost of the purchase or sale transaction.  Brokers are selected on the basis of execution ability. No brokerage  commissions are paid on shares purchased from or sold to Exxon Mobil  Corporation. </p>
      <p class="text">While investment  instructions are executed promptly, purchases and sales may be executed over a  period of days depending on market conditions and any legal restrictions.</p>
