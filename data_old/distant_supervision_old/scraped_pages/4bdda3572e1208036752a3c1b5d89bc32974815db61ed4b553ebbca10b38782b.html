                        him finish among the top 10 in a quarter of his 36 starts...Knocked 
                        on the victory door three times only to come up short 
                        with three runner-up finishes, all in the second half

                        his grasp at the Kroger Senior Classic. Closed with a 
                        career-best 7-under 63 at Kings Island on Sunday and was 
                        two strokes up on Jim Thorpe with one hole to play. Dramatic 
                        eagle by Thorpe forced a playoff and then a birdie by

                        Made birdie on the final hole to nip Kermit Zarley by 
                        a stroke at St. Charles CC in Winnipeg...Victory came 
                        just over a month after his wife, Martha, delivered Tom, 
                        Jr...Contended for titles earlier in the year at the Nationwide 
                        Championship, BellSouth Senior Classic at Opryland and 
                        The Instinet Classic where he was the defending champion. 
                        Carded a final-round 69 at the Nationwide, but came up 
                        one stroke short of Hale Irwin. Lost out again to Irwin 
                        by two strokes in Nashville despite posting a 54-hole 
                        score of 16-under 200, his best effort all year in relation 
                        to par. Was tied with Bob Murphy for the 36-hole lead 
                        at the TPC at Jasna Polana, but dropped back into solo 
                        fourth place after shooting a 71 on Sunday...Went over 
                        the $2 million in SENIOR TOUR career earnings with his 
                        seventh-place finish at the LiquidGolf.com Invitational. 
                        1999: Voted by his peers as the SENIOR TOUR's Comeback 
                        Player of the Year...Was third among all senior players 
                        with 17 top-10 finishes and won the Bell Atlantic Classic 
                        in a playoff near Philadelphia. Defeated Jim Thorpe with 
                        a birdie on the first extra hole for his first SENIOR 
                        TOUR victory and first TOUR title since the 1975 IVB-Philadelphia 
                        Classic. Win at Hartefeld National made him the fifth 
                        of a record 11 first-time winners on the season. 1998: 
                        Contended for the AT&T Canada Senior Open Championship 
                        crown in Calgary, but finished T2 behind Brian Barnes...One 
                        of nine players to have two eagles in a round, doing so 
                        at the EMC Kaanapali Classic. 1997: Earned a conditional 
                        exemption for 1998 by placing 10th at the SENIOR TOUR
