As well as guaranteeing him places at Augusta and next year’s US Open, he is almost certain to finish high enough in the money list to qualify for the Open. Next year he could even take up his PGA Tour card because of his US earnings. Not bad for a player who never even played in America before last week.
Indeed, this was only Lynn’s second major (he finished outside the top 50 in the 2003 Open at Sandwich). He scraped into the US PGA field as the world No98, but he almost missed the opportunity.
“If I played in the Austrian Open, I would have needed a high finish there to retain my place in the top 100. I nearly went, but decided not to and found out the Tuesday before that I’d got my place in Kiawah. I think I made the right choice.”
Yesterday the Americans were scrambling information about the Englishman who was not so much quiet as anonymous. They found out Lynn is renowned as one of the biggest pranksters on the European Tour.
Recently he has become involved in the internet ‘planking’ craze in which he takes pictures of himself lying face down in unusual locations.
“It's only a laugh,” he said. “One the boys have liked is me with my head in a washing machine and my toes on a table top. Now that’s uncomfortable. Probably more uncomfortable even than being up there in a major.”
Lynn was actually disappointed to finish five under. “I missed a few putts,” he said. “I’ve always known I have the game for majors. I just haven’t qualified for many. This will do wonders for my self-belief.”
He took second at the expense of his countryman, Ian Poulter, who leapfrogged Sergio García into the last qualifying Ryder Cup spot.
