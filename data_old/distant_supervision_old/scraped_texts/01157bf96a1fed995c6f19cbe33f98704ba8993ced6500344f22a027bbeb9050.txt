The day commenced with six times National Men’s Champion Tim Vail easing his way
into the final following a 3-0 win over Luke Bishop. Vail’s opponent
in the final was Ted Jeal who was heavily fatigued from his semi-final against Mike Harris but was no contest for the stylish Tim Vail.
Meanwhile, in the Women’s event Natalie Lawrence, who had earlier won
the Over 35s championship, completed the double when she beat Chloe Marshall 3-0 to take the Women’s title.
