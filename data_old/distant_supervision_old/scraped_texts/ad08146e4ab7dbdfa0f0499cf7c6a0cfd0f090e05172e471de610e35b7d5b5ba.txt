Knowing this data, we can also assume that the average United States citizen has at least one negative entry on their credit report. This could be a late or missed payment, collections, a foreclosure, etc.
If your credit score falls below 750, you’re credit report is almost certain to contain at least one negative entry. We can safely assume that the 70 point difference between 750 and the average credit score, 650, would typically be reflective of more than one negative entry.
