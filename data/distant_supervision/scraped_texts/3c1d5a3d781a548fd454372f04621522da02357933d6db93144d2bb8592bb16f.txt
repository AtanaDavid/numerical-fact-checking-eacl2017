Our focus is to monitor and assess the impact of strategies and activities for reducing morbidity and mortality of vaccine-preventable diseases.  Collection, analysis and interpretation of surveillance data is vital to guide vaccination policies and programmes and ensure immunization targets are being reached.
Our activities are guided by the principles set out in the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), a global framework set out to achieve the Decade of Vaccines (DoV) vision of delivering universal access to immunization by 2020, and beyond.
Through strengthening of routine immunization programmes to meet coverage targets and accelerate control of vaccine-preventable diseases, the aim is to reach – and exceed – the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 target for a two-thirds reduction in child mortality by 2015.
Information on the current burden of vaccine preventable diseases, including disease-specific estimates of morbidity and mortality and global laboratory surveillance networks.
Information on monitoring the performance, quality and safety of immunization systems through indicators, including immunization coverage.
Reports from WHO Member States including information on estimates of national immunization coverage, reported cases of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), immunization schedules, and indicators of immunization system performance.
