SECOND
TIME
IT
STICKS
Opportunity
and
J.C.
Wiley
Meet
in
Del
Rio
By
DICK
ALWAN
Kuidoso
Downs
Publicity
Director
RUIDOSO
DOWNS,
N.M.
A
few
years
ago,
Opportunity
came
knocking
at
J.C.
Wiley&#039;s
door,
but
the
young
jockey
was
too
discouraged
and
disgusted
to
know
the
difference.
So
Opportunity
passed
him
by
—
the
first
time,
at
least.
The
second
time
around,
Wiley
was
ready.
He
grabbed
Opportunity
with
both
list«
and
wouldn&#039;t
let
go.
In
just
a
few
short
months
—
since
the
start
of
the
current
Ruidoso
Downs
meeting
—
Wiley
vaulted
from
a
bush-
track
rider
to
one
of
the
year&#039;s
best
quarter
horse
jockeys.
Only
23,
he&#039;s
been
riding
on
the
small-time
Texas
circuit
for
the
past
eight
years,
and
figures
he&#039;s
the
No.
I
rider
out
there
in
the
sticks.
Last.
December,
his
career
got
a
sharp
boost
when
he
won
the
$110,000
Louisiana
Futurity
at
Delta
Downs
on
a
41-1
longshol.
But
generally,
he
says,
it&#039;s
been
a
long
climb,
and
a
pretty
dismal
one.
Most
of
the
time,
he
felt
he
wasn&#039;t
getting
anywhere.
&quot;There
are
a
lot
of
good
riders
out
there,&quot;
Wiley
says
in
a
low-key
and
monotone
voice.
&quot;They
have
a
lot
of
ability,
and
a
lot
of
potential.
But
they
don&#039;t
get
to
know
the
right
people,
they
don&#039;t
get
any
breaks
...&quot;
That
was
the
gloomy
mood
Wiley
was
up
against
when
he
came
to
Ruidoso
in
May
on
a
wing
and
prayer.
The
only
thing
he
had
for
sure
was
some
work
as
an
exercise
rider
—
plus
the
slim
comfort
of
being
the
second-line
rider
for
the
powerful
stable
of
Trainer
Bubba
Werner.
&quot;That
was
reaching
for
the
moon,&quot;
Wiley
says.
&quot;It&#039;s
pretty
remote
for
one
stable
to
support
two
jockeys.
What
I
was
hoping
was
that
Bubba
might
qualify
two
horses
for
a
big
futurity,
and
I&#039;d
get
to
ride
one
of
them.&quot;
That,
at
least,
was
the
way
the
situation
looked
in
mid-
May.
Now
look
at
Wiley;
he&#039;s
in
the
top
10
in
jockey
standings,
he
rides
some
of
the
best
stock
around,
he&#039;s
been
in
the
finals
of
the
$338,208
Rainbow
Derby,
the
$413,150
Kansas
Futurity,
and
the
$368,784
Rainbow
Futurity.
He
also
rode
Sheswright
in
the
$84,265
World&#039;s
Championship
Classic,
and
he
won
the
Zia
Stakes
with
Dancing
Butler.
In
short,
that&#039;s
the
kind
of
success
you
dream
about
while
knocking
heads
on
the
bush
track
circuit,
hoping
Opportunity
will
come
along
and
give
you
a
chance
to
show
your
stuff
on
some
top
stock.
Wiley&#039;s
first
chance
came
about
five
years
ago,
but
he
let
it
slip
through
his
fingers.
&quot;I
was
down
at
Del
Rio,
Texas,
where
I
was
riding
for
Trainer
James
Bertrand,&quot;
ne
explains.
&quot;But
I
got
where
I
felt
I
wasn&#039;t
getting
anywhere.
I
felt
pretty
disgusted,
so
I
didn&#039;t
show
up
for
a
few
days.
Bertrand
got
mad,
of
course.
So
he
quit
using
me
as
his
first-call
rider,
and
got
Tad
Ober.
Tad
and
I
were
living
together
at
the
time,
and
he
was
my
best
friend.&quot;
About
the
time
Bertrand
signed
up
Ober,
17
(a
total
unknown
in
quarter
horse
racing,
he
also
got
the
filly,
Pass
Over,
She
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
truly
great
mares
in
quarter
horse
racing,
earning
$521,000.
As
Pass
Over
streaked
her
way
to
fame,
she
hauled
Ober
with
her
—
for
the
first
leg
of
the
journey,
at
least.
The
youngster
was
aboard
in
1973
when
she
won
the
Sun
Country
Futurity
at
Sunland
Park
Park
and
the
Kansas
Futurity
at
Ruidoso,
for
example.
&quot;If
I
would
have
stuck
with
Bertrand
at
the
time,
I
could
have
been
riding
Pass
Over,&quot;
Wiley
says.
&quot;I
just
took
it
as
an
experience.
The
lesson
I
learned
was
don&#039;t
give
up.&quot;
Wiley
says
he
never
begrudged
Ober
his
success
on
Pass
Over,
and
the
two
remained
close
pals.
But
that
part
of
the
story
came
to
an
ironic
and
tragic
end.
One
day
in
&#039;74
(Ober
had
since
lost
the
assignment
on
Pass
Over),
Wiley
got
a
call
at
the
barn
where
he
was
working.
&quot;They
told
me
Ober
had
died.
They
said
he
shot
himself
with
a
.44
magnum.
At
least
that&#039;s
what
they
put
down
in
the
newspaper.
It
always
puzzled
me.
Tad
never
seemed
the
kind
to
worry
about
anything.
When
they
told
me
about
it,
I
couldn&#039;t
believe
it.
It
was
kind
of
hard
to
swallow.&quot;
Wiley
got
serious
about
riding
again,
and
resolved
to
stick
it
out.
&quot;There
are
a
lot
of
boys
who
get
depressed
even
before
they
get
started,&quot;
he
recalled.
He
reasoned:
&quot;As
long
as
there&#039;s
races
going
on,
there&#039;s
going
to
be
breaks,&quot;
But
he
ran
into
&quot;a
lot
of
bad
breaks
&quot;last
year.
He
explains:
&quot;After
being
the
leading
rider
on
the
bush
track
circuit,
it
seemed
I
just
couldn&#039;t
win
a
race.
I
don&#039;t
know
why
—
my
horses
were
just
getting
outrun.
But
this
time
I
didn&#039;t
think
of
quitting.&quot;
The
downward
trend
was
reversed
in
December
when
he
qualified
eighth-best
with
Azure.
Fair
in
that
$110,000
Futurity
in
Louisiana,
then
won
the
finale
by
three
quarters
of
a
length.
&quot;That
was
a
great
feeling.
He
was
always
a
good
colt,
and
I
was
hoping
he&#039;d
run
third
or
fourth.
But
he
just
had
one
of
his
good
nights.
Boy,
that
was
some
Christmas
present.&quot;
Trainer
Bertrand
now
comes
back
into
the
picture,
and
asks
the
rejuvenated
Wiley
to
be
his
first-call
rider
once
again.
So
this
past
spring,
Wiley
returns
to
Del
Rio.
As
luck
would
have
it,
Bubba
Werner
was
also
at
Del
Rio,
with
Dave
Morris
as
his
first-call
rider.
But
Morris
got
flattened
out
when
a
horse
shied
from
the
crowd,
took
a
left
turn
and
went
over
the
rail
near
the
finish
line.
This
left
Werner
without
a
jockey
for
his
stakes-winning
filly,
Oedra&#039;sUh
Oh.
Shortly
after
Morris&#039;
spill,
as
Wiley
was
walking
back
to
the
jockey
quarters,
Werner&#039;s
assistant,
Johnny
Bustamante,
was
waiting
for
him.
&quot;You
want
to
ride
our
filly?&quot;
he
asked.
As
it
turned
out,
Wiley&#039;s
riding
had
caught
Werner&#039;s
attention.
Wiley,
not
one
to
let
Opportunity
pass
him
by
for
a
second
time,
shot
back:
&quot;Yes,
Sir!
You
bet!&quot;
So
the
next
day,
Wiley
rode
Dedra&#039;s
Uh
Oh
in
a
stakes
race
at
Del
Rio,
and
won
in
blazing
time.
Later,
Werner
suggested
Wiley
might
like
to
come
up
to
Ruidoso
Downs
as
a
gallop
boy
and
understudy
to
Morris
(who
had
recovered
quickly
from
that
spill).
Things
took
an
unexpected
turn
in
Wiley&#039;s
favor
when,
at
,
the
start
of
the
meeting,
Werner
and
Morris
didn&#039;t
exactly
see
things
eye-to-eye,
and
dissolved
their
working
arrangement.
&quot;Bubba
told
me
he
was
going
to
give
me
a
chance
for
two
weeks,&quot;
Wiley
says.
During
that
two-week
period,
Wiley
had
about
nine
mounts,
won
with
four
or
five
—
including
Sheswright,
who
zipped
over
350
yards
in
a
fiery
17
46
seconds.
Werner
said
approvingly:
&quot;Well,
I
guess
you
can
ride
as
fast
as
anyone
else
From
that
point
on,
Wiley
s
been
riding
first-call
for
Werner.
So
you
review
all
this,
and
it
seems
to
go
back
to
pure
chance.
If
Morris
hadn&#039;t
gotten
hurt
—
if
Werner
hadn&#039;t
picked
him
out
-
Wiley
wouldn&#039;t
be
where
he
is
today.
Quite
likely,
he&#039;d
still
be
beating
his
brains
out
on
the
Texas
flatlands,
dreaming
of
that
one
